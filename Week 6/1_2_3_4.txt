These apples were always counted, and about\r\nthe time when they began to grow ripe it was found that every night one\r\nof them was gone. The king became very angry at this, and ordered the\r\ngardener to keep watch all night under the tree. The gardener set his\r\neldest son to watch; but about twelve o\xe2\x80\x99clock he fell asleep, and in\r\nthe morning another of the apples was missing. Then the second son was\r\nordered to watch; and at midnight he too fell asleep, and in the morning\r\nanother apple was gone. Then the third son offered to keep watch; but\r\nthe gardener at first would not let him, for fear some harm should come\r\nto him: however, at last he consented, and the young man laid himself\r\nunder the tree to watch. As the clock struck twelve he heard a rustling\r\nnoise in the air, and a bird came flying that was of pure gold; and as\r\nit was snapping at one of the apples with its beak, the gardener\xe2\x80\x99s son\r\njumped up and shot an arrow at it. But the arrow did the bird no harm;\r\nonly it dropped a golden feather from its tail, and then flew away.\r\nThe golden feather was brought to the king in the morning, and all the\r\ncouncil was called together. Everyone agreed that it was worth more than\r\nall the wealth of the kingdom: but the king said, \xe2\x80\x98One feather is of no\r\nuse to me, I must have the whole bird.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThen the gardener\xe2\x80\x99s eldest son set out and thought to find the golden\r\nbird very easily; and when he had gone but a little way, he came to a\r\nwood, and by the side of the wood he saw a fox sitting; so he took his\r\nbow and made ready to shoot at it. Then the fox said, \xe2\x80\x98Do not shoot me,\r\nfor I will give you good counsel; I know what your business is, and\r\nthat you want to find the golden bird. You will reach a village in the\r\nevening; and when you get there, you will see two inns opposite to each\r\nother, one of which is very pleasant and beautiful to look at: go not in\r\nthere, but rest for the night in the other, though it may appear to you\r\nto be very poor and mean.\xe2\x80\x99 But the son thought to himself, \xe2\x80\x98What can\r\nsuch a beast as this know about the matter?\xe2\x80\x99 So he shot his arrow at\r\nthe fox; but he missed it, and it set up its tail above its back and\r\nran into the wood. Then he went his way, and in the evening came to\r\nthe village where the two inns were; and in one of these were people\r\nsinging, and dancing, and feasting; but the other looked very dirty,\r\nand poor. \xe2\x80\x98I should be very silly,\xe2\x80\x99 said he, \xe2\x80\x98if I went to that shabby\r\nhouse, and left this charming place\xe2\x80\x99; so he went into the smart house,\r\nand ate and drank at his ease, and forgot the bird, and his country too.\r\n\r\nTime passed on; and as the eldest son did not come back, and no tidings\r\nwere heard of him, the second son set out, and the same thing happened\r\nto him. He met the fox, who gave him the good advice: but when he came\r\nto the two inns, his eldest brother was standing at the window where\r\nthe merrymaking was, and called to him to come in; and he could not\r\nwithstand the temptation, but went in, and forgot the golden bird and\r\nhis country in the same manner.\r\n\r\nTime passed on again, and the youngest son too wished to set out into\r\nthe wide world to seek for the golden bird; but his father would not\r\nlisten to it for a long while, for he was very fond of his son, and\r\nwas afraid that some ill luck might happen to him also, and prevent his\r\ncoming back. However, at last it was agreed he should go, for he would\r\nnot rest at home; and as he came to the wood, he met the fox, and heard\r\nthe same good counsel. But he was thankful to the fox, and did not\r\nattempt his life as his brothers had done; so the fox said, \xe2\x80\x98Sit upon my\r\ntail, and you will travel faster.\xe2\x80\x99 So he sat down, and the fox began to\r\nrun, and away they went over stock and stone so quick that their hair\r\nwhistled in the wind.\r\n\r\nWhen they came to the village, the son followed the fox\xe2\x80\x99s counsel, and\r\nwithout looking about him went to the shabby inn and rested there all\r\nnight at his ease. In the morning came the fox again and met him as he\r\nwas beginning his journey, and said, \xe2\x80\x98Go straight forward, till you come\r\nto a castle, before which lie a whole troop of soldiers fast asleep and\r\nsnoring: take no notice of them, but go into the castle and pass on and\r\non till you come to a room, where the golden bird sits in a wooden cage;\r\nclose by it stands a beautiful golden cage; but do not try to take the\r\nbird out of the shabby cage and put it into the handsome one, otherwise\r\nyou will repent it.\xe2\x80\x99 Then the fox stretched out his tail again, and the\r\nyoung man sat himself down, and away they went over stock and stone till\r\ntheir hair whistled in the wind.\r\n\r\nBefore the castle gate all was as the fox had said: so the son went in\r\nand found the chamber where the golden bird hung in a wooden cage, and\r\nbelow stood the golden cage, and the three golden apples that had been\r\nlost were lying close by it. Then thought he to himself, \xe2\x80\x98It will be a\r\nvery droll thing to bring away such a fine bird in this shabby cage\xe2\x80\x99; so\r\nhe opened the door and took hold of it and put it into the golden cage.\r\nBut the bird set up such a loud scream that all the soldiers awoke, and\r\nthey took him prisoner and carried him before the king. The next morning\r\nthe court sat to judge him; and when all was heard, it sentenced him to\r\ndie, unless he should bring the king the golden horse which could run as\r\nswiftly as the wind; and if he did this, he was to have the golden bird\r\ngiven him for his own.\r\n\r\nSo he set out once more on his journey, sighing, and in great despair,\r\nwhen on a sudden his friend the fox met him, and said, \xe2\x80\x98You see now\r\nwhat has happened on account of your not listening to my counsel. I will\r\nstill, however, tell you how to find the golden horse, if you will do as\r\nI bid you. You must go straight on till you come to the castle where the\r\nhorse stands in his stall: by his side will lie the groom fast asleep\r\nand snoring: take away the horse quietly, but be sure to put the old\r\nleathern saddle upon him, and not the golden one that is close by it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\nThen the son sat down on the fox\xe2\x80\x99s tail, and away they went over stock\r\nand stone till their hair whistled in the wind.\r\n\r\nAll went right, and the groom lay snoring with his hand upon the golden\r\nsaddle. But when the son looked at the horse, he thought it a great pity\r\nto put the leathern saddle upon it. \xe2\x80\x98I will give him the good one,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsaid he; \xe2\x80\x98I am sure he deserves it.\xe2\x80\x99 As he took up the golden saddle the\r\ngroom awoke and cried out so loud, that all the guards ran in and took\r\nhim prisoner, and in the morning he was again brought before the court\r\nto be judged, and was sentenced to die. But it was agreed, that, if he\r\ncould bring thither the beautiful princess, he should live, and have the\r\nbird and the horse given him for his own.\r\n\r\nThen he went his way very sorrowful; but the old fox came and said, \xe2\x80\x98Why\r\ndid not you listen to me? If you had, you would have carried away\r\nboth the bird and the horse; yet will I once more give you counsel. Go\r\nstraight on, and in the evening you will arrive at a castle. At twelve\r\no\xe2\x80\x99clock at night the princess goes to the bathing-house: go up to her\r\nand give her a kiss, and she will let you lead her away; but take care\r\nyou do not suffer her to go and take leave of her father and mother.\xe2\x80\x99\r\nThen the fox stretched out his tail, and so away they went over stock\r\nand stone till their hair whistled again.\r\n\r\nAs they came to the castle, all was as the fox had said, and at twelve\r\no\xe2\x80\x99clock the young man met the princess going to the bath and gave her the\r\nkiss, and she agreed to run away with him, but begged with many tears\r\nthat he would let her take leave of her father. At first he refused,\r\nbut she wept still more and more, and fell at his feet, till at last\r\nhe consented; but the moment she came to her father\xe2\x80\x99s house the guards\r\nawoke and he was taken prisoner again.\r\n\r\nThen he was brought before the king, and the king said, \xe2\x80\x98You shall never\r\nhave my daughter unless in eight days you dig away the hill that stops\r\nthe view from my window.\xe2\x80\x99 Now this hill was so big that the whole world\r\ncould not take it away: and when he had worked for seven days, and had\r\ndone very little, the fox came and said. \xe2\x80\x98Lie down and go to sleep; I\r\nwill work for you.\xe2\x80\x99 And in the morning he awoke and the hill was gone;\r\nso he went merrily to the king, and told him that now that it was\r\nremoved he must give him the princess.\r\n\r\nThen the king was obliged to keep his word, and away went the young man\r\nand the princess; and the fox came and said to him, \xe2\x80\x98We will have all\r\nthree, the princess, the horse, and the bird.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Ah!\xe2\x80\x99 said the young man,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98that would be a great thing, but how can you contrive it?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If you will only listen,\xe2\x80\x99 said the fox, \xe2\x80\x98it can be done. When you come\r\nto the king, and he asks for the beautiful princess, you must say, \xe2\x80\x9cHere\r\nshe is!\xe2\x80\x9d Then he will be very joyful; and you will mount the golden\r\nhorse that they are to give you, and put out your hand to take leave of\r\nthem; but shake hands with the princess last. Then lift her quickly on\r\nto the horse behind you; clap your spurs to his side, and gallop away as\r\nfast as you can.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAll went right: then the fox said, \xe2\x80\x98When you come to the castle where\r\nthe bird is, I will stay with the princess at the door, and you will\r\nride in and speak to the king; and when he sees that it is the right\r\nhorse, he will bring out the bird; but you must sit still, and say that\r\nyou want to look at it, to see whether it is the true golden bird; and\r\nwhen you get it into your hand, ride away.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThis, too, happened as the fox said; they carried off the bird, the\r\nprincess mounted again, and they rode on to a great wood. Then the fox\r\ncame, and said, \xe2\x80\x98Pray kill me, and cut off my head and my feet.\xe2\x80\x99 But the\r\nyoung man refused to do it: so the fox said, \xe2\x80\x98I will at any rate give\r\nyou good counsel: beware of two things; ransom no one from the gallows,\r\nand sit down by the side of no river.\xe2\x80\x99 Then away he went. \xe2\x80\x98Well,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nthought the young man, \xe2\x80\x98it is no hard matter to keep that advice.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe rode on with the princess, till at last he came to the village where\r\nhe had left his two brothers. And there he heard a great noise and\r\nuproar; and when he asked what was the matter, the people said, \xe2\x80\x98Two men\r\nare going to be hanged.\xe2\x80\x99 As he came nearer, he saw that the two men were\r\nhis brothers, who had turned robbers; so he said, \xe2\x80\x98Cannot they in any\r\nway be saved?\xe2\x80\x99 But the people said \xe2\x80\x98No,\xe2\x80\x99 unless he would bestow all his\r\nmoney upon the rascals and buy their liberty. Then he did not stay to\r\nthink about the matter, but paid what was asked, and his brothers were\r\ngiven up, and went on with him towards their home.\r\n\r\nAnd as they came to the wood where the fox first met them, it was so\r\ncool and pleasant that the two brothers said, \xe2\x80\x98Let us sit down by the\r\nside of the river, and rest a while, to eat and drink.\xe2\x80\x99 So he said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes,\xe2\x80\x99 and forgot the fox\xe2\x80\x99s counsel, and sat down on the side of the\r\nriver; and while he suspected nothing, they came behind, and threw him\r\ndown the bank, and took the princess, the horse, and the bird, and went\r\nhome to the king their master, and said. \xe2\x80\x98All this have we won by our\r\nlabour.\xe2\x80\x99 Then there was great rejoicing made; but the horse would not\r\neat, the bird would not sing, and the princess wept.\r\n\r\nThe youngest son fell to the bottom of the river\xe2\x80\x99s bed: luckily it was\r\nnearly dry, but his bones were almost broken, and the bank was so steep\r\nthat he could find no way to get out. Then the old fox came once more,\r\nand scolded him for not following his advice; otherwise no evil would\r\nhave befallen him: \xe2\x80\x98Yet,\xe2\x80\x99 said he, \xe2\x80\x98I cannot leave you here, so lay hold\r\nof my tail and hold fast.\xe2\x80\x99 Then he pulled him out of the river, and said\r\nto him, as he got upon the bank, \xe2\x80\x98Your brothers have set watch to kill\r\nyou, if they find you in the kingdom.\xe2\x80\x99 So he dressed himself as a poor\r\nman, and came secretly to the king\xe2\x80\x99s court, and was scarcely within the\r\ndoors when the horse began to eat, and the bird to sing, and the princess\r\nleft off weeping. Then he went to the king, and told him all his\r\nbrothers\xe2\x80\x99 roguery; and they were seized and punished, and he had the\r\nprincess given to him again; and after the king\xe2\x80\x99s death he was heir to\r\nhis kingdom.\r\n\r\nA long while after, he went to walk one day in the wood, and the old fox\r\nmet him, and besought him with tears in his eyes to kill him, and cut\r\noff his head and feet. And at last he did so, and in a moment the\r\nfox was changed into a man, and turned out to be the brother of the\r\nprincess, who had been lost a great many many years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHANS IN LUCK\r\n\r\nSome men are born to good luck: all they do or try to do comes\r\nright--all that falls to them is so much gain--all their geese are\r\nswans--all their cards are trumps--toss them which way you will, they\r\nwill always, like poor puss, alight upon their legs, and only move on so\r\nmuch the faster. The world may very likely not always think of them as\r\nthey think of themselves, but what care they for the world? what can it\r\nknow about the matter?\r\n\r\nOne of these lucky beings was neighbour Hans. Seven long years he had\r\nworked hard for his master. At last he said, \xe2\x80\x98Master, my time is up; I\r\nmust go home and see my poor mother once more: so pray pay me my wages\r\nand let me go.\xe2\x80\x99 And the master said, \xe2\x80\x98You have been a faithful and good\r\nservant, Hans, so your pay shall be handsome.\xe2\x80\x99 Then he gave him a lump\r\nof silver as big as his head.\r\n\r\nHans took out his pocket-handkerchief, put the piece of silver into it,\r\nthrew it over his shoulder, and jogged off on his road homewards. As he\r\nwent lazily on, dragging one foot after another, a man came in sight,\r\ntrotting gaily along on a capital horse. \xe2\x80\x98Ah!\xe2\x80\x99 said Hans aloud, \xe2\x80\x98what a\r\nfine thing it is to ride on horseback! There he sits as easy and happy\r\nas if he was at home, in the chair by his fireside; he trips against no\r\nstones, saves shoe-leather, and gets on he hardly knows how.\xe2\x80\x99 Hans did\r\nnot speak so softly but the horseman heard it all, and said, \xe2\x80\x98Well,\r\nfriend, why do you go on foot then?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Ah!\xe2\x80\x99 said he, \xe2\x80\x98I have this load to\r\ncarry: to be sure it is silver, but it is so heavy that I can\xe2\x80\x99t hold up\r\nmy head, and you must know it hurts my shoulder sadly.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98What do you say\r\nof making an exchange?\xe2\x80\x99 said the horseman. \xe2\x80\x98I will give you my horse,\r\nand you shall give me the silver; which will save you a great deal of\r\ntrouble in carrying such a heavy load about with you.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98With all my\r\nheart,\xe2\x80\x99 said Hans: \xe2\x80\x98but as you are so kind to me, I must tell you one\r\nthing--you will have a weary task to draw that silver about with you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\nHowever, the horseman got off, took the silver, helped Hans up, gave him\r\nthe bridle into one hand and the whip into the other, and said, \xe2\x80\x98When\r\nyou want to go very fast, smack your lips loudly together, and cry\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJip!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHans was delighted as he sat on the horse, drew himself up, squared his\r\nelbows, turned out his toes, cracked his whip, and rode merrily off, one\r\nminute whistling a merry tune, and another singing,\r\n\r\n \xe2\x80\x98No care and no sorrow,\r\n  A fig for the morrow!\r\n  We\xe2\x80\x99ll laugh and be merry,\r\n  Sing neigh down derry!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAfter a time he thought he should like to go a little faster, so he\r\nsmacked his lips and cried \xe2\x80\x98Jip!\xe2\x80\x99 Away went the horse full gallop; and\r\nbefore Hans knew what he was about, he was thrown off, and lay on his\r\nback by the road-side. His horse would have ran off, if a shepherd who\r\nwas coming by, driving a cow, had not stopped it. Hans soon came to\r\nhimself, and got upon his legs again, sadly vexed, and said to the\r\nshepherd, \xe2\x80\x98This riding is no joke, when a man has the luck to get upon\r\na beast like this that stumbles and flings him off as if it would break\r\nhis neck. However, I\xe2\x80\x99m off now once for all: I like your cow now a great\r\ndeal better than this smart beast that played me this trick, and has\r\nspoiled my best coat, you see, in this puddle; which, by the by, smells\r\nnot very like a nosegay. One can walk along at one\xe2\x80\x99s leisure behind that\r\ncow--keep good company, and have milk, butter, and cheese, every day,\r\ninto the bargain. What would I give to have such a prize!\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Well,\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nthe shepherd, \xe2\x80\x98if you are so fond of her, I will change my cow for your\r\nhorse; I like to do good to my neighbours, even though I lose by it\r\nmyself.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Done!\xe2\x80\x99 said Hans, merrily. \xe2\x80\x98What a noble heart that good man\r\nhas!\xe2\x80\x99 thought he. Then the shepherd jumped upon the horse, wished Hans\r\nand the cow good morning, and away he rode.\r\n\r\nHans brushed his coat, wiped his face and hands, rested a while, and\r\nthen drove off his cow quietly, and thought his bargain a very lucky\r\none. \xe2\x80\x98If I have only a piece of bread (and I certainly shall always be\r\nable to get that), I can, whenever I like, eat my butter and cheese with\r\nit; and when I am thirsty I can milk my cow and drink the milk: and what\r\ncan I wish for more?\xe2\x80\x99 When he came to an inn, he halted, ate up all his\r\nbread, and gave away his last penny for a glass of beer. When he had\r\nrested himself he set off again, driving his cow towards his mother\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nvillage. But the heat grew greater as soon as noon came on, till at\r\nlast, as he found himself on a wide heath that would take him more than\r\nan hour to cross, he began to be so hot and parched that his tongue\r\nclave to the roof of his mouth. \xe2\x80\x98I can find a cure for this,\xe2\x80\x99 thought\r\nhe; \xe2\x80\x98now I will milk my cow and quench my thirst\xe2\x80\x99: so he tied her to the\r\nstump of a tree, and held his leathern cap to milk into; but not a drop\r\nwas to be had. Who would have thought that this cow, which was to bring\r\nhim milk and butter and cheese, was all that time utterly dry? Hans had\r\nnot thought of looking to that.\r\n\r\nWhile he was trying his luck in milking, and managing the matter very\r\nclumsily, the uneasy beast began to think him very troublesome; and at\r\nlast gave him such a kick on the head as knocked him down; and there he\r\nlay a long while senseless. Luckily a butcher soon came by, driving a\r\npig in a wheelbarrow. \xe2\x80\x98What is the matter with you, my man?\xe2\x80\x99 said the\r\nbutcher, as he helped him up. Hans told him what had happened, how he\r\nwas dry, and wanted to milk his cow, but found the cow was dry too. Then\r\nthe butcher gave him a flask of ale, saying, \xe2\x80\x98There, drink and refresh\r\nyourself; your cow will give you no milk: don\xe2\x80\x99t you see she is an old\r\nbeast, good for nothing but the slaughter-house?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Alas, alas!\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nHans, \xe2\x80\x98who would have thought it? What a shame to take my horse, and\r\ngive me only a dry cow! If I kill her, what will she be good for? I hate\r\ncow-beef; it is not tender enough for me. If it were a pig now--like\r\nthat fat gentleman you are driving along at his ease--one could do\r\nsomething with it; it would at any rate make sausages.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Well,\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nthe butcher, \xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t like to say no, when one is asked to do a kind,\r\nneighbourly thing. To please you I will change, and give you my fine fat\r\npig for the cow.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Heaven reward you for your kindness and self-denial!\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsaid Hans, as he gave the butcher the cow; and taking the pig off the\r\nwheel-barrow, drove it away, holding it by the string that was tied to\r\nits leg.\r\n\r\nSo on he jogged, and all seemed now to go right with him: he had met\r\nwith some misfortunes, to be sure; but he was now well repaid for all.\r\nHow could it be otherwise with such a travelling companion as he had at\r\nlast got?\r\n\r\nThe next man he met was a countryman carrying a fine white goose. The\r\ncountryman stopped to ask what was o\xe2\x80\x99clock; this led to further chat;\r\nand Hans told him all his luck, how he had so many good bargains, and\r\nhow all the world went gay and smiling with him. The countryman then\r\nbegan to tell his tale, and said he was going to take the goose to a\r\nchristening. \xe2\x80\x98Feel,\xe2\x80\x99 said he, \xe2\x80\x98how heavy it is, and yet it is only eight\r\nweeks old. Whoever roasts and eats it will find plenty of fat upon it,\r\nit has lived so well!\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98You\xe2\x80\x99re right,\xe2\x80\x99 said Hans, as he weighed it in\r\nhis hand; \xe2\x80\x98but if you talk of fat, my pig is no trifle.\xe2\x80\x99 Meantime the\r\ncountryman began to look grave, and shook his head. \xe2\x80\x98Hark ye!\xe2\x80\x99 said he,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98my worthy friend, you seem a good sort of fellow, so I can\xe2\x80\x99t help doing\r\nyou a kind turn. Your pig may get you into a scrape. In the village I\r\njust came from, the squire has had a pig stolen out of his sty. I was\r\ndreadfully afraid when I saw you that you had got the squire\xe2\x80\x99s pig. If\r\nyou have, and they catch you, it will be a bad job for you. The least\r\nthey will do will be to throw you into the horse-pond. Can you swim?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nPoor Hans was sadly frightened. \xe2\x80\x98Good man,\xe2\x80\x99 cried he, \xe2\x80\x98pray get me out\r\nof this scrape. I know nothing of where the pig was either bred or born;\r\nbut he may have been the squire\xe2\x80\x99s for aught I can tell: you know this\r\ncountry better than I do, take my pig and give me the goose.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98I ought\r\nto have something into the bargain,\xe2\x80\x99 said the countryman; \xe2\x80\x98give a fat\r\ngoose for a pig, indeed! \xe2\x80\x98Tis not everyone would do so much for you as\r\nthat. However, I will not be hard upon you, as you are in trouble.\xe2\x80\x99 Then\r\nhe took the string in his hand, and drove off the pig by a side path;\r\nwhile Hans went on the way homewards free from care. \xe2\x80\x98After all,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nthought he, \xe2\x80\x98that chap is pretty well taken in. I don\xe2\x80\x99t care whose pig\r\nit is, but wherever it came from it has been a very good friend to me. I\r\nhave much the best of the bargain. First there will be a capital roast;\r\nthen the fat will find me in goose-grease for six months; and then there\r\nare all the beautiful white feathers. I will put them into my pillow,\r\nand then I am sure I shall sleep soundly without rocking. How happy my\r\nmother will be! Talk of a pig, indeed! Give me a fine fat goose.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAs he came to the next village, he saw a scissor-grinder with his wheel,\r\nworking and singing,\r\n\r\n \xe2\x80\x98O\xe2\x80\x99er hill and o\xe2\x80\x99er dale\r\n  So happy I roam,\r\n  Work light and live well,\r\n  All the world is my home;\r\n  Then who so blythe, so merry as I?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHans stood looking on for a while, and at last said, \xe2\x80\x98You must be well\r\noff, master grinder! you seem so happy at your work.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Yes,\xe2\x80\x99 said the\r\nother, \xe2\x80\x98mine is a golden trade; a good grinder never puts his hand\r\ninto his pocket without finding money in it--but where did you get that\r\nbeautiful goose?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98I did not buy it, I gave a pig for it.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98And where\r\ndid you get the pig?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98I gave a cow for it.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98And the cow?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98I gave a\r\nhorse for it.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98And the horse?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98I gave a lump of silver as big as my\r\nhead for it.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98And the silver?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Oh! I worked hard for that seven long\r\nyears.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98You have thriven well in the world hitherto,\xe2\x80\x99 said the grinder,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98now if you could find money in your pocket whenever you put your hand\r\nin it, your fortune would be made.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Very true: but how is that to be\r\nmanaged?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98How? Why, you must turn grinder like myself,\xe2\x80\x99 said the other;\r\n\xe2\x80\x98you only want a grindstone; the rest will come of itself. Here is one\r\nthat is but little the worse for wear: I would not ask more than the\r\nvalue of your goose for it--will you buy?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98How can you ask?\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nHans; \xe2\x80\x98I should be the happiest man in the world, if I could have money\r\nwhenever I put my hand in my pocket: what could I want more? there\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nthe goose.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Now,\xe2\x80\x99 said the grinder, as he gave him a common rough stone\r\nthat lay by his side, \xe2\x80\x98this is a most capital stone; do but work it well\r\nenough, and you can make an old nail cut with it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHans took the stone, and went his way with a light heart: his eyes\r\nsparkled for joy, and he said to himself, \xe2\x80\x98Surely I must have been born\r\nin a lucky hour; everything I could want or wish for comes of itself.\r\nPeople are so kind; they seem really to think I do them a favour in\r\nletting them make me rich, and giving me good bargains.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMeantime he began to be tired, and hungry too, for he had given away his\r\nlast penny in his joy at getting the cow.\r\n\r\nAt last he could go no farther, for the stone tired him sadly: and he\r\ndragged himself to the side of a river, that he might take a drink of\r\nwater, and rest a while. So he laid the stone carefully by his side on\r\nthe bank: but, as he stooped down to drink, he forgot it, pushed it a\r\nlittle, and down it rolled, plump into the stream.\r\n\r\nFor a while he watched it sinking in the deep clear water; then sprang\r\nup and danced for joy, and again fell upon his knees and thanked Heaven,\r\nwith tears in his eyes, for its kindness in taking away his only plague,\r\nthe ugly heavy stone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How happy am I!\xe2\x80\x99 cried he; \xe2\x80\x98nobody was ever so lucky as I.\xe2\x80\x99 Then up he\r\ngot with a light heart, free from all his troubles, and walked on till\r\nhe reached his mother\xe2\x80\x99s house, and told her how very easy the road to\r\ngood luck was.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJORINDA AND JORINDEL\r\n\r\nThere was once an old castle, that stood in the middle of a deep gloomy\r\nwood, and in the castle lived an old fairy. Now this fairy could take\r\nany shape she pleased. All the day long she flew about in the form of\r\nan owl, or crept about the country like a cat; but at night she always\r\nbecame an old woman again. When any young man came within a hundred\r\npaces of her castle, he became quite fixed, and could not move a step\r\ntill she came and set him free; which she would not do till he had given\r\nher his word never to come there again: but when any pretty maiden came\r\nwithin that space she was changed into a bird, and the fairy put her\r\ninto a cage, and hung her up in a chamber in the castle. There were\r\nseven hundred of these cages hanging in the castle, and all with\r\nbeautiful birds in them.\r\n\r\nNow there was once a maiden whose name was Jorinda. She was prettier\r\nthan all the pretty girls that ever were seen before, and a shepherd\r\nlad, whose name was Jorindel, was very fond of her, and they were soon\r\nto be married. One day they went to walk in the wood, that they might be\r\nalone; and Jorindel said, \xe2\x80\x98We must take care that we don\xe2\x80\x99t go too near\r\nto the fairy\xe2\x80\x99s castle.\xe2\x80\x99 It was a beautiful evening; the last rays of the\r\nsetting sun shone bright through the long stems of the trees upon\r\nthe green underwood beneath, and the turtle-doves sang from the tall\r\nbirches.\r\n\r\nJorinda sat down to gaze upon the sun; Jorindel sat by her side; and\r\nboth felt sad, they knew not why; but it seemed as if they were to be\r\nparted from one another for ever. They had wandered a long way; and when\r\nthey looked to see which way they should go home, they found themselves\r\nat a loss to know what path to take.\r\n\r\nThe sun was setting fast, and already half of its circle had sunk behind\r\nthe hill: Jorindel on a sudden looked behind him, and saw through the\r\nbushes that they had, without knowing it, sat down close under the old\r\nwalls of the castle. Then he shrank for fear, turned pale, and trembled.\r\nJorinda was just singing,\r\n\r\n \xe2\x80\x98The ring-dove sang from the willow spray,\r\n  Well-a-day! Well-a-day!\r\n  He mourn\xe2\x80\x99d for the fate of his darling mate,\r\n  Well-a-day!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nwhen her song stopped suddenly. Jorindel turned to see the reason, and\r\nbeheld his Jorinda changed into a nightingale, so that her song ended\r\nwith a mournful _jug, jug_. An owl with fiery eyes flew three times\r\nround them, and three times screamed:\r\n\r\n \xe2\x80\x98Tu whu! Tu whu! Tu whu!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nJorindel could not move; he stood fixed as a stone, and could neither\r\nweep, nor speak, nor stir hand or foot. And now the sun went quite down;\r\nthe gloomy night came; the owl flew into a bush; and a moment after the\r\nold fairy came forth pale and meagre, with staring eyes, and a nose and\r\nchin that almost met one another.\r\n\r\nShe mumbled something to herself, seized the nightingale, and went away\r\nwith it in her hand. Poor Jorindel saw the nightingale was gone--but\r\nwhat could he do? He could not speak, he could not move from the spot\r\nwhere he stood. At last the fairy came back and sang with a hoarse\r\nvoice:\r\n\r\n \xe2\x80\x98Till the prisoner is fast,\r\n  And her doom is cast,\r\n  There stay! Oh, stay!\r\n  When the charm is around her,\r\n  And the spell has bound her,\r\n  Hie away! away!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nOn a sudden Jorindel found himself free. Then he fell on his knees\r\nbefore the fairy, and prayed her to give him back his dear Jorinda: but\r\nshe laughed at him, and said he should never see her again; then she\r\nwent her way.\r\n\r\nHe prayed, he wept, he sorrowed, but all in vain. \xe2\x80\x98Alas!\xe2\x80\x99 he said, \xe2\x80\x98what\r\nwill become of me?\xe2\x80\x99 He could not go back to his own home, so he went to\r\na strange village, and employed himself in keeping sheep. Many a time\r\ndid he walk round and round as near to the hated castle as he dared go,\r\nbut all in vain; he heard or saw nothing of Jorinda.\r\n\r\nAt last he dreamt one night that he found a beautiful purple flower,\r\nand that in the middle of it lay a costly pearl; and he dreamt that he\r\nplucked the flower, and went with it in his hand into the castle, and\r\nthat everything he touched with it was disenchanted, and that there he\r\nfound his Jorinda again.\r\n\r\nIn the morning when he awoke, he began to search over hill and dale for\r\nthis pretty flower; and eight long days he sought for it in vain: but\r\non the ninth day, early in the morning, he found the beautiful purple\r\nflower; and in the middle of it was a large dewdrop, as big as a costly\r\npearl. Then he plucked the flower, and set out and travelled day and\r\nnight, till he came again to the castle.\r\n\r\nHe walked nearer than a hundred paces to it, and yet he did not become\r\nfixed as before, but found that he could go quite close up to the door.\r\nJorindel was very glad indeed to see this. Then he touched the door with\r\nthe flower, and it sprang open; so that he went in through the court,\r\nand listened when he heard so many birds singing. At last he came to the\r\nchamber where the fairy sat, with the seven hundred birds singing in\r\nthe seven hundred cages. When she saw Jorindel she was very angry, and\r\nscreamed with rage; but she could not come within two yards of him, for\r\nthe flower he held in his hand was his safeguard. He looked around at\r\nthe birds, but alas! there were many, many nightingales, and how then\r\nshould he find out which was his Jorinda? While he was thinking what to\r\ndo, he saw the fairy had taken down one of the cages, and was making the\r\nbest of her way off through the door. He ran or flew after her, touched\r\nthe cage with the flower, and Jorinda stood before him, and threw her\r\narms round his neck looking as beautiful as ever, as beautiful as when\r\nthey walked together in the wood.\r\n\r\nThen he touched all the other birds with the flower, so that they all\r\ntook their old forms again; and he took Jorinda home, where they were\r\nmarried, and lived happily together many years: and so did a good many\r\nother lads, whose maidens had been forced to sing in the old fairy\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncages by themselves, much longer than they liked.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TRAVELLING MUSICIANS\r\n\r\nAn honest farmer had once an ass that had been a faithful servant to him\r\na great many years, but was now growing old and every day more and more\r\nunfit for work. His master therefore was tired of keeping him and\r\nbegan to think of putting an end to him; but the ass, who saw that some\r\nmischief was in the wind, took himself slyly off, and began his journey\r\ntowards the great city, \xe2\x80\x98For there,\xe2\x80\x99 thought he, \xe2\x80\x98I may turn musician.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAfter he had travelled a little way, he spied a dog lying by the\r\nroadside and panting as if he were tired. \xe2\x80\x98What makes you pant so, my\r\nfriend?\xe2\x80\x99 said the ass. \xe2\x80\x98Alas!\xe2\x80\x99 said the dog, \xe2\x80\x98my master was going to\r\nknock me on the head, because I am old and weak, and can no longer make\r\nmyself useful to him in hunting; so I ran away; but what can I do to\r\nearn my livelihood?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Hark ye!\xe2\x80\x99 said the ass, \xe2\x80\x98I am going to the great\r\ncity to turn musician: suppose you go with me, and try what you can\r\ndo in the same way?\xe2\x80\x99 The dog said he was willing, and they jogged on\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\nThey had not gone far before they saw a cat sitting in the middle of the\r\nroad and making a most rueful face. \xe2\x80\x98Pray, my good lady,\xe2\x80\x99 said the ass,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98what\xe2\x80\x99s the matter with you? You look quite out of spirits!\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Ah, me!\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsaid the cat, \xe2\x80\x98how can one be in good spirits when one\xe2\x80\x99s life is in\r\ndanger? Because I am beginning to grow old, and had rather lie at my\r\nease by the fire than run about the house after the mice, my mistress\r\nlaid hold of me, and was going to drown me; and though I have been lucky\r\nenough to get away from her, I do not know what I am to live upon.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh,\xe2\x80\x99 said the ass, \xe2\x80\x98by all means go with us to the great city; you are\r\na good night singer, and may make your fortune as a musician.\xe2\x80\x99 The cat\r\nwas pleased with the thought, and joined the party.\r\n\r\nSoon afterwards, as they were passing by a farmyard, they saw a cock\r\nperched upon a gate, and screaming out with all his might and main.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Bravo!\xe2\x80\x99 said the ass; \xe2\x80\x98upon my word, you make a famous noise; pray what\r\nis all this about?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Why,\xe2\x80\x99 said the cock, \xe2\x80\x98I was just now saying that\r\nwe should have fine weather for our washing-day, and yet my mistress and\r\nthe cook don\xe2\x80\x99t thank me for my pains, but threaten to cut off my\r\nhead tomorrow, and make broth of me for the guests that are coming\r\non Sunday!\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Heaven forbid!\xe2\x80\x99 said the ass, \xe2\x80\x98come with us Master\r\nChanticleer; it will be better, at any rate, than staying here to have\r\nyour head cut off! Besides, who knows? If we care to sing in tune, we\r\nmay get up some kind of a concert; so come along with us.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98With all my\r\nheart,\xe2\x80\x99 said the cock: so they all four went on jollily together.\r\n\r\nThey could not, however, reach the great city the first day; so when\r\nnight came on, they went into a wood to sleep. The ass and the dog laid\r\nthemselves down under a great tree, and the cat climbed up into the\r\nbranches; while the cock, thinking that the higher he sat the safer he\r\nshould be, flew up to the very top of the tree, and then, according to\r\nhis custom, before he went to sleep, looked out on all sides of him to\r\nsee that everything was well. In doing this, he saw afar off something\r\nbright and shining and calling to his companions said, \xe2\x80\x98There must be a\r\nhouse no great way off, for I see a light.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98If that be the case,\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nthe ass, \xe2\x80\x98we had better change our quarters, for our lodging is not the\r\nbest in the world!\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Besides,\xe2\x80\x99 added the dog, \xe2\x80\x98I should not be the\r\nworse for a bone or two, or a bit of meat.\xe2\x80\x99 So they walked off together\r\ntowards the spot where Chanticleer had seen the light, and as they drew\r\nnear it became larger and brighter, till they at last came close to a\r\nhouse in which a gang of robbers lived.\r\n\r\nThe ass, being the tallest of the company, marched up to the window and\r\npeeped in. \xe2\x80\x98Well, Donkey,\xe2\x80\x99 said Chanticleer, \xe2\x80\x98what do you see?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98What\r\ndo I see?\xe2\x80\x99 replied the ass. \xe2\x80\x98Why, I see a table spread with all kinds of\r\ngood things, and robbers sitting round it making merry.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98That would\r\nbe a noble lodging for us,\xe2\x80\x99 said the cock. \xe2\x80\x98Yes,\xe2\x80\x99 said the ass, \xe2\x80\x98if we\r\ncould only get in\xe2\x80\x99; so they consulted together how they should contrive\r\nto get the robbers out; and at last they hit upon a plan. The ass placed\r\nhimself upright on his hind legs, with his forefeet resting against the\r\nwindow; the dog got upon his back; the cat scrambled up to the dog\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nshoulders, and the cock flew up and sat upon the cat\xe2\x80\x99s head. When\r\nall was ready a signal was given, and they began their music. The ass\r\nbrayed, the dog barked, the cat mewed, and the cock screamed; and then\r\nthey all broke through the window at once, and came tumbling into\r\nthe room, amongst the broken glass, with a most hideous clatter! The\r\nrobbers, who had been not a little frightened by the opening concert,\r\nhad now no doubt that some frightful hobgoblin had broken in upon them,\r\nand scampered away as fast as they could.\r\n\r\nThe coast once clear, our travellers soon sat down and dispatched what\r\nthe robbers had left, with as much eagerness as if they had not expected\r\nto eat again for a month. As soon as they had satisfied themselves, they\r\nput out the lights, and each once more sought out a resting-place to\r\nhis own liking. The donkey laid himself down upon a heap of straw in\r\nthe yard, the dog stretched himself upon a mat behind the door, the\r\ncat rolled herself up on the hearth before the warm ashes, and the\r\ncock perched upon a beam on the top of the house; and, as they were all\r\nrather tired with their journey, they soon fell asleep.\r\n\r\nBut about midnight, when the robbers saw from afar that the lights were\r\nout and that all seemed quiet, they began to think that they had been in\r\ntoo great a hurry to run away; and one of them, who was bolder than\r\nthe rest, went to see what was going on. Finding everything still, he\r\nmarched into the kitchen, and groped about till he found a match in\r\norder to light a candle; and then, espying the glittering fiery eyes of\r\nthe cat, he mistook them for live coals, and held the match to them to\r\nlight it. But the cat, not understanding this joke, sprang at his face,\r\nand spat, and scratched at him. This frightened him dreadfully, and away\r\nhe ran to the back door; but there the dog jumped up and bit him in the\r\nleg; and as he was crossing over the yard the ass kicked him; and the\r\ncock, who had been awakened by the noise, crowed with all his might. At\r\nthis the robber ran back as fast as he could to his comrades, and told\r\nthe captain how a horrid witch had got into the house, and had spat at\r\nhim and scratched his face with her long bony fingers; how a man with a\r\nknife in his hand had hidden himself behind the door, and stabbed him\r\nin the leg; how a black monster stood in the yard and struck him with a\r\nclub, and how the devil had sat upon the top of the house and cried out,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Throw the rascal up here!\xe2\x80\x99 After this the robbers never dared to go\r\nback to the house; but the musicians were so pleased with their quarters\r\nthat they took up their abode there; and there they are, I dare say, at\r\nthis very day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOLD SULTAN\r\n\r\nA shepherd had a faithful dog, called Sultan, who was grown very old,\r\nand had lost all his teeth. And one day when the shepherd and his wife\r\nwere standing together before the house the shepherd said, \xe2\x80\x98I will shoot\r\nold Sultan tomorrow morning, for he is of no use now.\xe2\x80\x99 But his wife\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x98Pray let the poor faithful creature live; he has served us well a\r\ngreat many years, and we ought to give him a livelihood for the rest of\r\nhis days.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98But what can we do with him?\xe2\x80\x99 said the shepherd, \xe2\x80\x98he has not\r\na tooth in his head, and the thieves don\xe2\x80\x99t care for him at all; to\r\nbe sure he has served us, but then he did it to earn his livelihood;\r\ntomorrow shall be his last day, depend upon it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nPoor Sultan, who was lying close by them, heard all that the shepherd\r\nand his wife said to one another, and was very much frightened to think\r\ntomorrow would be his last day; so in the evening he went to his good\r\nfriend the wolf, who lived in the wood, and told him all his sorrows,\r\nand how his master meant to kill him in the morning. \xe2\x80\x98Make yourself\r\neasy,\xe2\x80\x99 said the wolf, \xe2\x80\x98I will give you some good advice. Your master,\r\nyou know, goes out every morning very early with his wife into the\r\nfield; and they take their little child with them, and lay it down\r\nbehind the hedge in the shade while they are at work. Now do you lie\r\ndown close by the child, and pretend to be watching it, and I will come\r\nout of the wood and run away with it; you must run after me as fast as\r\nyou can, and I will let it drop; then you may carry it back, and they\r\nwill think you have saved their child, and will be so thankful to you\r\nthat they will take care of you as long as you live.\xe2\x80\x99 The dog liked this\r\nplan very well; and accordingly so it was managed. The wolf ran with the\r\nchild a little way; the shepherd and his wife screamed out; but Sultan\r\nsoon overtook him, and carried the poor little thing back to his master\r\nand mistress. Then the shepherd patted him on the head, and said, \xe2\x80\x98Old\r\nSultan has saved our child from the wolf, and therefore he shall live\r\nand be well taken care of, and have plenty to eat. Wife, go home, and\r\ngive him a good dinner, and let him have my old cushion to sleep on\r\nas long as he lives.\xe2\x80\x99 So from this time forward Sultan had all that he\r\ncould wish for.\r\n\r\nSoon afterwards the wolf came and wished him joy, and said, \xe2\x80\x98Now, my\r\ngood fellow, you must tell no tales, but turn your head the other way\r\nwhen I want to taste one of the old shepherd\xe2\x80\x99s fine fat sheep.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98No,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsaid the Sultan; \xe2\x80\x98I will be true to my master.\xe2\x80\x99 However, the wolf\r\nthought he was in joke, and came one night to get a dainty morsel. But\r\nSultan had told his master what the wolf meant to do; so he laid wait\r\nfor him behind the barn door, and when the wolf was busy looking out for\r\na good fat sheep, he had a stout cudgel laid about his back, that combed\r\nhis locks for him finely.\r\n\r\nThen the wolf was very angry, and called Sultan \xe2\x80\x98an old rogue,\xe2\x80\x99 and\r\nswore he would have his revenge. So the next morning the wolf sent the\r\nboar to challenge Sultan to come into the wood to fight the matter. Now\r\nSultan had nobody he could ask to be his second but the shepherd\xe2\x80\x99s old\r\nthree-legged cat; so he took her with him, and as the poor thing limped\r\nalong with some trouble, she stuck up her tail straight in the air.\r\n\r\nThe wolf and the wild boar were first on the ground; and when they\r\nespied their enemies coming, and saw the cat\xe2\x80\x99s long tail standing\r\nstraight in the air, they thought she was carrying a sword for Sultan to\r\nfight with; and every time she limped, they thought she was picking up\r\na stone to throw at them; so they said they should not like this way of\r\nfighting, and the boar lay down behind a bush, and the wolf jumped\r\nup into a tree. Sultan and the cat soon came up, and looked about and\r\nwondered that no one was there. The boar, however, had not quite hidden\r\nhimself, for his ears stuck out of the bush; and when he shook one of\r\nthem a little, the cat, seeing something move, and thinking it was a\r\nmouse, sprang upon it, and bit and scratched it, so that the boar jumped\r\nup and grunted, and ran away, roaring out, \xe2\x80\x98Look up in the tree, there\r\nsits the one who is to blame.\xe2\x80\x99 So they looked up, and espied the wolf\r\nsitting amongst the branches; and they called him a cowardly rascal,\r\nand would not suffer him to come down till he was heartily ashamed of\r\nhimself, and had promised to be good friends again with old Sultan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STRAW, THE COAL, AND THE BEAN\r\n\r\nIn a village dwelt a poor old woman, who had gathered together a dish\r\nof beans and wanted to cook them. So she made a fire on her hearth, and\r\nthat it might burn the quicker, she lighted it with a handful of straw.\r\nWhen she was emptying the beans into the pan, one dropped without her\r\nobserving it, and lay on the ground beside a straw, and soon afterwards\r\na burning coal from the fire leapt down to the two. Then the straw\r\nbegan and said: \xe2\x80\x98Dear friends, from whence do you come here?\xe2\x80\x99 The coal\r\nreplied: \xe2\x80\x98I fortunately sprang out of the fire, and if I had not escaped\r\nby sheer force, my death would have been certain,--I should have been\r\nburnt to ashes.\xe2\x80\x99 The bean said: \xe2\x80\x98I too have escaped with a whole skin,\r\nbut if the old woman had got me into the pan, I should have been made\r\ninto broth without any mercy, like my comrades.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98And would a better\r\nfate have fallen to my lot?\xe2\x80\x99 said the straw. \xe2\x80\x98The old woman has\r\ndestroyed all my brethren in fire and smoke; she seized sixty of them at\r\nonce, and took their lives. I luckily slipped through her fingers.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But what are we to do now?\xe2\x80\x99 said the coal.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I think,\xe2\x80\x99 answered the bean, \xe2\x80\x98that as we have so fortunately escaped\r\ndeath, we should keep together like good companions, and lest a new\r\nmischance should overtake us here, we should go away together, and\r\nrepair to a foreign country.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe proposition pleased the two others, and they set out on their way\r\ntogether. Soon, however, they came to a little brook, and as there was\r\nno bridge or foot-plank, they did not know how they were to get over\r\nit. The straw hit on a good idea, and said: \xe2\x80\x98I will lay myself straight\r\nacross, and then you can walk over on me as on a bridge.\xe2\x80\x99 The straw\r\ntherefore stretched itself from one bank to the other, and the coal,\r\nwho was of an impetuous disposition, tripped quite boldly on to the\r\nnewly-built bridge. But when she had reached the middle, and heard the\r\nwater rushing beneath her, she was after all, afraid, and stood still,\r\nand ventured no farther. The straw, however, began to burn, broke in\r\ntwo pieces, and fell into the stream. The coal slipped after her, hissed\r\nwhen she got into the water, and breathed her last. The bean, who had\r\nprudently stayed behind on the shore, could not but laugh at the event,\r\nwas unable to stop, and laughed so heartily that she burst. It would\r\nhave been all over with her, likewise, if, by good fortune, a tailor who\r\nwas travelling in search of work, had not sat down to rest by the brook.\r\nAs he had a compassionate heart he pulled out his needle and thread,\r\nand sewed her together. The bean thanked him most prettily, but as the\r\ntailor used black thread, all beans since then have a black seam.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBRIAR ROSE\r\n\r\nA king and queen once upon a time reigned in a country a great way off,\r\nwhere there were in those days fairies. Now this king and queen had\r\nplenty of money, and plenty of fine clothes to wear, and plenty of\r\ngood things to eat and drink, and a coach to ride out in every day: but\r\nthough they had been married many years they had no children, and this\r\ngrieved them very much indeed. But one day as the queen was walking\r\nby the side of the river, at the bottom of the garden, she saw a poor\r\nlittle fish, that had thrown itself out of the water, and lay gasping\r\nand nearly dead on the bank. Then the queen took pity on the little\r\nfish, and threw it back again into the river; and before it swam away\r\nit lifted its head out of the water and said, \xe2\x80\x98I know what your wish is,\r\nand it shall be fulfilled, in return for your kindness to me--you will\r\nsoon have a daughter.\xe2\x80\x99 What the little fish had foretold soon came to\r\npass; and the queen had a little girl, so very beautiful that the king\r\ncould not cease looking on it for joy, and said he would hold a great\r\nfeast and make merry, and show the child to all the land. So he asked\r\nhis kinsmen, and nobles, and friends, and neighbours. But the queen\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x98I will have the fairies also, that they might be kind and good\r\nto our little daughter.\xe2\x80\x99 Now there were thirteen fairies in the kingdom;\r\nbut as the king and queen had only twelve golden dishes for them to eat\r\nout of, they were forced to leave one of the fairies without asking her.\r\nSo twelve fairies came, each with a high red cap on her head, and red\r\nshoes with high heels on her feet, and a long white wand in her hand:\r\nand after the feast was over they gathered round in a ring and gave all\r\ntheir best gifts to the little princess. One gave her goodness, another\r\nbeauty, another riches, and so on till she had all that was good in the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nJust as eleven of them had done blessing her, a great noise was heard in\r\nthe courtyard, and word was brought that the thirteenth fairy was\r\ncome, with a black cap on her head, and black shoes on her feet, and a\r\nbroomstick in her hand: and presently up she came into the dining-hall.\r\nNow, as she had not been asked to the feast she was very angry, and\r\nscolded the king and queen very much, and set to work to take her\r\nrevenge. So she cried out, \xe2\x80\x98The king\xe2\x80\x99s daughter shall, in her fifteenth\r\nyear, be wounded by a spindle, and fall down dead.\xe2\x80\x99 Then the twelfth of\r\nthe friendly fairies, who had not yet given her gift, came forward, and\r\nsaid that the evil wish must be fulfilled, but that she could soften its\r\nmischief; so her gift was, that the king\xe2\x80\x99s daughter, when the spindle\r\nwounded her, should not really die, but should only fall asleep for a\r\nhundred years.\r\n\r\nHowever, the king hoped still to save his dear child altogether from\r\nthe threatened evil; so he ordered that all the spindles in the kingdom\r\nshould be bought up and burnt. But all the gifts of the first eleven\r\nfairies were in the meantime fulfilled; for the princess was so\r\nbeautiful, and well behaved, and good, and wise, that everyone who knew\r\nher loved her.\r\n\r\nIt happened that, on the very day she was fifteen years old, the king\r\nand queen were not at home, and she was left alone in the palace. So she\r\nroved about by herself, and looked at all the rooms and chambers, till\r\nat last she came to an old tower, to which there was a narrow staircase\r\nending with a little door. In the door there was a golden key, and when\r\nshe turned it the door sprang open, and there sat an old lady spinning\r\naway very busily. \xe2\x80\x98Why, how now, good mother,\xe2\x80\x99 said the princess; \xe2\x80\x98what\r\nare you doing there?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Spinning,\xe2\x80\x99 said the old lady, and nodded her\r\nhead, humming a tune, while buzz! went the wheel. \xe2\x80\x98How prettily that\r\nlittle thing turns round!\xe2\x80\x99 said the princess, and took the spindle\r\nand began to try and spin. But scarcely had she touched it, before the\r\nfairy\xe2\x80\x99s prophecy was fulfilled; the spindle wounded her, and she fell\r\ndown lifeless on the ground.\r\n\r\nHowever, she was not dead, but had only fallen into a deep sleep; and\r\nthe king and the queen, who had just come home, and all their court,\r\nfell asleep too; and the horses slept in the stables, and the dogs in\r\nthe court, the pigeons on the house-top, and the very flies slept upon\r\nthe walls. Even the fire on the hearth left off blazing, and went to\r\nsleep; the jack stopped, and the spit that was turning about with a\r\ngoose upon it for the king\xe2\x80\x99s dinner stood still; and the cook, who was\r\nat that moment pulling the kitchen-boy by the hair to give him a box\r\non the ear for something he had done amiss, let him go, and both fell\r\nasleep; the butler, who was slyly tasting the ale, fell asleep with the\r\njug at his lips: and thus everything stood still, and slept soundly.\r\n\r\nA large hedge of thorns soon grew round the palace, and every year it\r\nbecame higher and thicker; till at last the old palace was surrounded\r\nand hidden, so that not even the roof or the chimneys could be seen. But\r\nthere went a report through all the land of the beautiful sleeping Briar\r\nRose (for so the king\xe2\x80\x99s daughter was called): so that, from time to\r\ntime, several kings\xe2\x80\x99 sons came, and tried to break through the thicket\r\ninto the palace. This, however, none of them could ever do; for the\r\nthorns and bushes laid hold of them, as it were with hands; and there\r\nthey stuck fast, and died wretchedly.\r\n\r\nAfter many, many years there came a king\xe2\x80\x99s son into that land: and an\r\nold man told him the story of the thicket of thorns; and how a beautiful\r\npalace stood behind it, and how a wonderful princess, called Briar Rose,\r\nlay in it asleep, with all her court. He told, too, how he had heard\r\nfrom his grandfather that many, many princes had come, and had tried to\r\nbreak through the thicket, but that they had all stuck fast in it, and\r\ndied. Then the young prince said, \xe2\x80\x98All this shall not frighten me; I\r\nwill go and see this Briar Rose.\xe2\x80\x99 The old man tried to hinder him, but\r\nhe was bent upon going.\r\n\r\nNow that very day the hundred years were ended; and as the prince came\r\nto the thicket he saw nothing but beautiful flowering shrubs, through\r\nwhich he went with ease, and they shut in after him as thick as ever.\r\nThen he came at last to the palace, and there in the court lay the dogs\r\nasleep; and the horses were standing in the stables; and on the roof sat\r\nthe pigeons fast asleep, with their heads under their wings. And when he\r\ncame into the palace, the flies were sleeping on the walls; the spit\r\nwas standing still; the butler had the jug of ale at his lips, going\r\nto drink a draught; the maid sat with a fowl in her lap ready to be\r\nplucked; and the cook in the kitchen was still holding up her hand, as\r\nif she was going to beat the boy.\r\n\r\nThen he went on still farther, and all was so still that he could hear\r\nevery breath he drew; till at last he came to the old tower, and opened\r\nthe door of the little room in which Briar Rose was; and there she lay,\r\nfast asleep on a couch by the window. She looked so beautiful that he\r\ncould not take his eyes off her, so he stooped down and gave her a kiss.\r\nBut the moment he kissed her she opened her eyes and awoke, and smiled\r\nupon him; and they went out together; and soon the king and queen also\r\nawoke, and all the court, and gazed on each other with great wonder.\r\nAnd the horses shook themselves, and the dogs jumped up and barked; the\r\npigeons took their heads from under their wings, and looked about and\r\nflew into the fields; the flies on the walls buzzed again; the fire in\r\nthe kitchen blazed up; round went the jack, and round went the spit,\r\nwith the goose for the king\xe2\x80\x99s dinner upon it; the butler finished his\r\ndraught of ale; the maid went on plucking the fowl; and the cook gave\r\nthe boy the box on his ear.\r\n\r\nAnd then the prince and Briar Rose were married, and the wedding feast\r\nwas given; and they lived happily together all their lives long.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DOG AND THE SPARROW\r\n\r\nA shepherd\xe2\x80\x99s dog had a master who took no care of him, but often let him\r\nsuffer the greatest hunger. At last he could bear it no longer; so he\r\ntook to his heels, and off he ran in a very sad and sorrowful mood.\r\nOn the road he met a sparrow that said to him, \xe2\x80\x98Why are you so sad,\r\nmy friend?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Because,\xe2\x80\x99 said the dog, \xe2\x80\x98I am very very hungry, and have\r\nnothing to eat.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98If that be all,\xe2\x80\x99 answered the sparrow, \xe2\x80\x98come with me\r\ninto the next town, and I will soon find you plenty of food.\xe2\x80\x99 So on they\r\nwent together into the town: and as they passed by a butcher\xe2\x80\x99s shop,\r\nthe sparrow said to the dog, \xe2\x80\x98Stand there a little while till I peck you\r\ndown a piece of meat.\xe2\x80\x99 So the sparrow perched upon the shelf: and having\r\nfirst looked carefully about her to see if anyone was watching her, she\r\npecked and scratched at a steak that lay upon the edge of the shelf,\r\ntill at last down it fell. Then the dog snapped it up, and scrambled\r\naway with it into a corner, where he soon ate it all up. \xe2\x80\x98Well,\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nthe sparrow, \xe2\x80\x98you shall have some more if you will; so come with me to\r\nthe next shop, and I will peck you down another steak.\xe2\x80\x99 When the dog had\r\neaten this too, the sparrow said to him, \xe2\x80\x98Well, my good friend, have you\r\nhad enough now?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98I have had plenty of meat,\xe2\x80\x99 answered he, \xe2\x80\x98but I should\r\nlike to have a piece of bread to eat after it.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Come with me then,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsaid the sparrow, \xe2\x80\x98and you shall soon have that too.\xe2\x80\x99 So she took him\r\nto a baker\xe2\x80\x99s shop, and pecked at two rolls that lay in the window, till\r\nthey fell down: and as the dog still wished for more, she took him to\r\nanother shop and pecked down some more for him. When that was eaten, the\r\nsparrow asked him whether he had had enough now. \xe2\x80\x98Yes,\xe2\x80\x99 said he; \xe2\x80\x98and\r\nnow let us take a walk a little way out of the town.\xe2\x80\x99 So they both went\r\nout upon the high road; but as the weather was warm, they had not gone\r\nfar before the dog said, \xe2\x80\x98I am very much tired--I should like to take a\r\nnap.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Very well,\xe2\x80\x99 answered the sparrow, \xe2\x80\x98do so, and in the meantime\r\nI will perch upon that bush.\xe2\x80\x99 So the dog stretched himself out on the\r\nroad, and fell fast asleep. Whilst he slept, there came by a carter with\r\na cart drawn by three horses, and loaded with two casks of wine. The\r\nsparrow, seeing that the carter did not turn out of the way, but would\r\ngo on in the track in which the dog lay, so as to drive over him, called\r\nout, \xe2\x80\x98Stop! stop! Mr Carter, or it shall be the worse for you.\xe2\x80\x99 But the\r\ncarter, grumbling to himself, \xe2\x80\x98You make it the worse for me, indeed!\r\nwhat can you do?\xe2\x80\x99 cracked his whip, and drove his cart over the poor\r\ndog, so that the wheels crushed him to death. \xe2\x80\x98There,\xe2\x80\x99 cried the\r\nsparrow, \xe2\x80\x98thou cruel villain, thou hast killed my friend the dog. Now\r\nmind what I say. This deed of thine shall cost thee all thou art worth.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do your worst, and welcome,\xe2\x80\x99 said the brute, \xe2\x80\x98what harm can you do me?\xe2\x80\x99\r\nand passed on. But the sparrow crept under the tilt of the cart, and\r\npecked at the bung of one of the casks till she loosened it; and then\r\nall the wine ran out, without the carter seeing it. At last he looked\r\nround, and saw that the cart was dripping, and the cask quite empty.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What an unlucky wretch I am!\xe2\x80\x99 cried he. \xe2\x80\x98Not wretch enough yet!\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nthe sparrow, as she alighted upon the head of one of the horses, and\r\npecked at him till he reared up and kicked. When the carter saw this,\r\nhe drew out his hatchet and aimed a blow at the sparrow, meaning to kill\r\nher; but she flew away, and the blow fell upon the poor horse\xe2\x80\x99s head\r\nwith such force, that he fell down dead. \xe2\x80\x98Unlucky wretch that I am!\xe2\x80\x99\r\ncried he. \xe2\x80\x98Not wretch enough yet!\xe2\x80\x99 said the sparrow. And as the carter\r\nwent on with the other two horses, she again crept under the tilt of the\r\ncart, and pecked out the bung of the second cask, so that all the wine\r\nran out. When the carter saw this, he again cried out, \xe2\x80\x98Miserable wretch\r\nthat I am!\xe2\x80\x99 But the sparrow answered, \xe2\x80\x98Not wretch enough yet!\xe2\x80\x99 and\r\nperched on the head of the second horse, and pecked at him too. The\r\ncarter ran up and struck at her again with his hatchet; but away she\r\nflew, and the blow fell upon the second horse and killed him on the\r\nspot. \xe2\x80\x98Unlucky wretch that I am!\xe2\x80\x99 said he. \xe2\x80\x98Not wretch enough yet!\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nthe sparrow; and perching upon the third horse, she began to peck him\r\ntoo. The carter was mad with fury; and without looking about him, or\r\ncaring what he was about, struck again at the sparrow; but killed his\r\nthird horse as he done the other two. \xe2\x80\x98Alas! miserable wretch that I\r\nam!\xe2\x80\x99 cried he. \xe2\x80\x98Not wretch enough yet!\xe2\x80\x99 answered the sparrow as she flew\r\naway; \xe2\x80\x98now will I plague and punish thee at thy own house.\xe2\x80\x99 The\r\ncarter was forced at last to leave his cart behind him, and to go home\r\noverflowing with rage and vexation. \xe2\x80\x98Alas!\xe2\x80\x99 said he to his wife, \xe2\x80\x98what\r\nill luck has befallen me!--my wine is all spilt, and my horses all three\r\ndead.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Alas! husband,\xe2\x80\x99 replied she, \xe2\x80\x98and a wicked bird has come into\r\nthe house, and has brought with her all the birds in the world, I am\r\nsure, and they have fallen upon our corn in the loft, and are eating it\r\nup at such a rate!\xe2\x80\x99 Away ran the husband upstairs, and saw thousands of\r\nbirds sitting upon the floor eating up his corn, with the sparrow in the\r\nmidst of them. \xe2\x80\x98Unlucky wretch that I am!\xe2\x80\x99 cried the carter; for he saw\r\nthat the corn was almost all gone. \xe2\x80\x98Not wretch enough yet!\xe2\x80\x99 said the\r\nsparrow; \xe2\x80\x98thy cruelty shall cost thee thy life yet!\xe2\x80\x99 and away she flew.\r\n\r\nThe carter seeing that he had thus lost all that he had, went down\r\ninto his kitchen; and was still not sorry for what he had done, but sat\r\nhimself angrily and sulkily in the chimney corner. But the sparrow sat\r\non the outside of the window, and cried \xe2\x80\x98Carter! thy cruelty shall cost\r\nthee thy life!\xe2\x80\x99 With that he jumped up in a rage, seized his hatchet,\r\nand threw it at the sparrow; but it missed her, and only broke the\r\nwindow. The sparrow now hopped in, perched upon the window-seat, and\r\ncried, \xe2\x80\x98Carter! it shall cost thee thy life!\xe2\x80\x99 Then he became mad and\r\nblind with rage, and struck the window-seat with such force that he\r\ncleft it in two: and as the sparrow flew from place to place, the carter\r\nand his wife were so furious, that they broke all their furniture,\r\nglasses, chairs, benches, the table, and at last the walls, without\r\ntouching the bird at all. In the end, however, they caught her: and the\r\nwife said, \xe2\x80\x98Shall I kill her at once?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98No,\xe2\x80\x99 cried he, \xe2\x80\x98that is letting\r\nher off too easily: she shall die a much more cruel death; I will eat\r\nher.\xe2\x80\x99 But the sparrow began to flutter about, and stretch out her neck\r\nand cried, \xe2\x80\x98Carter! it shall cost thee thy life yet!\xe2\x80\x99 With that he\r\ncould wait no longer: so he gave his wife the hatchet, and cried, \xe2\x80\x98Wife,\r\nstrike at the bird and kill her in my hand.\xe2\x80\x99 And the wife struck; but\r\nshe missed her aim, and hit her husband on the head so that he fell down\r\ndead, and the sparrow flew quietly home to her nest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TWELVE DANCING PRINCESSES\r\n\r\nThere was a king who had twelve beautiful daughters. They slept in\r\ntwelve beds all in one room; and when they went to bed, the doors were\r\nshut and locked up; but every morning their shoes were found to be quite\r\nworn through as if they had been danced in all night; and yet nobody\r\ncould find out how it happened, or where they had been.\r\n\r\nThen the king made it known to all the land, that if any person could\r\ndiscover the secret, and find out where it was that the princesses\r\ndanced in the night, he should have the one he liked best for his\r\nwife, and should be king after his death; but whoever tried and did not\r\nsucceed, after three days and nights, should be put to death.\r\n\r\nA king\xe2\x80\x99s son soon came. He was well entertained, and in the evening was\r\ntaken to the chamber next to the one where the princesses lay in their\r\ntwelve beds. There he was to sit and watch where they went to dance;\r\nand, in order that nothing might pass without his hearing it, the door\r\nof his chamber was left open. But the king\xe2\x80\x99s son soon fell asleep; and\r\nwhen he awoke in the morning he found that the princesses had all been\r\ndancing, for the soles of their shoes were full of holes. The same thing\r\nhappened the second and third night: so the king ordered his head to be\r\ncut off. After him came several others; but they had all the same luck,\r\nand all lost their lives in the same manner.\r\n\r\nNow it chanced that an old soldier, who had been wounded in battle\r\nand could fight no longer, passed through the country where this king\r\nreigned: and as he was travelling through a wood, he met an old woman,\r\nwho asked him where he was going. \xe2\x80\x98I hardly know where I am going, or\r\nwhat I had better do,\xe2\x80\x99 said the soldier; \xe2\x80\x98but I think I should like very\r\nwell to find out where it is that the princesses dance, and then in time\r\nI might be a king.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Well,\xe2\x80\x99 said the old dame, \xe2\x80\x98that is no very hard\r\ntask: only take care not to drink any of the wine which one of the\r\nprincesses will bring to you in the evening; and as soon as she leaves\r\nyou pretend to be fast asleep.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThen she gave him a cloak, and said, \xe2\x80\x98As soon as you put that on\r\nyou will become invisible, and you will then be able to follow the\r\nprincesses wherever they go.\xe2\x80\x99 When the soldier heard all this good\r\ncounsel, he determined to try his luck: so he went to the king, and said\r\nhe was willing to undertake the task.\r\n\r\nHe was as well received as the others had been, and the king ordered\r\nfine royal robes to be given him; and when the evening came he was led\r\nto the outer chamber. Just as he was going to lie down, the eldest of\r\nthe princesses brought him a cup of wine; but the soldier threw it all\r\naway secretly, taking care not to drink a drop. Then he laid himself\r\ndown on his bed, and in a little while began to snore very loud as if\r\nhe was fast asleep. When the twelve princesses heard this they laughed\r\nheartily; and the eldest said, \xe2\x80\x98This fellow too might have done a wiser\r\nthing than lose his life in this way!\xe2\x80\x99 Then they rose up and opened\r\ntheir drawers and boxes, and took out all their fine clothes, and\r\ndressed themselves at the glass, and skipped about as if they were eager\r\nto begin dancing. But the youngest said, \xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how it is, while\r\nyou are so happy I feel very uneasy; I am sure some mischance will\r\nbefall us.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98You simpleton,\xe2\x80\x99 said the eldest, \xe2\x80\x98you are always afraid;\r\nhave you forgotten how many kings\xe2\x80\x99 sons have already watched in vain?\r\nAnd as for this soldier, even if I had not given him his sleeping\r\ndraught, he would have slept soundly enough.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWhen they were all ready, they went and looked at the soldier; but he\r\nsnored on, and did not stir hand or foot: so they thought they were\r\nquite safe; and the eldest went up to her own bed and clapped her hands,\r\nand the bed sank into the floor and a trap-door flew open. The soldier\r\nsaw them going down through the trap-door one after another, the eldest\r\nleading the way; and thinking he had no time to lose, he jumped up, put\r\non the cloak which the old woman had given him, and followed them;\r\nbut in the middle of the stairs he trod on the gown of the youngest\r\nprincess, and she cried out to her sisters, \xe2\x80\x98All is not right; someone\r\ntook hold of my gown.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98You silly creature!\xe2\x80\x99 said the eldest, \xe2\x80\x98it is\r\nnothing but a nail in the wall.\xe2\x80\x99 Then down they all went, and at the\r\nbottom they found themselves in a most delightful grove of trees; and\r\nthe leaves were all of silver, and glittered and sparkled beautifully.\r\nThe soldier wished to take away some token of the place; so he broke\r\noff a little branch, and there came a loud noise from the tree. Then the\r\nyoungest daughter said again, \xe2\x80\x98I am sure all is not right--did not you\r\nhear that noise? That never happened before.\xe2\x80\x99 But the eldest said, \xe2\x80\x98It\r\nis only our princes, who are shouting for joy at our approach.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThen they came to another grove of trees, where all the leaves were of\r\ngold; and afterwards to a third, where the leaves were all glittering\r\ndiamonds. And the soldier broke a branch from each; and every time there\r\nwas a loud noise, which made the youngest sister tremble with fear; but\r\nthe eldest still said, it was only the princes, who were crying for joy.\r\nSo they went on till they came to a great lake; and at the side of the\r\nlake there lay twelve little boats with twelve handsome princes in them,\r\nwho seemed to be waiting there for the princesses.\r\n\r\nOne of the princesses went into each boat, and the soldier stepped into\r\nthe same boat with the youngest. As they were rowing over the lake, the\r\nprince who was in the boat with the youngest princess and the soldier\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x98I do not know why it is, but though I am rowing with all my might\r\nwe do not get on so fast as usual, and I am quite tired: the boat\r\nseems very heavy today.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98It is only the heat of the weather,\xe2\x80\x99 said the\r\nprincess: \xe2\x80\x98I feel it very warm too.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nOn the other side of the lake stood a fine illuminated castle, from\r\nwhich came the merry music of horns and trumpets. There they all landed,\r\nand went into the castle, and each prince danced with his princess; and\r\nthe soldier, who was all the time invisible, danced with them too; and\r\nwhen any of the princesses had a cup of wine set by her, he drank it\r\nall up, so that when she put the cup to her mouth it was empty. At this,\r\ntoo, the youngest sister was terribly frightened, but the eldest always\r\nsilenced her. They danced on till three o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the morning, and then\r\nall their shoes were worn out, so that they were obliged to leave off.\r\nThe princes rowed them back again over the lake (but this time the\r\nsoldier placed himself in the boat with the eldest princess); and on the\r\nopposite shore they took leave of each other, the princesses promising\r\nto come again the next night.\r\n\r\nWhen they came to the stairs, the soldier ran on before the princesses,\r\nand laid himself down; and as the twelve sisters slowly came up very\r\nmuch tired, they heard him snoring in his bed; so they said, \xe2\x80\x98Now all\r\nis quite safe\xe2\x80\x99; then they undressed themselves, put away their fine\r\nclothes, pulled off their shoes, and went to bed. In the morning the\r\nsoldier said nothing about what had happened, but determined to see more\r\nof this strange adventure, and went again the second and third night;\r\nand every thing happened just as before; the princesses danced each time\r\ntill their shoes were worn to pieces, and then returned home. However,\r\non the third night the soldier carried away one of the golden cups as a\r\ntoken of where he had been.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the time came when he was to declare the secret, he was taken\r\nbefore the king with the three branches and the golden cup; and the\r\ntwelve princesses stood listening behind the door to hear what he would\r\nsay. And when the king asked him. \xe2\x80\x98Where do my twelve daughters dance at\r\nnight?\xe2\x80\x99 he answered, \xe2\x80\x98With twelve princes in a castle under ground.\xe2\x80\x99 And\r\nthen he told the king all that had happened, and showed him the three\r\nbranches and the golden cup which he had brought with him. Then the king\r\ncalled for the princesses, and asked them whether what the soldier said\r\nwas true: and when they saw that they were discovered, and that it was\r\nof no use to deny what had happened, they confessed it all. And the king\r\nasked the soldier which of them he would choose for his wife; and he\r\nanswered, \xe2\x80\x98I am not very young, so I will have the eldest.\xe2\x80\x99--And they\r\nwere married that very day, and the soldier was chosen to be the king\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nheir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FISHERMAN AND HIS WIFE\r\n\r\nThere was once a fisherman who lived with his wife in a pigsty, close\r\nby the seaside. The fisherman used to go out all day long a-fishing; and\r\none day, as he sat on the shore with his rod, looking at the sparkling\r\nwaves and watching his line, all on a sudden his float was dragged away\r\ndeep into the water: and in drawing it up he pulled out a great fish.\r\nBut the fish said, \xe2\x80\x98Pray let me live! I am not a real fish; I am an\r\nenchanted prince: put me in the water again, and let me go!\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Oh, ho!\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsaid the man, \xe2\x80\x98you need not make so many words about the matter; I will\r\nhave nothing to do with a fish that can talk: so swim away, sir, as soon\r\nas you please!\xe2\x80\x99 Then he put him back into the water, and the fish darted\r\nstraight down to the bottom, and left a long streak of blood behind him\r\non the wave.\r\n\r\nWhen the fisherman went home to his wife in the pigsty, he told her how\r\nhe had caught a great fish, and how it had told him it was an enchanted\r\nprince, and how, on hearing it speak, he had let it go again. \xe2\x80\x98Did not\r\nyou ask it for anything?\xe2\x80\x99 said the wife, \xe2\x80\x98we live very wretchedly here,\r\nin this nasty dirty pigsty; do go back and tell the fish we want a snug\r\nlittle cottage.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe fisherman did not much like the business: however, he went to the\r\nseashore; and when he came back there the water looked all yellow and\r\ngreen. And he stood at the water\xe2\x80\x99s edge, and said:\r\n\r\n \xe2\x80\x98O man of the sea!\r\n  Hearken to me!\r\n  My wife Ilsabill\r\n  Will have her own will,\r\n  And hath sent me to beg a boon of thee!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThen the fish came swimming to him, and said, \xe2\x80\x98Well, what is her will?\r\nWhat does your wife want?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Ah!\xe2\x80\x99 said the fisherman, \xe2\x80\x98she says that when\r\nI had caught you, I ought to have asked you for something before I let\r\nyou go; she does not like living any longer in the pigsty, and wants\r\na snug little cottage.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Go home, then,\xe2\x80\x99 said the fish; \xe2\x80\x98she is in the\r\ncottage already!\xe2\x80\x99 So the man went home, and saw his wife standing at the\r\ndoor of a nice trim little cottage. \xe2\x80\x98Come in, come in!\xe2\x80\x99 said she; \xe2\x80\x98is\r\nnot this much better than the filthy pigsty we had?\xe2\x80\x99 And there was a\r\nparlour, and a bedchamber, and a kitchen; and behind the cottage there\r\nwas a little garden, planted with all sorts of flowers and fruits; and\r\nthere was a courtyard behind, full of ducks and chickens. \xe2\x80\x98Ah!\xe2\x80\x99 said the\r\nfisherman, \xe2\x80\x98how happily we shall live now!\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98We will try to do so, at\r\nleast,\xe2\x80\x99 said his wife.\r\n\r\nEverything went right for a week or two, and then Dame Ilsabill said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Husband, there is not near room enough for us in this cottage; the\r\ncourtyard and the garden are a great deal too small; I should like to\r\nhave a large stone castle to live in: go to the fish again and tell him\r\nto give us a castle.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Wife,\xe2\x80\x99 said the fisherman, \xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t like to go to\r\nhim again, for perhaps he will be angry; we ought to be easy with this\r\npretty cottage to live in.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Nonsense!\xe2\x80\x99 said the wife; \xe2\x80\x98he will do it\r\nvery willingly, I know; go along and try!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe fisherman went, but his heart was very heavy: and when he came to\r\nthe sea, it looked blue and gloomy, though it was very calm; and he went\r\nclose to the edge of the waves, and said:\r\n\r\n \xe2\x80\x98O man of the sea!\r\n  Hearken to me!\r\n  My wife Ilsabill\r\n  Will have her own will,\r\n  And hath sent me to beg a boon of thee!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, what does she want now?\xe2\x80\x99 said the fish. \xe2\x80\x98Ah!\xe2\x80\x99 said the man,\r\ndolefully, \xe2\x80\x98my wife wants to live in a stone castle.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Go home, then,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsaid the fish; \xe2\x80\x98she is standing at the gate of it already.\xe2\x80\x99 So away went\r\nthe fisherman, and found his wife standing before the gate of a great\r\ncastle. \xe2\x80\x98See,\xe2\x80\x99 said she, \xe2\x80\x98is not this grand?\xe2\x80\x99 With that they went into\r\nthe castle together, and found a great many servants there, and the\r\nrooms all richly furnished, and full of golden chairs and tables; and\r\nbehind the castle was a garden, and around it was a park half a\r\nmile long, full of sheep, and goats, and hares, and deer; and in the\r\ncourtyard were stables and cow-houses. \xe2\x80\x98Well,\xe2\x80\x99 said the man, \xe2\x80\x98now we\r\nwill live cheerful and happy in this beautiful castle for the rest of\r\nour lives.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Perhaps we may,\xe2\x80\x99 said the wife; \xe2\x80\x98but let us sleep upon it,\r\nbefore we make up our minds to that.\xe2\x80\x99 So they went to bed.\r\n\r\nThe next morning when Dame Ilsabill awoke it was broad daylight, and\r\nshe jogged the fisherman with her elbow, and said, \xe2\x80\x98Get up, husband,\r\nand bestir yourself, for we must be king of all the land.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Wife, wife,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsaid the man, \xe2\x80\x98why should we wish to be the king? I will not be king.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then I will,\xe2\x80\x99 said she. \xe2\x80\x98But, wife,\xe2\x80\x99 said the fisherman, \xe2\x80\x98how can you\r\nbe king--the fish cannot make you a king?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Husband,\xe2\x80\x99 said she, \xe2\x80\x98say\r\nno more about it, but go and try! I will be king.\xe2\x80\x99 So the man went away\r\nquite sorrowful to think that his wife should want to be king. This time\r\nthe sea looked a dark grey colour, and was overspread with curling waves\r\nand the ridges of foam as he cried out:\r\n\r\n \xe2\x80\x98O man of the sea!\r\n  Hearken to me!\r\n  My wife Ilsabill\r\n  Will have her own will,\r\n  And hath sent me to beg a boon of thee!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, what would she have now?\xe2\x80\x99 said the fish. \xe2\x80\x98Alas!\xe2\x80\x99 said the poor\r\nman, \xe2\x80\x98my wife wants to be king.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Go home,\xe2\x80\x99 said the fish; \xe2\x80\x98she is king\r\nalready.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThen the fisherman went home; and as he came close to the palace he saw\r\na troop of soldiers, and heard the sound of drums and trumpets. And when\r\nhe went in he saw his wife sitting on a throne of gold and diamonds,\r\nwith a golden crown upon her head; and on each side of her stood six\r\nfair maidens, each a head taller than the other. \xe2\x80\x98Well, wife,\xe2\x80\x99 said the\r\nfisherman, \xe2\x80\x98are you king?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Yes,\xe2\x80\x99 said she, \xe2\x80\x98I am king.\xe2\x80\x99 And when he had\r\nlooked at her for a long time, he said, \xe2\x80\x98Ah, wife! what a fine thing it\r\nis to be king! Now we shall never have anything more to wish for as long\r\nas we live.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how that may be,\xe2\x80\x99 said she; \xe2\x80\x98never is a long\r\ntime. I am king, it is true; but I begin to be tired of that, and I\r\nthink I should like to be emperor.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Alas, wife! why should you wish to\r\nbe emperor?\xe2\x80\x99 said the fisherman. \xe2\x80\x98Husband,\xe2\x80\x99 said she, \xe2\x80\x98go to the fish!\r\nI say I will be emperor.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Ah, wife!\xe2\x80\x99 replied the fisherman, \xe2\x80\x98the fish\r\ncannot make an emperor, I am sure, and I should not like to ask him for\r\nsuch a thing.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98I am king,\xe2\x80\x99 said Ilsabill, \xe2\x80\x98and you are my slave; so go\r\nat once!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSo the fisherman was forced to go; and he muttered as he went along,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98This will come to no good, it is too much to ask; the fish will be\r\ntired at last, and then we shall be sorry for what we have done.\xe2\x80\x99 He\r\nsoon came to the seashore; and the water was quite black and muddy, and\r\na mighty whirlwind blew over the waves and rolled them about, but he\r\nwent as near as he could to the water\xe2\x80\x99s brink, and said:\r\n\r\n \xe2\x80\x98O man of the sea!\r\n  Hearken to me!\r\n  My wife Ilsabill\r\n  Will have her own will,\r\n  And hath sent me to beg a boon of thee!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What would she have now?\xe2\x80\x99 said the fish. \xe2\x80\x98Ah!\xe2\x80\x99 said the fisherman,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98she wants to be emperor.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Go home,\xe2\x80\x99 said the fish; \xe2\x80\x98she is emperor\r\nalready.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSo he went home again; and as he came near he saw his wife Ilsabill\r\nsitting on a very lofty throne made of solid gold, with a great crown on\r\nher head full two yards high; and on each side of her stood her guards\r\nand attendants in a row, each one smaller than the other, from the\r\ntallest giant down to a little dwarf no bigger than my finger. And\r\nbefore her stood princes, and dukes, and earls: and the fisherman went\r\nup to her and said, \xe2\x80\x98Wife, are you emperor?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Yes,\xe2\x80\x99 said she, \xe2\x80\x98I am\r\nemperor.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Ah!\xe2\x80\x99 said the man, as he gazed upon her, \xe2\x80\x98what a fine thing\r\nit is to be emperor!\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Husband,\xe2\x80\x99 said she, \xe2\x80\x98why should we stop at being\r\nemperor? I will be pope next.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98O wife, wife!\xe2\x80\x99 said he, \xe2\x80\x98how can you be\r\npope? there is but one pope at a time in Christendom.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Husband,\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nshe, \xe2\x80\x98I will be pope this very day.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98But,\xe2\x80\x99 replied the husband, \xe2\x80\x98the\r\nfish cannot make you pope.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98What nonsense!\xe2\x80\x99 said she; \xe2\x80\x98if he can make\r\nan emperor, he can make a pope: go and try him.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSo the fisherman went. But when he came to the shore the wind was raging\r\nand the sea was tossed up and down in boiling waves, and the ships were\r\nin trouble, and rolled fearfully upon the tops of the billows. In the\r\nmiddle of the heavens there was a little piece of blue sky, but towards\r\nthe south all was red, as if a dreadful storm was rising. At this sight\r\nthe fisherman was dreadfully frightened, and he trembled so that his\r\nknees knocked together: but still he went down near to the shore, and\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n \xe2\x80\x98O man of the sea!\r\n  Hearken to me!\r\n  My wife Ilsabill\r\n  Will have her own will,\r\n  And hath sent me to beg a boon of thee!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What does she want now?\xe2\x80\x99 said the fish. \xe2\x80\x98Ah!\xe2\x80\x99 said the fisherman, \xe2\x80\x98my\r\nwife wants to be pope.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Go home,\xe2\x80\x99 said the fish; \xe2\x80\x98she is pope already.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThen the fisherman went home, and found Ilsabill sitting on a throne\r\nthat was two miles high. And she had three great crowns on her head, and\r\naround her stood all the pomp and power of the Church. And on each side\r\nof her were two rows of burning lights, of all sizes, the greatest as\r\nlarge as the highest and biggest tower in the world, and the least no\r\nlarger than a small rushlight. \xe2\x80\x98Wife,\xe2\x80\x99 said the fisherman, as he looked\r\nat all this greatness, \xe2\x80\x98are you pope?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Yes,\xe2\x80\x99 said she, \xe2\x80\x98I am pope.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, wife,\xe2\x80\x99 replied he, \xe2\x80\x98it is a grand thing to be pope; and now\r\nyou must be easy, for you can be nothing greater.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98I will think about\r\nthat,\xe2\x80\x99 said the wife. Then they went to bed: but Dame Ilsabill could not\r\nsleep all night for thinking what she should be next. At last, as she\r\nwas dropping asleep, morning broke, and the sun rose. \xe2\x80\x98Ha!\xe2\x80\x99 thought she,\r\nas she woke up and looked at it through the window, \xe2\x80\x98after all I cannot\r\nprevent the sun rising.\xe2\x80\x99 At this thought she was very angry, and wakened\r\nher husband, and said, \xe2\x80\x98Husband, go to the fish and tell him I must\r\nbe lord of the sun and moon.\xe2\x80\x99 The fisherman was half asleep, but the\r\nthought frightened him so much that he started and fell out of bed.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Alas, wife!\xe2\x80\x99 said he, \xe2\x80\x98cannot you be easy with being pope?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98No,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsaid she, \xe2\x80\x98I am very uneasy as long as the sun and moon rise without my\r\nleave. Go to the fish at once!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThen the man went shivering with fear; and as he was going down to\r\nthe shore a dreadful storm arose, so that the trees and the very rocks\r\nshook. And all the heavens became black with stormy clouds, and the\r\nlightnings played, and the thunders rolled; and you might have seen in\r\nthe sea great black waves, swelling up like mountains with crowns of\r\nwhite foam upon their heads. And the fisherman crept towards the sea,\r\nand cried out, as well as he could:\r\n\r\n \xe2\x80\x98O man of the sea!\r\n  Hearken to me!\r\n  My wife Ilsabill\r\n  Will have her own will,\r\n  And hath sent me to beg a boon of thee!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What does she want now?\xe2\x80\x99 said the fish. \xe2\x80\x98Ah!\xe2\x80\x99 said he, \xe2\x80\x98she wants to\r\nbe lord of the sun and moon.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Go home,\xe2\x80\x99 said the fish, \xe2\x80\x98to your pigsty\r\nagain.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAnd there they live to this very day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WILLOW-WREN AND THE BEAR\r\n\r\nOnce in summer-time the bear and the wolf were walking in the forest,\r\nand the bear heard a bird singing so beautifully that he said: \xe2\x80\x98Brother\r\nwolf, what bird is it that sings so well?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98That is the King of birds,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsaid the wolf, \xe2\x80\x98before whom we must bow down.\xe2\x80\x99 In reality the bird was\r\nthe willow-wren. \xe2\x80\x98IF that\xe2\x80\x99s the case,\xe2\x80\x99 said the bear, \xe2\x80\x98I should very\r\nmuch like to see his royal palace; come, take me thither.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98That is not\r\ndone quite as you seem to think,\xe2\x80\x99 said the wolf; \xe2\x80\x98you must wait until\r\nthe Queen comes,\xe2\x80\x99 Soon afterwards, the Queen arrived with some food in\r\nher beak, and the lord King came too, and they began to feed their young\r\nones. The bear would have liked to go at once, but the wolf held him\r\nback by the sleeve, and said: \xe2\x80\x98No, you must wait until the lord and lady\r\nQueen have gone away again.\xe2\x80\x99 So they took stock of the hole where the\r\nnest lay, and trotted away. The bear, however, could not rest until he\r\nhad seen the royal palace, and when a short time had passed, went to it\r\nagain. The King and Queen had just flown out, so he peeped in and saw\r\nfive or six young ones lying there. \xe2\x80\x98Is that the royal palace?\xe2\x80\x99 cried\r\nthe bear; \xe2\x80\x98it is a wretched palace, and you are not King\xe2\x80\x99s children, you\r\nare disreputable children!\xe2\x80\x99 When the young wrens heard that, they were\r\nfrightfully angry, and screamed: \xe2\x80\x98No, that we are not! Our parents are\r\nhonest people! Bear, you will have to pay for that!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe bear and the wolf grew uneasy, and turned back and went into their\r\nholes. The young willow-wrens, however, continued to cry and scream, and\r\nwhen their parents again brought food they said: \xe2\x80\x98We will not so much as\r\ntouch one fly\xe2\x80\x99s leg, no, not if we were dying of hunger, until you have\r\nsettled whether we are respectable children or not; the bear has been\r\nhere and has insulted us!\xe2\x80\x99 Then the old King said: \xe2\x80\x98Be easy, he shall\r\nbe punished,\xe2\x80\x99 and he at once flew with the Queen to the bear\xe2\x80\x99s cave, and\r\ncalled in: \xe2\x80\x98Old Growler, why have you insulted my children? You shall\r\nsuffer for it--we will punish you by a bloody war.\xe2\x80\x99 Thus war was\r\nannounced to the Bear, and all four-footed animals were summoned to take\r\npart in it, oxen, asses, cows, deer, and every other animal the earth\r\ncontained. And the willow-wren summoned everything which flew in the\r\nair, not only birds, large and small, but midges, and hornets, bees and\r\nflies had to come.\r\n\r\nWhen the time came for the war to begin, the willow-wren sent out spies\r\nto discover who was the enemy\xe2\x80\x99s commander-in-chief. The gnat, who was\r\nthe most crafty, flew into the forest where the enemy was assembled,\r\nand hid herself beneath a leaf of the tree where the password was to be\r\nannounced. There stood the bear, and he called the fox before him\r\nand said: \xe2\x80\x98Fox, you are the most cunning of all animals, you shall be\r\ngeneral and lead us.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Good,\xe2\x80\x99 said the fox, \xe2\x80\x98but what signal shall we\r\nagree upon?\xe2\x80\x99 No one knew that, so the fox said: \xe2\x80\x98I have a fine long\r\nbushy tail, which almost looks like a plume of red feathers. When I lift\r\nmy tail up quite high, all is going well, and you must charge; but if I\r\nlet it hang down, run away as fast as you can.\xe2\x80\x99 When the gnat had heard\r\nthat, she flew away again, and revealed everything, down to the minutest\r\ndetail, to the willow-wren. When day broke, and the battle was to begin,\r\nall the four-footed animals came running up with such a noise that the\r\nearth trembled. The willow-wren with his army also came flying through\r\nthe air with such a humming, and whirring, and swarming that every one\r\nwas uneasy and afraid, and on both sides they advanced against each\r\nother. But the willow-wren sent down the hornet, with orders to settle\r\nbeneath the fox\xe2\x80\x99s tail, and sting with all his might. When the fox felt\r\nthe first string, he started so that he lifted one leg, from pain, but\r\nhe bore it, and still kept his tail high in the air; at the second\r\nsting, he was forced to put it down for a moment; at the third, he could\r\nhold out no longer, screamed, and put his tail between his legs. When\r\nthe animals saw that, they thought all was lost, and began to flee, each\r\ninto his hole, and the birds had won the battle.\r\n\r\nThen the King and Queen flew home to their children and cried:\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Children, rejoice, eat and drink to your heart\xe2\x80\x99s content, we have won\r\nthe battle!\xe2\x80\x99 But the young wrens said: \xe2\x80\x98We will not eat yet, the bear\r\nmust come to the nest, and beg for pardon and say that we are honourable\r\nchildren, before we will do that.\xe2\x80\x99 Then the willow-wren flew to the\r\nbear\xe2\x80\x99s hole and cried: \xe2\x80\x98Growler, you are to come to the nest to my\r\nchildren, and beg their pardon, or else every rib of your body shall\r\nbe broken.\xe2\x80\x99 So the bear crept thither in the greatest fear, and begged\r\ntheir pardon. And now at last the young wrens were satisfied, and sat\r\ndown together and ate and drank, and made merry till quite late into the\r\nnight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FROG-PRINCE\r\n\r\nOne fine evening a young princess put on her bonnet and clogs, and went\r\nout to take a walk by herself in a wood; and when she came to a cool\r\nspring of water, that rose in the midst of it, she sat herself down\r\nto rest a while. Now she had a golden ball in her hand, which was her\r\nfavourite plaything; and she was always tossing it up into the air, and\r\ncatching it again as it fell. After a time she threw it up so high that\r\nshe missed catching it as it fell; and the ball bounded away, and rolled\r\nalong upon the ground, till at last it fell down into the spring. The\r\nprincess looked into the spring after her ball, but it was very deep, so\r\ndeep that she could not see the bottom of it. Then she began to bewail\r\nher loss, and said, \xe2\x80\x98Alas! if I could only get my ball again, I would\r\ngive all my fine clothes and jewels, and everything that I have in the\r\nworld.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWhilst she was speaking, a frog put its head out of the water, and said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Princess, why do you weep so bitterly?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Alas!\xe2\x80\x99 said she, \xe2\x80\x98what can you\r\ndo for me, you nasty frog? My golden ball has fallen into the spring.\xe2\x80\x99\r\nThe frog said, \xe2\x80\x98I want not your pearls, and jewels, and fine clothes;\r\nbut if you will love me, and let me live with you and eat from off\r\nyour golden plate, and sleep upon your bed, I will bring you your ball\r\nagain.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98What nonsense,\xe2\x80\x99 thought the princess, \xe2\x80\x98this silly frog is\r\ntalking! He can never even get out of the spring to visit me, though\r\nhe may be able to get my ball for me, and therefore I will tell him he\r\nshall have what he asks.\xe2\x80\x99 So she said to the frog, \xe2\x80\x98Well, if you will\r\nbring me my ball, I will do all you ask.\xe2\x80\x99 Then the frog put his head\r\ndown, and dived deep under the water; and after a little while he came\r\nup again, with the ball in his mouth, and threw it on the edge of the\r\nspring. As soon as the young princess saw her ball, she ran to pick\r\nit up; and she was so overjoyed to have it in her hand again, that she\r\nnever thought of the frog, but ran home with it as fast as she could.\r\nThe frog called after her, \xe2\x80\x98Stay, princess, and take me with you as you\r\nsaid,\xe2\x80\x99 But she did not stop to hear a word.\r\n\r\nThe next day, just as the princess had sat down to dinner, she heard a\r\nstrange noise--tap, tap--plash, plash--as if something was coming up the\r\nmarble staircase: and soon afterwards there was a gentle knock at the\r\ndoor, and a little voice cried out and said:\r\n\r\n \xe2\x80\x98Open the door, my princess dear,\r\n  Open the door to thy true love here!\r\n  And mind the words that thou and I said\r\n  By the fountain cool, in the greenwood shade.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThen the princess ran to the door and opened it, and there she saw\r\nthe frog, whom she had quite forgotten. At this sight she was sadly\r\nfrightened, and shutting the door as fast as she could came back to her\r\nseat. The king, her father, seeing that something had frightened her,\r\nasked her what was the matter. \xe2\x80\x98There is a nasty frog,\xe2\x80\x99 said she, \xe2\x80\x98at\r\nthe door, that lifted my ball for me out of the spring this morning: I\r\ntold him that he should live with me here, thinking that he could never\r\nget out of the spring; but there he is at the door, and he wants to come\r\nin.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWhile she was speaking the frog knocked again at the door, and said:\r\n\r\n \xe2\x80\x98Open the door, my princess dear,\r\n  Open the door to thy true love here!\r\n  And mind the words that thou and I said\r\n  By the fountain cool, in the greenwood shade.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThen the king said to the young princess, \xe2\x80\x98As you have given your word\r\nyou must keep it; so go and let him in.\xe2\x80\x99 She did so, and the frog hopped\r\ninto the room, and then straight on--tap, tap--plash, plash--from the\r\nbottom of the room to the top, till he came up close to the table where\r\nthe princess sat. \xe2\x80\x98Pray lift me upon chair,\xe2\x80\x99 said he to the princess,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98and let me sit next to you.\xe2\x80\x99 As soon as she had done this, the frog\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x98Put your plate nearer to me, that I may eat out of it.\xe2\x80\x99 This\r\nshe did, and when he had eaten as much as he could, he said, \xe2\x80\x98Now I am\r\ntired; carry me upstairs, and put me into your bed.\xe2\x80\x99 And the princess,\r\nthough very unwilling, took him up in her hand, and put him upon the\r\npillow of her own bed, where he slept all night long. As soon as it was\r\nlight he jumped up, hopped downstairs, and went out of the house.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now, then,\xe2\x80\x99 thought the princess, \xe2\x80\x98at last he is gone, and I shall be\r\ntroubled with him no more.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBut she was mistaken; for when night came again she heard the same\r\ntapping at the door; and the frog came once more, and said:\r\n\r\n \xe2\x80\x98Open the door, my princess dear,\r\n  Open the door to thy true love here!\r\n  And mind the words that thou and I said\r\n  By the fountain cool, in the greenwood shade.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAnd when the princess opened the door the frog came in, and slept upon\r\nher pillow as before, till the morning broke. And the third night he did\r\nthe same. But when the princess awoke on the following morning she was\r\nastonished to see, instead of the frog, a handsome prince, gazing on her\r\nwith the most beautiful eyes she had ever seen, and standing at the head\r\nof her bed.\r\n\r\nHe told her that he had been enchanted by a spiteful fairy, who had\r\nchanged him into a frog; and that he had been fated so to abide till\r\nsome princess should take him out of the spring, and let him eat from\r\nher plate, and sleep upon her bed for three nights. \xe2\x80\x98You,\xe2\x80\x99 said the\r\nprince, \xe2\x80\x98have broken his cruel charm, and now I have nothing to wish for\r\nbut that you should go with me into my father\xe2\x80\x99s kingdom, where I will\r\nmarry you, and love you as long as you live.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe young princess, you may be sure, was not long in saying \xe2\x80\x98Yes\xe2\x80\x99 to\r\nall this; and as they spoke a gay coach drove up, with eight beautiful\r\nhorses, decked with plumes of feathers and a golden harness; and behind\r\nthe coach rode the prince\xe2\x80\x99s servant, faithful Heinrich, who had bewailed\r\nthe misfortunes of his dear master during his enchantment so long and so\r\nbitterly, that his heart had well-nigh burst.\r\n\r\nThey then took leave of the king, and got into the coach with eight\r\nhorses, and all set out, full of joy and merriment, for the prince\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nkingdom, which they reached safely; and there they lived happily a great\r\nmany years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCAT AND MOUSE IN PARTNERSHIP\r\n\r\nA certain cat had made the acquaintance of a mouse, and had said so much\r\nto her about the great love and friendship she felt for her, that at\r\nlength the mouse agreed that they should live and keep house together.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But we must make a provision for winter, or else we shall suffer\r\nfrom hunger,\xe2\x80\x99 said the cat; \xe2\x80\x98and you, little mouse, cannot venture\r\neverywhere, or you will be caught in a trap some day.\xe2\x80\x99 The good advice\r\nwas followed, and a pot of fat was bought, but they did not know where\r\nto put it. At length, after much consideration, the cat said: \xe2\x80\x98I know no\r\nplace where it will be better stored up than in the church, for no one\r\ndares take anything away from there. We will set it beneath the altar,\r\nand not touch it until we are really in need of it.\xe2\x80\x99 So the pot was\r\nplaced in safety, but it was not long before the cat had a great\r\nyearning for it, and said to the mouse: \xe2\x80\x98I want to tell you something,\r\nlittle mouse; my cousin has brought a little son into the world, and has\r\nasked me to be godmother; he is white with brown spots, and I am to hold\r\nhim over the font at the christening. Let me go out today, and you look\r\nafter the house by yourself.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Yes, yes,\xe2\x80\x99 answered the mouse, \xe2\x80\x98by all\r\nmeans go, and if you get anything very good to eat, think of me. I\r\nshould like a drop of sweet red christening wine myself.\xe2\x80\x99 All this,\r\nhowever, was untrue; the cat had no cousin, and had not been asked to\r\nbe godmother. She went straight to the church, stole to the pot of fat,\r\nbegan to lick at it, and licked the top of the fat off. Then she took a\r\nwalk upon the roofs of the town, looked out for opportunities, and then\r\nstretched herself in the sun, and licked her lips whenever she thought\r\nof the pot of fat, and not until it was evening did she return home.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, here you are again,\xe2\x80\x99 said the mouse, \xe2\x80\x98no doubt you have had a\r\nmerry day.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98All went off well,\xe2\x80\x99 answered the cat. \xe2\x80\x98What name did they\r\ngive the child?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Top off!\xe2\x80\x99 said the cat quite coolly. \xe2\x80\x98Top off!\xe2\x80\x99 cried\r\nthe mouse, \xe2\x80\x98that is a very odd and uncommon name, is it a usual one in\r\nyour family?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98What does that matter,\xe2\x80\x99 said the cat, \xe2\x80\x98it is no worse\r\nthan Crumb-stealer, as your godchildren are called.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBefore long the cat was seized by another fit of yearning. She said to\r\nthe mouse: \xe2\x80\x98You must do me a favour, and once more manage the house for\r\na day alone. I am again asked to be godmother, and, as the child has a\r\nwhite ring round its neck, I cannot refuse.\xe2\x80\x99 The good mouse consented,\r\nbut the cat crept behind the town walls to the church, and devoured\r\nhalf the pot of fat. \xe2\x80\x98Nothing ever seems so good as what one keeps to\r\noneself,\xe2\x80\x99 said she, and was quite satisfied with her day\xe2\x80\x99s work. When\r\nshe went home the mouse inquired: \xe2\x80\x98And what was the child christened?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Half-done,\xe2\x80\x99 answered the cat. \xe2\x80\x98Half-done! What are you saying? I\r\nnever heard the name in my life, I\xe2\x80\x99ll wager anything it is not in the\r\ncalendar!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe cat\xe2\x80\x99s mouth soon began to water for some more licking. \xe2\x80\x98All good\r\nthings go in threes,\xe2\x80\x99 said she, \xe2\x80\x98I am asked to stand godmother again.\r\nThe child is quite black, only it has white paws, but with that\r\nexception, it has not a single white hair on its whole body; this only\r\nhappens once every few years, you will let me go, won\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Top-off!\r\nHalf-done!\xe2\x80\x99 answered the mouse, \xe2\x80\x98they are such odd names, they make me\r\nvery thoughtful.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98You sit at home,\xe2\x80\x99 said the cat, \xe2\x80\x98in your dark-grey\r\nfur coat and long tail, and are filled with fancies, that\xe2\x80\x99s because\r\nyou do not go out in the daytime.\xe2\x80\x99 During the cat\xe2\x80\x99s absence the mouse\r\ncleaned the house, and put it in order, but the greedy cat entirely\r\nemptied the pot of fat. \xe2\x80\x98When everything is eaten up one has some\r\npeace,\xe2\x80\x99 said she to herself, and well filled and fat she did not return\r\nhome till night. The mouse at once asked what name had been given to\r\nthe third child. \xe2\x80\x98It will not please you more than the others,\xe2\x80\x99 said the\r\ncat. \xe2\x80\x98He is called All-gone.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98All-gone,\xe2\x80\x99 cried the mouse \xe2\x80\x98that is the\r\nmost suspicious name of all! I have never seen it in print. All-gone;\r\nwhat can that mean?\xe2\x80\x99 and she shook her head, curled herself up, and lay\r\ndown to sleep.\r\n\r\nFrom this time forth no one invited the cat to be godmother, but\r\nwhen the winter had come and there was no longer anything to be found\r\noutside, the mouse thought of their provision, and said: \xe2\x80\x98Come, cat,\r\nwe will go to our pot of fat which we have stored up for ourselves--we\r\nshall enjoy that.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Yes,\xe2\x80\x99 answered the cat, \xe2\x80\x98you will enjoy it as much\r\nas you would enjoy sticking that dainty tongue of yours out of the\r\nwindow.\xe2\x80\x99 They set out on their way, but when they arrived, the pot of\r\nfat certainly was still in its place, but it was empty. \xe2\x80\x98Alas!\xe2\x80\x99 said the\r\nmouse, \xe2\x80\x98now I see what has happened, now it comes to light! You are a true\r\nfriend! You have devoured all when you were standing godmother. First\r\ntop off, then half-done, then--\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Will you hold your tongue,\xe2\x80\x99 cried the\r\ncat, \xe2\x80\x98one word more, and I will eat you too.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98All-gone\xe2\x80\x99 was already on\r\nthe poor mouse\xe2\x80\x99s lips; scarcely had she spoken it before the cat sprang\r\non her, seized her, and swallowed her down. Verily, that is the way of\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GOOSE-GIRL\r\n\r\nThe king of a great land died, and left his queen to take care of their\r\nonly child. This child was a daughter, who was very beautiful; and her\r\nmother loved her dearly, and was very kind to her. And there was a good\r\nfairy too, who was fond of the princess, and helped her mother to watch\r\nover her. When she grew up, she was betrothed to a prince who lived a\r\ngreat way off; and as the time drew near for her to be married, she\r\ngot ready to set off on her journey to his country. Then the queen her\r\nmother, packed up a great many costly things; jewels, and gold, and\r\nsilver; trinkets, fine dresses, and in short everything that became a\r\nroyal bride. And she gave her a waiting-maid to ride with her, and give\r\nher into the bridegroom\xe2\x80\x99s hands; and each had a horse for the journey.\r\nNow the princess\xe2\x80\x99s horse was the fairy\xe2\x80\x99s gift, and it was called Falada,\r\nand could speak.\r\n\r\nWhen the time came for them to set out, the fairy went into her\r\nbed-chamber, and took a little knife, and cut off a lock of her hair,\r\nand gave it to the princess, and said, \xe2\x80\x98Take care of it, dear child; for\r\nit is a charm that may be of use to you on the road.\xe2\x80\x99 Then they all took\r\na sorrowful leave of the princess; and she put the lock of hair into\r\nher bosom, got upon her horse, and set off on her journey to her\r\nbridegroom\xe2\x80\x99s kingdom.\r\n\r\nOne day, as they were riding along by a brook, the princess began to\r\nfeel very thirsty: and she said to her maid, \xe2\x80\x98Pray get down, and fetch\r\nme some water in my golden cup out of yonder brook, for I want to\r\ndrink.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Nay,\xe2\x80\x99 said the maid, \xe2\x80\x98if you are thirsty, get off yourself, and\r\nstoop down by the water and drink; I shall not be your waiting-maid any\r\nlonger.\xe2\x80\x99 Then she was so thirsty that she got down, and knelt over the\r\nlittle brook, and drank; for she was frightened, and dared not bring out\r\nher golden cup; and she wept and said, \xe2\x80\x98Alas! what will become of me?\xe2\x80\x99\r\nAnd the lock answered her, and said:\r\n\r\n \xe2\x80\x98Alas! alas! if thy mother knew it,\r\n  Sadly, sadly, would she rue it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBut the princess was very gentle and meek, so she said nothing to her\r\nmaid\xe2\x80\x99s ill behaviour, but got upon her horse again.\r\n\r\nThen all rode farther on their journey, till the day grew so warm, and\r\nthe sun so scorching, that the bride began to feel very thirsty again;\r\nand at last, when they came to a river, she forgot her maid\xe2\x80\x99s rude\r\nspeech, and said, \xe2\x80\x98Pray get down, and fetch me some water to drink in\r\nmy golden cup.\xe2\x80\x99 But the maid answered her, and even spoke more haughtily\r\nthan before: \xe2\x80\x98Drink if you will, but I shall not be your waiting-maid.\xe2\x80\x99\r\nThen the princess was so thirsty that she got off her horse, and lay\r\ndown, and held her head over the running stream, and cried and said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What will become of me?\xe2\x80\x99 And the lock of hair answered her again:\r\n\r\n \xe2\x80\x98Alas! alas! if thy mother knew it,\r\n  Sadly, sadly, would she rue it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAnd as she leaned down to drink, the lock of hair fell from her bosom,\r\nand floated away with the water. Now she was so frightened that she did\r\nnot see it; but her maid saw it, and was very glad, for she knew the\r\ncharm; and she saw that the poor bride would be in her power, now that\r\nshe had lost the hair. So when the bride had done drinking, and would\r\nhave got upon Falada again, the maid said, \xe2\x80\x98I shall ride upon Falada,\r\nand you may have my horse instead\xe2\x80\x99; so she was forced to give up her\r\nhorse, and soon afterwards to take off her royal clothes and put on her\r\nmaid\xe2\x80\x99s shabby ones.\r\n\r\nAt last, as they drew near the end of their journey, this treacherous\r\nservant threatened to kill her mistress if she ever told anyone what had\r\nhappened. But Falada saw it all, and marked it well.\r\n\r\nThen the waiting-maid got upon Falada, and the real bride rode upon the\r\nother horse, and they went on in this way till at last they came to the\r\nroyal court. There was great joy at their coming, and the prince flew to\r\nmeet them, and lifted the maid from her horse, thinking she was the one\r\nwho was to be his wife; and she was led upstairs to the royal chamber;\r\nbut the true princess was told to stay in the court below.\r\n\r\nNow the old king happened just then to have nothing else to do; so he\r\namused himself by sitting at his kitchen window, looking at what was\r\ngoing on; and he saw her in the courtyard. As she looked very pretty,\r\nand too delicate for a waiting-maid, he went up into the royal chamber\r\nto ask the bride who it was she had brought with her, that was thus left\r\nstanding in the court below. \xe2\x80\x98I brought her with me for the sake of her\r\ncompany on the road,\xe2\x80\x99 said she; \xe2\x80\x98pray give the girl some work to do,\r\nthat she may not be idle.\xe2\x80\x99 The old king could not for some time think\r\nof any work for her to do; but at last he said, \xe2\x80\x98I have a lad who takes\r\ncare of my geese; she may go and help him.\xe2\x80\x99 Now the name of this lad,\r\nthat the real bride was to help in watching the king\xe2\x80\x99s geese, was\r\nCurdken.\r\n\r\nBut the false bride said to the prince, \xe2\x80\x98Dear husband, pray do me one\r\npiece of kindness.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98That I will,\xe2\x80\x99 said the prince. \xe2\x80\x98Then tell one of\r\nyour slaughterers to cut off the head of the horse I rode upon, for it\r\nwas very unruly, and plagued me sadly on the road\xe2\x80\x99; but the truth was,\r\nshe was very much afraid lest Falada should some day or other speak, and\r\ntell all she had done to the princess. She carried her point, and the\r\nfaithful Falada was killed; but when the true princess heard of it, she\r\nwept, and begged the man to nail up Falada\xe2\x80\x99s head against a large\r\ndark gate of the city, through which she had to pass every morning\r\nand evening, that there she might still see him sometimes. Then the\r\nslaughterer said he would do as she wished; and cut off the head, and\r\nnailed it up under the dark gate.\r\n\r\nEarly the next morning, as she and Curdken went out through the gate,\r\nshe said sorrowfully:\r\n\r\n \xe2\x80\x98Falada, Falada, there thou hangest!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nand the head answered:\r\n\r\n \xe2\x80\x98Bride, bride, there thou gangest!\r\n  Alas! alas! if thy mother knew it,\r\n  Sadly, sadly, would she rue it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThen they went out of the city, and drove the geese on. And when she\r\ncame to the meadow, she sat down upon a bank there, and let down her\r\nwaving locks of hair, which were all of pure silver; and when Curdken\r\nsaw it glitter in the sun, he ran up, and would have pulled some of the\r\nlocks out, but she cried:\r\n\r\n \xe2\x80\x98Blow, breezes, blow!\r\n  Let Curdken\xe2\x80\x99s hat go!\r\n  Blow, breezes, blow!\r\n  Let him after it go!\r\n  O\xe2\x80\x99er hills, dales, and rocks,\r\n  Away be it whirl\xe2\x80\x99d\r\n  Till the silvery locks\r\n  Are all comb\xe2\x80\x99d and curl\xe2\x80\x99d!\r\n\r\nThen there came a wind, so strong that it blew off Curdken\xe2\x80\x99s hat; and\r\naway it flew over the hills: and he was forced to turn and run after\r\nit; till, by the time he came back, she had done combing and curling her\r\nhair, and had put it up again safe. Then he was very angry and sulky,\r\nand would not speak to her at all; but they watched the geese until it\r\ngrew dark in the evening, and then drove them homewards.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, as they were going through the dark gate, the poor\r\ngirl looked up at Falada\xe2\x80\x99s head, and cried:\r\n\r\n \xe2\x80\x98Falada, Falada, there thou hangest!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nand the head answered:\r\n\r\n \xe2\x80\x98Bride, bride, there thou gangest!\r\n  Alas! alas! if thy mother knew it,\r\n  Sadly, sadly, would she rue it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThen she drove on the geese, and sat down again in the meadow, and began\r\nto comb out her hair as before; and Curdken ran up to her, and wanted to\r\ntake hold of it; but she cried out quickly:\r\n\r\n \xe2\x80\x98Blow, breezes, blow!\r\n  Let Curdken\xe2\x80\x99s hat go!\r\n  Blow, breezes, blow!\r\n  Let him after it go!\r\n  O\xe2\x80\x99er hills, dales, and rocks,\r\n  Away be it whirl\xe2\x80\x99d\r\n  Till the silvery locks\r\n  Are all comb\xe2\x80\x99d and curl\xe2\x80\x99d!\r\n\r\nThen the wind came and blew away his hat; and off it flew a great way,\r\nover the hills and far away, so that he had to run after it; and when\r\nhe came back she had bound up her hair again, and all was safe. So they\r\nwatched the geese till it grew dark.\r\n\r\nIn the evening, after they came home, Curdken went to the old king, and\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x98I cannot have that strange girl to help me to keep the geese any\r\nlonger.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Why?\xe2\x80\x99 said the king. \xe2\x80\x98Because, instead of doing any good, she\r\ndoes nothing but tease me all day long.\xe2\x80\x99 Then the king made him tell him\r\nwhat had happened. And Curdken said, \xe2\x80\x98When we go in the morning through\r\nthe dark gate with our flock of geese, she cries and talks with the head\r\nof a horse that hangs upon the wall, and says:\r\n\r\n \xe2\x80\x98Falada, Falada, there thou hangest!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nand the head answers:\r\n\r\n \xe2\x80\x98Bride, bride, there thou gangest!\r\n  Alas! alas! if thy mother knew it,\r\n  Sadly, sadly, would she rue it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAnd Curdken went on telling the king what had happened upon the meadow\r\nwhere the geese fed; how his hat was blown away; and how he was forced\r\nto run after it, and to leave his flock of geese to themselves. But the\r\nold king told the boy to go out again the next day: and when morning\r\ncame, he placed himself behind the dark gate, and heard how she spoke\r\nto Falada, and how Falada answered. Then he went into the field, and\r\nhid himself in a bush by the meadow\xe2\x80\x99s side; and he soon saw with his own\r\neyes how they drove the flock of geese; and how, after a little time,\r\nshe let down her hair that glittered in the sun. And then he heard her\r\nsay:\r\n\r\n \xe2\x80\x98Blow, breezes, blow!\r\n  Let Curdken\xe2\x80\x99s hat go!\r\n  Blow, breezes, blow!\r\n  Let him after it go!\r\n  O\xe2\x80\x99er hills, dales, and rocks,\r\n  Away be it whirl\xe2\x80\x99d\r\n  Till the silvery locks\r\n  Are all comb\xe2\x80\x99d and curl\xe2\x80\x99d!\r\n\r\nAnd soon came a gale of wind, and carried away Curdken\xe2\x80\x99s hat, and away\r\nwent Curdken after it, while the girl went on combing and curling her\r\nhair. All this the old king saw: so he went home without being seen; and\r\nwhen the little goose-girl came back in the evening he called her aside,\r\nand asked her why she did so: but she burst into tears, and said, \xe2\x80\x98That\r\nI must not tell you or any man, or I shall lose my life.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBut the old king begged so hard, that she had no peace till she had told\r\nhim all the tale, from beginning to end, word for word. And it was very\r\nlucky for her that she did so, for when she had done the king ordered\r\nroyal clothes to be put upon her, and gazed on her with wonder, she was\r\nso beautiful. Then he called his son and told him that he had only a\r\nfalse bride; for that she was merely a waiting-maid, while the true\r\nbride stood by. And the young king rejoiced when he saw her beauty, and\r\nheard how meek and patient she had been; and without saying anything to\r\nthe false bride, the king ordered a great feast to be got ready for all\r\nhis court. The bridegroom sat at the top, with the false princess on one\r\nside, and the true one on the other; but nobody knew her again, for her\r\nbeauty was quite dazzling to their eyes; and she did not seem at all\r\nlike the little goose-girl, now that she had her brilliant dress on.\r\n\r\nWhen they had eaten and drank, and were very merry, the old king said\r\nhe would tell them a tale. So he began, and told all the story of the\r\nprincess, as if it was one that he had once heard; and he asked the\r\ntrue waiting-maid what she thought ought to be done to anyone who would\r\nbehave thus. \xe2\x80\x98Nothing better,\xe2\x80\x99 said this false bride, \xe2\x80\x98than that she\r\nshould be thrown into a cask stuck round with sharp nails, and that\r\ntwo white horses should be put to it, and should drag it from street to\r\nstreet till she was dead.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Thou art she!\xe2\x80\x99 said the old king; \xe2\x80\x98and as\r\nthou has judged thyself, so shall it be done to thee.\xe2\x80\x99 And the young\r\nking was then married to his true wife, and they reigned over the\r\nkingdom in peace and happiness all their lives; and the good fairy came\r\nto see them, and restored the faithful Falada to life again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ADVENTURES OF CHANTICLEER AND PARTLET\r\n\r\n\r\n1. HOW THEY WENT TO THE MOUNTAINS TO EAT NUTS\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The nuts are quite ripe now,\xe2\x80\x99 said Chanticleer to his wife Partlet,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98suppose we go together to the mountains, and eat as many as we can,\r\nbefore the squirrel takes them all away.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98With all my heart,\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nPartlet, \xe2\x80\x98let us go and make a holiday of it together.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSo they went to the mountains; and as it was a lovely day, they stayed\r\nthere till the evening. Now, whether it was that they had eaten so many\r\nnuts that they could not walk, or whether they were lazy and would not,\r\nI do not know: however, they took it into their heads that it did not\r\nbecome them to go home on foot. So Chanticleer began to build a little\r\ncarriage of nutshells: and when it was finished, Partlet jumped into\r\nit and sat down, and bid Chanticleer harness himself to it and draw her\r\nhome. \xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s a good joke!\xe2\x80\x99 said Chanticleer; \xe2\x80\x98no, that will never do;\r\nI had rather by half walk home; I\xe2\x80\x99ll sit on the box and be coachman,\r\nif you like, but I\xe2\x80\x99ll not draw.\xe2\x80\x99 While this was passing, a duck came\r\nquacking up and cried out, \xe2\x80\x98You thieving vagabonds, what business have\r\nyou in my grounds? I\xe2\x80\x99ll give it you well for your insolence!\xe2\x80\x99 and upon\r\nthat she fell upon Chanticleer most lustily. But Chanticleer was no\r\ncoward, and returned the duck\xe2\x80\x99s blows with his sharp spurs so fiercely\r\nthat she soon began to cry out for mercy; which was only granted her\r\nupon condition that she would draw the carriage home for them. This she\r\nagreed to do; and Chanticleer got upon the box, and drove, crying, \xe2\x80\x98Now,\r\nduck, get on as fast as you can.\xe2\x80\x99 And away they went at a pretty good\r\npace.\r\n\r\nAfter they had travelled along a little way, they met a needle and a pin\r\nwalking together along the road: and the needle cried out, \xe2\x80\x98Stop, stop!\xe2\x80\x99\r\nand said it was so dark that they could hardly find their way, and such\r\ndirty walking they could not get on at all: he told them that he and his\r\nfriend, the pin, had been at a public-house a few miles off, and had sat\r\ndrinking till they had forgotten how late it was; he begged therefore\r\nthat the travellers would be so kind as to give them a lift in their\r\ncarriage. Chanticleer observing that they were but thin fellows, and not\r\nlikely to take up much room, told them they might ride, but made them\r\npromise not to dirty the wheels of the carriage in getting in, nor to\r\ntread on Partlet\xe2\x80\x99s toes.\r\n\r\nLate at night they arrived at an inn; and as it was bad travelling in\r\nthe dark, and the duck seemed much tired, and waddled about a good\r\ndeal from one side to the other, they made up their minds to fix their\r\nquarters there: but the landlord at first was unwilling, and said his\r\nhouse was full, thinking they might not be very respectable company:\r\nhowever, they spoke civilly to him, and gave him the egg which Partlet\r\nhad laid by the way, and said they would give him the duck, who was in\r\nthe habit of laying one every day: so at last he let them come in, and\r\nthey bespoke a handsome supper, and spent the evening very jollily.\r\n\r\nEarly in the morning, before it was quite light, and when nobody was\r\nstirring in the inn, Chanticleer awakened his wife, and, fetching the\r\negg, they pecked a hole in it, ate it up, and threw the shells into the\r\nfireplace: they then went to the pin and needle, who were fast asleep,\r\nand seizing them by the heads, stuck one into the landlord\xe2\x80\x99s easy chair\r\nand the other into his handkerchief; and, having done this, they crept\r\naway as softly as possible. However, the duck, who slept in the open\r\nair in the yard, heard them coming, and jumping into the brook which ran\r\nclose by the inn, soon swam out of their reach.\r\n\r\nAn hour or two afterwards the landlord got up, and took his handkerchief\r\nto wipe his face, but the pin ran into him and pricked him: then he\r\nwalked into the kitchen to light his pipe at the fire, but when he\r\nstirred it up the eggshells flew into his eyes, and almost blinded him.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Bless me!\xe2\x80\x99 said he, \xe2\x80\x98all the world seems to have a design against my\r\nhead this morning\xe2\x80\x99: and so saying, he threw himself sulkily into his\r\neasy chair; but, oh dear! the needle ran into him; and this time the\r\npain was not in his head. He now flew into a very great passion, and,\r\nsuspecting the company who had come in the night before, he went to look\r\nafter them, but they were all off; so he swore that he never again\r\nwould take in such a troop of vagabonds, who ate a great deal, paid no\r\nreckoning, and gave him nothing for his trouble but their apish tricks.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. HOW CHANTICLEER AND PARTLET WENT TO VISIT MR KORBES\r\n\r\nAnother day, Chanticleer and Partlet wished to ride out together;\r\nso Chanticleer built a handsome carriage with four red wheels, and\r\nharnessed six mice to it; and then he and Partlet got into the carriage,\r\nand away they drove. Soon afterwards a cat met them, and said, \xe2\x80\x98Where\r\nare you going?\xe2\x80\x99 And Chanticleer replied,\r\n\r\n \xe2\x80\x98All on our way\r\n  A visit to pay\r\n  To Mr Korbes, the fox, today.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThen the cat said, \xe2\x80\x98Take me with you,\xe2\x80\x99 Chanticleer said, \xe2\x80\x98With all my\r\nheart: get up behind, and be sure you do not fall off.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n \xe2\x80\x98Take care of this handsome coach of mine,\r\n  Nor dirty my pretty red wheels so fine!\r\n  Now, mice, be ready,\r\n  And, wheels, run steady!\r\n  For we are going a visit to pay\r\n  To Mr Korbes, the fox, today.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSoon after came up a millstone, an egg, a duck, and a pin; and\r\nChanticleer gave them all leave to get into the carriage and go with\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nWhen they arrived at Mr Korbes\xe2\x80\x99s house, he was not at home; so the mice\r\ndrew the carriage into the coach-house, Chanticleer and Partlet flew\r\nupon a beam, the cat sat down in the fireplace, the duck got into\r\nthe washing cistern, the pin stuck himself into the bed pillow, the\r\nmillstone laid himself over the house door, and the egg rolled himself\r\nup in the towel.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr Korbes came home, he went to the fireplace to make a fire; but\r\nthe cat threw all the ashes in his eyes: so he ran to the kitchen to\r\nwash himself; but there the duck splashed all the water in his face; and\r\nwhen he tried to wipe himself, the egg broke to pieces in the towel all\r\nover his face and eyes. Then he was very angry, and went without his\r\nsupper to bed; but when he laid his head on the pillow, the pin ran into\r\nhis cheek: at this he became quite furious, and, jumping up, would have\r\nrun out of the house; but when he came to the door, the millstone fell\r\ndown on his head, and killed him on the spot.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. HOW PARTLET DIED AND WAS BURIED, AND HOW CHANTICLEER DIED OF GRIEF\r\n\r\nAnother day Chanticleer and Partlet agreed to go again to the mountains\r\nto eat nuts; and it was settled that all the nuts which they found\r\nshould be shared equally between them. Now Partlet found a very large\r\nnut; but she said nothing about it to Chanticleer, and kept it all to\r\nherself: however, it was so big that she could not swallow it, and it\r\nstuck in her throat. Then she was in a great fright, and cried out to\r\nChanticleer, \xe2\x80\x98Pray run as fast as you can, and fetch me some water, or I\r\nshall be choked.\xe2\x80\x99 Chanticleer ran as fast as he could to the river, and\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x98River, give me some water, for Partlet lies in the mountain, and\r\nwill be choked by a great nut.\xe2\x80\x99 The river said, \xe2\x80\x98Run first to the bride,\r\nand ask her for a silken cord to draw up the water.\xe2\x80\x99 Chanticleer ran to\r\nthe bride, and said, \xe2\x80\x98Bride, you must give me a silken cord, for then\r\nthe river will give me water, and the water I will carry to Partlet, who\r\nlies on the mountain, and will be choked by a great nut.\xe2\x80\x99 But the bride\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x98Run first, and bring me my garland that is hanging on a willow\r\nin the garden.\xe2\x80\x99 Then Chanticleer ran to the garden, and took the garland\r\nfrom the bough where it hung, and brought it to the bride; and then\r\nthe bride gave him the silken cord, and he took the silken cord to\r\nthe river, and the river gave him water, and he carried the water to\r\nPartlet; but in the meantime she was choked by the great nut, and lay\r\nquite dead, and never moved any more.\r\n\r\nThen Chanticleer was very sorry, and cried bitterly; and all the beasts\r\ncame and wept with him over poor Partlet. And six mice built a little\r\nhearse to carry her to her grave; and when it was ready they harnessed\r\nthemselves before it, and Chanticleer drove them. On the way they\r\nmet the fox. \xe2\x80\x98Where are you going, Chanticleer?\xe2\x80\x99 said he. \xe2\x80\x98To bury my\r\nPartlet,\xe2\x80\x99 said the other. \xe2\x80\x98May I go with you?\xe2\x80\x99 said the fox. \xe2\x80\x98Yes; but\r\nyou must get up behind, or my horses will not be able to draw you.\xe2\x80\x99 Then\r\nthe fox got up behind; and presently the wolf, the bear, the goat, and\r\nall the beasts of the wood, came and climbed upon the hearse.\r\n\r\nSo on they went till they came to a rapid stream. \xe2\x80\x98How shall we get\r\nover?\xe2\x80\x99 said Chanticleer. Then said a straw, \xe2\x80\x98I will lay myself across,\r\nand you may pass over upon me.\xe2\x80\x99 But as the mice were going over, the\r\nstraw slipped away and fell into the water, and the six mice all fell in\r\nand were drowned. What was to be done? Then a large log of wood came\r\nand said, \xe2\x80\x98I am big enough; I will lay myself across the stream, and you\r\nshall pass over upon me.\xe2\x80\x99 So he laid himself down; but they managed\r\nso clumsily, that the log of wood fell in and was carried away by the\r\nstream. Then a stone, who saw what had happened, came up and kindly\r\noffered to help poor Chanticleer by laying himself across the stream;\r\nand this time he got safely to the other side with the hearse, and\r\nmanaged to get Partlet out of it; but the fox and the other mourners,\r\nwho were sitting behind, were too heavy, and fell back into the water\r\nand were all carried away by the stream and drowned.\r\n\r\nThus Chanticleer was left alone with his dead Partlet; and having dug\r\na grave for her, he laid her in it, and made a little hillock over her.\r\nThen he sat down by the grave, and wept and mourned, till at last he\r\ndied too; and so all were dead.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRAPUNZEL\r\n\r\nThere were once a man and a woman who had long in vain wished for a\r\nchild. At length the woman hoped that God was about to grant her desire.\r\nThese people had a little window at the back of their house from which\r\na splendid garden could be seen, which was full of the most beautiful\r\nflowers and herbs. It was, however, surrounded by a high wall, and no\r\none dared to go into it because it belonged to an enchantress, who had\r\ngreat power and was dreaded by all the world. One day the woman was\r\nstanding by this window and looking down into the garden, when she saw a\r\nbed which was planted with the most beautiful rampion (rapunzel), and it\r\nlooked so fresh and green that she longed for it, she quite pined away,\r\nand began to look pale and miserable. Then her husband was alarmed, and\r\nasked: \xe2\x80\x98What ails you, dear wife?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Ah,\xe2\x80\x99 she replied, \xe2\x80\x98if I can\xe2\x80\x99t eat\r\nsome of the rampion, which is in the garden behind our house, I shall\r\ndie.\xe2\x80\x99 The man, who loved her, thought: \xe2\x80\x98Sooner than let your wife die,\r\nbring her some of the rampion yourself, let it cost what it will.\xe2\x80\x99\r\nAt twilight, he clambered down over the wall into the garden of the\r\nenchantress, hastily clutched a handful of rampion, and took it to his\r\nwife. She at once made herself a salad of it, and ate it greedily. It\r\ntasted so good to her--so very good, that the next day she longed for it\r\nthree times as much as before. If he was to have any rest, her husband\r\nmust once more descend into the garden. In the gloom of evening\r\ntherefore, he let himself down again; but when he had clambered down the\r\nwall he was terribly afraid, for he saw the enchantress standing before\r\nhim. \xe2\x80\x98How can you dare,\xe2\x80\x99 said she with angry look, \xe2\x80\x98descend into my\r\ngarden and steal my rampion like a thief? You shall suffer for it!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah,\xe2\x80\x99 answered he, \xe2\x80\x98let mercy take the place of justice, I only made\r\nup my mind to do it out of necessity. My wife saw your rampion from the\r\nwindow, and felt such a longing for it that she would have died if she\r\nhad not got some to eat.\xe2\x80\x99 Then the enchantress allowed her anger to be\r\nsoftened, and said to him: \xe2\x80\x98If the case be as you say, I will allow\r\nyou to take away with you as much rampion as you will, only I make one\r\ncondition, you must give me the child which your wife will bring into\r\nthe world; it shall be well treated, and I will care for it like a\r\nmother.\xe2\x80\x99 The man in his terror consented to everything, and when the\r\nwoman was brought to bed, the enchantress appeared at once, gave the\r\nchild the name of Rapunzel, and took it away with her.\r\n\r\nRapunzel grew into the most beautiful child under the sun. When she was\r\ntwelve years old, the enchantress shut her into a tower, which lay in\r\na forest, and had neither stairs nor door, but quite at the top was a\r\nlittle window. When the enchantress wanted to go in, she placed herself\r\nbeneath it and cried:\r\n\r\n \xe2\x80\x98Rapunzel, Rapunzel,\r\n  Let down your hair to me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nRapunzel had magnificent long hair, fine as spun gold, and when she\r\nheard the voice of the enchantress she unfastened her braided tresses,\r\nwound them round one of the hooks of the window above, and then the hair\r\nfell twenty ells down, and the enchantress climbed up by it.\r\n\r\nAfter a year or two, it came to pass that the king\xe2\x80\x99s son rode through\r\nthe forest and passed by the tower. Then he heard a song, which was so\r\ncharming that he stood still and listened. This was Rapunzel, who in her\r\nsolitude passed her time in letting her sweet voice resound. The king\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nson wanted to climb up to her, and looked for the door of the tower,\r\nbut none was to be found. He rode home, but the singing had so deeply\r\ntouched his heart, that every day he went out into the forest and\r\nlistened to it. Once when he was thus standing behind a tree, he saw\r\nthat an enchantress came there, and he heard how she cried:\r\n\r\n \xe2\x80\x98Rapunzel, Rapunzel,\r\n  Let down your hair to me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThen Rapunzel let down the braids of her hair, and the enchantress\r\nclimbed up to her. \xe2\x80\x98If that is the ladder by which one mounts, I too\r\nwill try my fortune,\xe2\x80\x99 said he, and the next day when it began to grow\r\ndark, he went to the tower and cried:\r\n\r\n \xe2\x80\x98Rapunzel, Rapunzel,\r\n  Let down your hair to me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nImmediately the hair fell down and the king\xe2\x80\x99s son climbed up.\r\n\r\nAt first Rapunzel was terribly frightened when a man, such as her eyes\r\nhad never yet beheld, came to her; but the king\xe2\x80\x99s son began to talk to\r\nher quite like a friend, and told her that his heart had been so stirred\r\nthat it had let him have no rest, and he had been forced to see her.\r\nThen Rapunzel lost her fear, and when he asked her if she would take\r\nhim for her husband, and she saw that he was young and handsome, she\r\nthought: \xe2\x80\x98He will love me more than old Dame Gothel does\xe2\x80\x99; and she said\r\nyes, and laid her hand in his. She said: \xe2\x80\x98I will willingly go away with\r\nyou, but I do not know how to get down. Bring with you a skein of silk\r\nevery time that you come, and I will weave a ladder with it, and when\r\nthat is ready I will descend, and you will take me on your horse.\xe2\x80\x99 They\r\nagreed that until that time he should come to her every evening, for the\r\nold woman came by day. The enchantress remarked nothing of this, until\r\nonce Rapunzel said to her: \xe2\x80\x98Tell me, Dame Gothel, how it happens that\r\nyou are so much heavier for me to draw up than the young king\xe2\x80\x99s son--he\r\nis with me in a moment.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Ah! you wicked child,\xe2\x80\x99 cried the enchantress.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What do I hear you say! I thought I had separated you from all\r\nthe world, and yet you have deceived me!\xe2\x80\x99 In her anger she clutched\r\nRapunzel\xe2\x80\x99s beautiful tresses, wrapped them twice round her left hand,\r\nseized a pair of scissors with the right, and snip, snap, they were cut\r\noff, and the lovely braids lay on the ground. And she was so pitiless\r\nthat she took poor Rapunzel into a desert where she had to live in great\r\ngrief and misery.\r\n\r\nOn the same day that she cast out Rapunzel, however, the enchantress\r\nfastened the braids of hair, which she had cut off, to the hook of the\r\nwindow, and when the king\xe2\x80\x99s son came and cried:\r\n\r\n \xe2\x80\x98Rapunzel, Rapunzel,\r\n  Let down your hair to me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nshe let the hair down. The king\xe2\x80\x99s son ascended, but instead of finding\r\nhis dearest Rapunzel, he found the enchantress, who gazed at him with\r\nwicked and venomous looks. \xe2\x80\x98Aha!\xe2\x80\x99 she cried mockingly, \xe2\x80\x98you would fetch\r\nyour dearest, but the beautiful bird sits no longer singing in the nest;\r\nthe cat has got it, and will scratch out your eyes as well. Rapunzel is\r\nlost to you; you will never see her again.\xe2\x80\x99 The king\xe2\x80\x99s son was beside\r\nhimself with pain, and in his despair he leapt down from the tower. He\r\nescaped with his life, but the thorns into which he fell pierced his\r\neyes. Then he wandered quite blind about the forest, ate nothing but\r\nroots and berries, and did naught but lament and weep over the loss of\r\nhis dearest wife. Thus he roamed about in misery for some years, and at\r\nlength came to the desert where Rapunzel, with the twins to which she\r\nhad given birth, a boy and a girl, lived in wretchedness. He heard a\r\nvoice, and it seemed so familiar to him that he went towards it, and\r\nwhen he approached, Rapunzel knew him and fell on his neck and wept. Two\r\nof her tears wetted his eyes and they grew clear again, and he could\r\nsee with them as before. He led her to his kingdom where he was\r\njoyfully received, and they lived for a long time afterwards, happy and\r\ncontented.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFUNDEVOGEL\r\n\r\nThere was once a forester who went into the forest to hunt, and as\r\nhe entered it he heard a sound of screaming as if a little child were\r\nthere. He followed the sound, and at last came to a high tree, and at\r\nthe top of this a little child was sitting, for the mother had fallen\r\nasleep under the tree with the child, and a bird of prey had seen it in\r\nher arms, had flown down, snatched it away, and set it on the high tree.\r\n\r\nThe forester climbed up, brought the child down, and thought to himself:\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You will take him home with you, and bring him up with your Lina.\xe2\x80\x99 He\r\ntook it home, therefore, and the two children grew up together. And the\r\none, which he had found on a tree was called Fundevogel, because a bird\r\nhad carried it away. Fundevogel and Lina loved each other so dearly that\r\nwhen they did not see each other they were sad.\r\n\r\nNow the forester had an old cook, who one evening took two pails and\r\nbegan to fetch water, and did not go once only, but many times, out\r\nto the spring. Lina saw this and said, \xe2\x80\x98Listen, old Sanna, why are you\r\nfetching so much water?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98If you will never repeat it to anyone, I will\r\ntell you why.\xe2\x80\x99 So Lina said, no, she would never repeat it to anyone,\r\nand then the cook said: \xe2\x80\x98Early tomorrow morning, when the forester\r\nis out hunting, I will heat the water, and when it is boiling in the\r\nkettle, I will throw in Fundevogel, and will boil him in it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nEarly next morning the forester got up and went out hunting, and when he\r\nwas gone the children were still in bed. Then Lina said to Fundevogel:\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If you will never leave me, I too will never leave you.\xe2\x80\x99 Fundevogel\r\nsaid: \xe2\x80\x98Neither now, nor ever will I leave you.\xe2\x80\x99 Then said Lina: \xe2\x80\x98Then\r\nwill I tell you. Last night, old Sanna carried so many buckets of water\r\ninto the house that I asked her why she was doing that, and she said\r\nthat if I would promise not to tell anyone, and she said that early\r\ntomorrow morning when father was out hunting, she would set the kettle\r\nfull of water, throw you into it and boil you; but we will get up\r\nquickly, dress ourselves, and go away together.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe two children therefore got up, dressed themselves quickly, and went\r\naway. When the water in the kettle was boiling, the cook went into the\r\nbedroom to fetch Fundevogel and throw him into it. But when she came in,\r\nand went to the beds, both the children were gone. Then she was terribly\r\nalarmed, and she said to herself: \xe2\x80\x98What shall I say now when the\r\nforester comes home and sees that the children are gone? They must be\r\nfollowed instantly to get them back again.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThen the cook sent three servants after them, who were to run and\r\novertake the children. The children, however, were sitting outside the\r\nforest, and when they saw from afar the three servants running, Lina\r\nsaid to Fundevogel: \xe2\x80\x98Never leave me, and I will never leave you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\nFundevogel said: \xe2\x80\x98Neither now, nor ever.\xe2\x80\x99 Then said Lina: \xe2\x80\x98Do you become\r\na rose-tree, and I the rose upon it.\xe2\x80\x99 When the three servants came to\r\nthe forest, nothing was there but a rose-tree and one rose on it, but\r\nthe children were nowhere. Then said they: \xe2\x80\x98There is nothing to be done\r\nhere,\xe2\x80\x99 and they went home and told the cook that they had seen nothing\r\nin the forest but a little rose-bush with one rose on it. Then the\r\nold cook scolded and said: \xe2\x80\x98You simpletons, you should have cut the\r\nrose-bush in two, and have broken off the rose and brought it home with\r\nyou; go, and do it at once.\xe2\x80\x99 They had therefore to go out and look for\r\nthe second time. The children, however, saw them coming from a distance.\r\nThen Lina said: \xe2\x80\x98Fundevogel, never leave me, and I will never leave\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x99 Fundevogel said: \xe2\x80\x98Neither now; nor ever.\xe2\x80\x99 Said Lina: \xe2\x80\x98Then do you\r\nbecome a church, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll be the chandelier in it.\xe2\x80\x99 So when the three\r\nservants came, nothing was there but a church, with a chandelier in\r\nit. They said therefore to each other: \xe2\x80\x98What can we do here, let us go\r\nhome.\xe2\x80\x99 When they got home, the cook asked if they had not found them;\r\nso they said no, they had found nothing but a church, and there was a\r\nchandelier in it. And the cook scolded them and said: \xe2\x80\x98You fools! why\r\ndid you not pull the church to pieces, and bring the chandelier home\r\nwith you?\xe2\x80\x99 And now the old cook herself got on her legs, and went with\r\nthe three servants in pursuit of the children. The children, however,\r\nsaw from afar that the three servants were coming, and the cook waddling\r\nafter them. Then said Lina: \xe2\x80\x98Fundevogel, never leave me, and I will\r\nnever leave you.\xe2\x80\x99 Then said Fundevogel: \xe2\x80\x98Neither now, nor ever.\xe2\x80\x99\r\nSaid Lina: \xe2\x80\x98Be a fishpond, and I will be the duck upon it.\xe2\x80\x99 The cook,\r\nhowever, came up to them, and when she saw the pond she lay down by it,\r\nand was about to drink it up. But the duck swam quickly to her, seized\r\nher head in its beak and drew her into the water, and there the old\r\nwitch had to drown. Then the children went home together, and were\r\nheartily delighted, and if they have not died, they are living still.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE VALIANT LITTLE TAILOR\r\n\r\nOne summer\xe2\x80\x99s morning a little tailor was sitting on his table by the\r\nwindow; he was in good spirits, and sewed with all his might. Then came\r\na peasant woman down the street crying: \xe2\x80\x98Good jams, cheap! Good jams,\r\ncheap!\xe2\x80\x99 This rang pleasantly in the tailor\xe2\x80\x99s ears; he stretched his\r\ndelicate head out of the window, and called: \xe2\x80\x98Come up here, dear woman;\r\nhere you will get rid of your goods.\xe2\x80\x99 The woman came up the three steps\r\nto the tailor with her heavy basket, and he made her unpack all the pots\r\nfor him. He inspected each one, lifted it up, put his nose to it, and\r\nat length said: \xe2\x80\x98The jam seems to me to be good, so weigh me out four\r\nounces, dear woman, and if it is a quarter of a pound that is of no\r\nconsequence.\xe2\x80\x99 The woman who had hoped to find a good sale, gave him\r\nwhat he desired, but went away quite angry and grumbling. \xe2\x80\x98Now, this jam\r\nshall be blessed by God,\xe2\x80\x99 cried the little tailor, \xe2\x80\x98and give me health\r\nand strength\xe2\x80\x99; so he brought the bread out of the cupboard, cut himself\r\na piece right across the loaf and spread the jam over it. \xe2\x80\x98This won\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ntaste bitter,\xe2\x80\x99 said he, \xe2\x80\x98but I will just finish the jacket before I\r\ntake a bite.\xe2\x80\x99 He laid the bread near him, sewed on, and in his joy, made\r\nbigger and bigger stitches. In the meantime the smell of the sweet jam\r\nrose to where the flies were sitting in great numbers, and they were\r\nattracted and descended on it in hosts. \xe2\x80\x98Hi! who invited you?\xe2\x80\x99 said the\r\nlittle tailor, and drove the unbidden guests away. The flies, however,\r\nwho understood no German, would not be turned away, but came back\r\nagain in ever-increasing companies. The little tailor at last lost all\r\npatience, and drew a piece of cloth from the hole under his work-table,\r\nand saying: \xe2\x80\x98Wait, and I will give it to you,\xe2\x80\x99 struck it mercilessly on\r\nthem. When he drew it away and counted, there lay before him no fewer\r\nthan seven, dead and with legs stretched out. \xe2\x80\x98Are you a fellow of that\r\nsort?\xe2\x80\x99 said he, and could not help admiring his own bravery. \xe2\x80\x98The whole\r\ntown shall know of this!\xe2\x80\x99 And the little tailor hastened to cut himself\r\na girdle, stitched it, and embroidered on it in large letters: \xe2\x80\x98Seven at\r\none stroke!\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98What, the town!\xe2\x80\x99 he continued, \xe2\x80\x98the whole world shall hear\r\nof it!\xe2\x80\x99 and his heart wagged with joy like a lamb\xe2\x80\x99s tail. The tailor\r\nput on the girdle, and resolved to go forth into the world, because he\r\nthought his workshop was too small for his valour. Before he went away,\r\nhe sought about in the house to see if there was anything which he could\r\ntake with him; however, he found nothing but an old cheese, and that\r\nhe put in his pocket. In front of the door he observed a bird which\r\nhad caught itself in the thicket. It had to go into his pocket with the\r\ncheese. Now he took to the road boldly, and as he was light and nimble,\r\nhe felt no fatigue. The road led him up a mountain, and when he had\r\nreached the highest point of it, there sat a powerful giant looking\r\npeacefully about him. The little tailor went bravely up, spoke to him,\r\nand said: \xe2\x80\x98Good day, comrade, so you are sitting there overlooking the\r\nwide-spread world! I am just on my way thither, and want to try my luck.\r\nHave you any inclination to go with me?\xe2\x80\x99 The giant looked contemptuously\r\nat the tailor, and said: \xe2\x80\x98You ragamuffin! You miserable creature!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh, indeed?\xe2\x80\x99 answered the little tailor, and unbuttoned his coat, and\r\nshowed the giant the girdle, \xe2\x80\x98there may you read what kind of a man I\r\nam!\xe2\x80\x99 The giant read: \xe2\x80\x98Seven at one stroke,\xe2\x80\x99 and thought that they had\r\nbeen men whom the tailor had killed, and began to feel a little respect\r\nfor the tiny fellow. Nevertheless, he wished to try him first, and took\r\na stone in his hand and squeezed it together so that water dropped out\r\nof it. \xe2\x80\x98Do that likewise,\xe2\x80\x99 said the giant, \xe2\x80\x98if you have strength.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Is\r\nthat all?\xe2\x80\x99 said the tailor, \xe2\x80\x98that is child\xe2\x80\x99s play with us!\xe2\x80\x99 and put his\r\nhand into his pocket, brought out the soft cheese, and pressed it until\r\nthe liquid ran out of it. \xe2\x80\x98Faith,\xe2\x80\x99 said he, \xe2\x80\x98that was a little better,\r\nwasn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x99 The giant did not know what to say, and could not believe it\r\nof the little man. Then the giant picked up a stone and threw it so high\r\nthat the eye could scarcely follow it. \xe2\x80\x98Now, little mite of a man, do\r\nthat likewise,\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Well thrown,\xe2\x80\x99 said the tailor, \xe2\x80\x98but after all the stone\r\ncame down to earth again; I will throw you one which shall never come\r\nback at all,\xe2\x80\x99 and he put his hand into his pocket, took out the bird,\r\nand threw it into the air. The bird, delighted with its liberty,\r\nrose, flew away and did not come back. \xe2\x80\x98How does that shot please you,\r\ncomrade?\xe2\x80\x99 asked the tailor. \xe2\x80\x98You can certainly throw,\xe2\x80\x99 said the giant,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98but now we will see if you are able to carry anything properly.\xe2\x80\x99 He\r\ntook the little tailor to a mighty oak tree which lay there felled on\r\nthe ground, and said: \xe2\x80\x98If you are strong enough, help me to carry the\r\ntree out of the forest.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Readily,\xe2\x80\x99 answered the little man; \xe2\x80\x98take you\r\nthe trunk on your shoulders, and I will raise up the branches and twigs;\r\nafter all, they are the heaviest.\xe2\x80\x99 The giant took the trunk on his\r\nshoulder, but the tailor seated himself on a branch, and the giant, who\r\ncould not look round, had to carry away the whole tree, and the little\r\ntailor into the bargain: he behind, was quite merry and happy, and\r\nwhistled the song: \xe2\x80\x98Three tailors rode forth from the gate,\xe2\x80\x99 as if\r\ncarrying the tree were child\xe2\x80\x99s play. The giant, after he had dragged the\r\nheavy burden part of the way, could go no further, and cried: \xe2\x80\x98Hark\r\nyou, I shall have to let the tree fall!\xe2\x80\x99 The tailor sprang nimbly down,\r\nseized the tree with both arms as if he had been carrying it, and said\r\nto the giant: \xe2\x80\x98You are such a great fellow, and yet cannot even carry\r\nthe tree!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThey went on together, and as they passed a cherry-tree, the giant laid\r\nhold of the top of the tree where the ripest fruit was hanging, bent it\r\ndown, gave it into the tailor\xe2\x80\x99s hand, and bade him eat. But the little\r\ntailor was much too weak to hold the tree, and when the giant let it go,\r\nit sprang back again, and the tailor was tossed into the air with it.\r\nWhen he had fallen down again without injury, the giant said: \xe2\x80\x98What is\r\nthis? Have you not strength enough to hold the weak twig?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98There is no\r\nlack of strength,\xe2\x80\x99 answered the little tailor. \xe2\x80\x98Do you think that could\r\nbe anything to a man who has struck down seven at one blow? I leapt over\r\nthe tree because the huntsmen are shooting down there in the thicket.\r\nJump as I did, if you can do it.\xe2\x80\x99 The giant made the attempt but he\r\ncould not get over the tree, and remained hanging in the branches, so\r\nthat in this also the tailor kept the upper hand.\r\n\r\nThe giant said: \xe2\x80\x98If you are such a valiant fellow, come with me into our\r\ncavern and spend the night with us.\xe2\x80\x99 The little tailor was willing, and\r\nfollowed him. When they went into the cave, other giants were sitting\r\nthere by the fire, and each of them had a roasted sheep in his hand and\r\nwas eating it. The little tailor looked round and thought: \xe2\x80\x98It is much\r\nmore spacious here than in my workshop.\xe2\x80\x99 The giant showed him a bed, and\r\nsaid he was to lie down in it and sleep. The bed, however, was too\r\nbig for the little tailor; he did not lie down in it, but crept into\r\na corner. When it was midnight, and the giant thought that the little\r\ntailor was lying in a sound sleep, he got up, took a great iron bar,\r\ncut through the bed with one blow, and thought he had finished off the\r\ngrasshopper for good. With the earliest dawn the giants went into the\r\nforest, and had quite forgotten the little tailor, when all at once he\r\nwalked up to them quite merrily and boldly. The giants were terrified,\r\nthey were afraid that he would strike them all dead, and ran away in a\r\ngreat hurry.\r\n\r\nThe little tailor went onwards, always following his own pointed nose.\r\nAfter he had walked for a long time, he came to the courtyard of a royal\r\npalace, and as he felt weary, he lay down on the grass and fell asleep.\r\nWhilst he lay there, the people came and inspected him on all sides, and\r\nread on his girdle: \xe2\x80\x98Seven at one stroke.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Ah!\xe2\x80\x99 said they, \xe2\x80\x98what does\r\nthe great warrior want here in the midst of peace? He must be a mighty\r\nlord.\xe2\x80\x99 They went and announced him to the king, and gave it as their\r\nopinion that if war should break out, this would be a weighty and useful\r\nman who ought on no account to be allowed to depart. The counsel pleased\r\nthe king, and he sent one of his courtiers to the little tailor to offer\r\nhim military service when he awoke. The ambassador remained standing by\r\nthe sleeper, waited until he stretched his limbs and opened his eyes,\r\nand then conveyed to him this proposal. \xe2\x80\x98For this very reason have\r\nI come here,\xe2\x80\x99 the tailor replied, \xe2\x80\x98I am ready to enter the king\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nservice.\xe2\x80\x99 He was therefore honourably received, and a special dwelling\r\nwas assigned him.\r\n\r\nThe soldiers, however, were set against the little tailor, and wished\r\nhim a thousand miles away. \xe2\x80\x98What is to be the end of this?\xe2\x80\x99 they said\r\namong themselves. \xe2\x80\x98If we quarrel with him, and he strikes about him,\r\nseven of us will fall at every blow; not one of us can stand against\r\nhim.\xe2\x80\x99 They came therefore to a decision, betook themselves in a body to\r\nthe king, and begged for their dismissal. \xe2\x80\x98We are not prepared,\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nthey, \xe2\x80\x98to stay with a man who kills seven at one stroke.\xe2\x80\x99 The king was\r\nsorry that for the sake of one he should lose all his faithful servants,\r\nwished that he had never set eyes on the tailor, and would willingly\r\nhave been rid of him again. But he did not venture to give him his\r\ndismissal, for he dreaded lest he should strike him and all his people\r\ndead, and place himself on the royal throne. He thought about it for a\r\nlong time, and at last found good counsel. He sent to the little tailor\r\nand caused him to be informed that as he was a great warrior, he had one\r\nrequest to make to him. In a forest of his country lived two giants,\r\nwho caused great mischief with their robbing, murdering, ravaging,\r\nand burning, and no one could approach them without putting himself in\r\ndanger of death. If the tailor conquered and killed these two giants, he\r\nwould give him his only daughter to wife, and half of his kingdom as a\r\ndowry, likewise one hundred horsemen should go with him to assist him.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That would indeed be a fine thing for a man like me!\xe2\x80\x99 thought the\r\nlittle tailor. \xe2\x80\x98One is not offered a beautiful princess and half a\r\nkingdom every day of one\xe2\x80\x99s life!\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Oh, yes,\xe2\x80\x99 he replied, \xe2\x80\x98I will soon\r\nsubdue the giants, and do not require the help of the hundred horsemen\r\nto do it; he who can hit seven with one blow has no need to be afraid of\r\ntwo.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe little tailor went forth, and the hundred horsemen followed him.\r\nWhen he came to the outskirts of the forest, he said to his followers:\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Just stay waiting here, I alone will soon finish off the giants.\xe2\x80\x99 Then\r\nhe bounded into the forest and looked about right and left. After a\r\nwhile he perceived both giants. They lay sleeping under a tree, and\r\nsnored so that the branches waved up and down. The little tailor, not\r\nidle, gathered two pocketsful of stones, and with these climbed up the\r\ntree. When he was halfway up, he slipped down by a branch, until he sat\r\njust above the sleepers, and then let one stone after another fall on\r\nthe breast of one of the giants. For a long time the giant felt nothing,\r\nbut at last he awoke, pushed his comrade, and said: \xe2\x80\x98Why are you\r\nknocking me?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98You must be dreaming,\xe2\x80\x99 said the other, \xe2\x80\x98I am not knocking\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x99 They laid themselves down to sleep again, and then the tailor\r\nthrew a stone down on the second. \xe2\x80\x98What is the meaning of this?\xe2\x80\x99 cried\r\nthe other \xe2\x80\x98Why are you pelting me?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98I am not pelting you,\xe2\x80\x99 answered\r\nthe first, growling. They disputed about it for a time, but as they were\r\nweary they let the matter rest, and their eyes closed once more. The\r\nlittle tailor began his game again, picked out the biggest stone, and\r\nthrew it with all his might on the breast of the first giant. \xe2\x80\x98That\r\nis too bad!\xe2\x80\x99 cried he, and sprang up like a madman, and pushed his\r\ncompanion against the tree until it shook. The other paid him back in\r\nthe same coin, and they got into such a rage that they tore up trees and\r\nbelaboured each other so long, that at last they both fell down dead on\r\nthe ground at the same time. Then the little tailor leapt down. \xe2\x80\x98It is\r\na lucky thing,\xe2\x80\x99 said he, \xe2\x80\x98that they did not tear up the tree on which\r\nI was sitting, or I should have had to sprint on to another like a\r\nsquirrel; but we tailors are nimble.\xe2\x80\x99 He drew out his sword and gave\r\neach of them a couple of thrusts in the breast, and then went out to the\r\nhorsemen and said: \xe2\x80\x98The work is done; I have finished both of them\r\noff, but it was hard work! They tore up trees in their sore need, and\r\ndefended themselves with them, but all that is to no purpose when a man\r\nlike myself comes, who can kill seven at one blow.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98But are you not\r\nwounded?\xe2\x80\x99 asked the horsemen. \xe2\x80\x98You need not concern yourself about\r\nthat,\xe2\x80\x99 answered the tailor, \xe2\x80\x98they have not bent one hair of mine.\xe2\x80\x99 The\r\nhorsemen would not believe him, and rode into the forest; there they\r\nfound the giants swimming in their blood, and all round about lay the\r\ntorn-up trees.\r\n\r\nThe little tailor demanded of the king the promised reward; he, however,\r\nrepented of his promise, and again bethought himself how he could get\r\nrid of the hero. \xe2\x80\x98Before you receive my daughter, and the half of my\r\nkingdom,\xe2\x80\x99 said he to him, \xe2\x80\x98you must perform one more heroic deed. In\r\nthe forest roams a unicorn which does great harm, and you must catch\r\nit first.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98I fear one unicorn still less than two giants. Seven at one\r\nblow, is my kind of affair.\xe2\x80\x99 He took a rope and an axe with him, went\r\nforth into the forest, and again bade those who were sent with him to\r\nwait outside. He had not long to seek. The unicorn soon came towards\r\nhim, and rushed directly on the tailor, as if it would gore him with its\r\nhorn without more ado. \xe2\x80\x98Softly, softly; it can\xe2\x80\x99t be done as quickly as\r\nthat,\xe2\x80\x99 said he, and stood still and waited until the animal was quite\r\nclose, and then sprang nimbly behind the tree. The unicorn ran against\r\nthe tree with all its strength, and stuck its horn so fast in the trunk\r\nthat it had not the strength enough to draw it out again, and thus it\r\nwas caught. \xe2\x80\x98Now, I have got the bird,\xe2\x80\x99 said the tailor, and came out\r\nfrom behind the tree and put the rope round its neck, and then with his\r\naxe he hewed the horn out of the tree, and when all was ready he led the\r\nbeast away and took it to the king.\r\n\r\nThe king still would not give him the promised reward, and made a third\r\ndemand. Before the wedding the tailor was to catch him a wild boar that\r\nmade great havoc in the forest, and the huntsmen should give him their\r\nhelp. \xe2\x80\x98Willingly,\xe2\x80\x99 said the tailor, \xe2\x80\x98that is child\xe2\x80\x99s play!\xe2\x80\x99 He did not\r\ntake the huntsmen with him into the forest, and they were well pleased\r\nthat he did not, for the wild boar had several times received them in\r\nsuch a manner that they had no inclination to lie in wait for him. When\r\nthe boar perceived the tailor, it ran on him with foaming mouth and\r\nwhetted tusks, and was about to throw him to the ground, but the hero\r\nfled and sprang into a chapel which was near and up to the window at\r\nonce, and in one bound out again. The boar ran after him, but the tailor\r\nran round outside and shut the door behind it, and then the raging\r\nbeast, which was much too heavy and awkward to leap out of the window,\r\nwas caught. The little tailor called the huntsmen thither that they\r\nmight see the prisoner with their own eyes. The hero, however, went to\r\nthe king, who was now, whether he liked it or not, obliged to keep his\r\npromise, and gave his daughter and the half of his kingdom. Had he known\r\nthat it was no warlike hero, but a little tailor who was standing before\r\nhim, it would have gone to his heart still more than it did. The wedding\r\nwas held with great magnificence and small joy, and out of a tailor a\r\nking was made.\r\n\r\nAfter some time the young queen heard her husband say in his dreams at\r\nnight: \xe2\x80\x98Boy, make me the doublet, and patch the pantaloons, or else I\r\nwill rap the yard-measure over your ears.\xe2\x80\x99 Then she discovered in what\r\nstate of life the young lord had been born, and next morning complained\r\nof her wrongs to her father, and begged him to help her to get rid of\r\nher husband, who was nothing else but a tailor. The king comforted her\r\nand said: \xe2\x80\x98Leave your bedroom door open this night, and my servants\r\nshall stand outside, and when he has fallen asleep shall go in, bind\r\nhim, and take him on board a ship which shall carry him into the wide\r\nworld.\xe2\x80\x99 The woman was satisfied with this; but the king\xe2\x80\x99s armour-bearer,\r\nwho had heard all, was friendly with the young lord, and informed him of\r\nthe whole plot. \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll put a screw into that business,\xe2\x80\x99 said the little\r\ntailor. At night he went to bed with his wife at the usual time, and\r\nwhen she thought that he had fallen asleep, she got up, opened the door,\r\nand then lay down again. The little tailor, who was only pretending to\r\nbe asleep, began to cry out in a clear voice: \xe2\x80\x98Boy, make me the doublet\r\nand patch me the pantaloons, or I will rap the yard-measure over your\r\nears. I smote seven at one blow. I killed two giants, I brought away one\r\nunicorn, and caught a wild boar, and am I to fear those who are standing\r\noutside the room.\xe2\x80\x99 When these men heard the tailor speaking thus, they\r\nwere overcome by a great dread, and ran as if the wild huntsman were\r\nbehind them, and none of them would venture anything further against\r\nhim. So the little tailor was and remained a king to the end of his\r\nlife.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHANSEL AND GRETEL\r\n\r\nHard by a great forest dwelt a poor wood-cutter with his wife and his\r\ntwo children. The boy was called Hansel and the girl Gretel. He had\r\nlittle to bite and to break, and once when great dearth fell on the\r\nland, he could no longer procure even daily bread. Now when he thought\r\nover this by night in his bed, and tossed about in his anxiety, he\r\ngroaned and said to his wife: \xe2\x80\x98What is to become of us? How are we\r\nto feed our poor children, when we no longer have anything even for\r\nourselves?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you what, husband,\xe2\x80\x99 answered the woman, \xe2\x80\x98early\r\ntomorrow morning we will take the children out into the forest to where\r\nit is the thickest; there we will light a fire for them, and give each\r\nof them one more piece of bread, and then we will go to our work and\r\nleave them alone. They will not find the way home again, and we shall be\r\nrid of them.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98No, wife,\xe2\x80\x99 said the man, \xe2\x80\x98I will not do that; how can I\r\nbear to leave my children alone in the forest?--the wild animals would\r\nsoon come and tear them to pieces.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98O, you fool!\xe2\x80\x99 said she, \xe2\x80\x98then we\r\nmust all four die of hunger, you may as well plane the planks for our\r\ncoffins,\xe2\x80\x99 and she left him no peace until he consented. \xe2\x80\x98But I feel very\r\nsorry for the poor children, all the same,\xe2\x80\x99 said the man.\r\n\r\nThe two children had also not been able to sleep for hunger, and had\r\nheard what their stepmother had said to their father. Gretel wept\r\nbitter tears, and said to Hansel: \xe2\x80\x98Now all is over with us.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Be quiet,\r\nGretel,\xe2\x80\x99 said Hansel, \xe2\x80\x98do not distress yourself, I will soon find a way\r\nto help us.\xe2\x80\x99 And when the old folks had fallen asleep, he got up, put\r\non his little coat, opened the door below, and crept outside. The moon\r\nshone brightly, and the white pebbles which lay in front of the house\r\nglittered like real silver pennies. Hansel stooped and stuffed the\r\nlittle pocket of his coat with as many as he could get in. Then he went\r\nback and said to Gretel: \xe2\x80\x98Be comforted, dear little sister, and sleep in\r\npeace, God will not forsake us,\xe2\x80\x99 and he lay down again in his bed. When\r\nday dawned, but before the sun had risen, the woman came and awoke the\r\ntwo children, saying: \xe2\x80\x98Get up, you sluggards! we are going into the\r\nforest to fetch wood.\xe2\x80\x99 She gave each a little piece of bread, and said:\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There is something for your dinner, but do not eat it up before then,\r\nfor you will get nothing else.\xe2\x80\x99 Gretel took the bread under her apron,\r\nas Hansel had the pebbles in his pocket. Then they all set out together\r\non the way to the forest. When they had walked a short time, Hansel\r\nstood still and peeped back at the house, and did so again and again.\r\nHis father said: \xe2\x80\x98Hansel, what are you looking at there and staying\r\nbehind for? Pay attention, and do not forget how to use your legs.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Ah,\r\nfather,\xe2\x80\x99 said Hansel, \xe2\x80\x98I am looking at my little white cat, which is\r\nsitting up on the roof, and wants to say goodbye to me.\xe2\x80\x99 The wife said:\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Fool, that is not your little cat, that is the morning sun which is\r\nshining on the chimneys.\xe2\x80\x99 Hansel, however, had not been looking back at\r\nthe cat, but had been constantly throwing one of the white pebble-stones\r\nout of his pocket on the road.\r\n\r\nWhen they had reached the middle of the forest, the father said: \xe2\x80\x98Now,\r\nchildren, pile up some wood, and I will light a fire that you may not\r\nbe cold.\xe2\x80\x99 Hansel and Gretel gathered brushwood together, as high as a\r\nlittle hill. The brushwood was lighted, and when the flames were burning\r\nvery high, the woman said: \xe2\x80\x98Now, children, lay yourselves down by the\r\nfire and rest, we will go into the forest and cut some wood. When we\r\nhave done, we will come back and fetch you away.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHansel and Gretel sat by the fire, and when noon came, each ate a little\r\npiece of bread, and as they heard the strokes of the wood-axe they\r\nbelieved that their father was near. It was not the axe, however, but\r\na branch which he had fastened to a withered tree which the wind was\r\nblowing backwards and forwards. And as they had been sitting such a long\r\ntime, their eyes closed with fatigue, and they fell fast asleep. When\r\nat last they awoke, it was already dark night. Gretel began to cry and\r\nsaid: \xe2\x80\x98How are we to get out of the forest now?\xe2\x80\x99 But Hansel comforted\r\nher and said: \xe2\x80\x98Just wait a little, until the moon has risen, and then we\r\nwill soon find the way.\xe2\x80\x99 And when the full moon had risen, Hansel took\r\nhis little sister by the hand, and followed the pebbles which shone like\r\nnewly-coined silver pieces, and showed them the way.\r\n\r\nThey walked the whole night long, and by break of day came once more\r\nto their father\xe2\x80\x99s house. They knocked at the door, and when the woman\r\nopened it and saw that it was Hansel and Gretel, she said: \xe2\x80\x98You naughty\r\nchildren, why have you slept so long in the forest?--we thought you were\r\nnever coming back at all!\xe2\x80\x99 The father, however, rejoiced, for it had cut\r\nhim to the heart to leave them behind alone.\r\n\r\nNot long afterwards, there was once more great dearth throughout the\r\nland, and the children heard their mother saying at night to their\r\nfather: \xe2\x80\x98Everything is eaten again, we have one half loaf left, and that\r\nis the end. The children must go, we will take them farther into the\r\nwood, so that they will not find their way out again; there is no other\r\nmeans of saving ourselves!\xe2\x80\x99 The man\xe2\x80\x99s heart was heavy, and he thought:\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It would be better for you to share the last mouthful with your\r\nchildren.\xe2\x80\x99 The woman, however, would listen to nothing that he had to\r\nsay, but scolded and reproached him. He who says A must say B, likewise,\r\nand as he had yielded the first time, he had to do so a second time\r\nalso.\r\n\r\nThe children, however, were still awake and had heard the conversation.\r\nWhen the old folks were asleep, Hansel again got up, and wanted to go\r\nout and pick up pebbles as he had done before, but the woman had locked\r\nthe door, and Hansel could not get out. Nevertheless he comforted his\r\nlittle sister, and said: \xe2\x80\x98Do not cry, Gretel, go to sleep quietly, the\r\ngood God will help us.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nEarly in the morning came the woman, and took the children out of their\r\nbeds. Their piece of bread was given to them, but it was still smaller\r\nthan the time before. On the way into the forest Hansel crumbled his\r\nin his pocket, and often stood still and threw a morsel on the ground.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hansel, why do you stop and look round?\xe2\x80\x99 said the father, \xe2\x80\x98go on.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98I\r\nam looking back at my little pigeon which is sitting on the roof, and\r\nwants to say goodbye to me,\xe2\x80\x99 answered Hansel. \xe2\x80\x98Fool!\xe2\x80\x99 said the woman,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98that is not your little pigeon, that is the morning sun that is shining\r\non the chimney.\xe2\x80\x99 Hansel, however little by little, threw all the crumbs\r\non the path.\r\n\r\nThe woman led the children still deeper into the forest, where they had\r\nnever in their lives been before. Then a great fire was again made, and\r\nthe mother said: \xe2\x80\x98Just sit there, you children, and when you are tired\r\nyou may sleep a little; we are going into the forest to cut wood, and in\r\nthe evening when we are done, we will come and fetch you away.\xe2\x80\x99 When\r\nit was noon, Gretel shared her piece of bread with Hansel, who had\r\nscattered his by the way. Then they fell asleep and evening passed, but\r\nno one came to the poor children. They did not awake until it was dark\r\nnight, and Hansel comforted his little sister and said: \xe2\x80\x98Just wait,\r\nGretel, until the moon rises, and then we shall see the crumbs of bread\r\nwhich I have strewn about, they will show us our way home again.\xe2\x80\x99 When\r\nthe moon came they set out, but they found no crumbs, for the many\r\nthousands of birds which fly about in the woods and fields had picked\r\nthem all up. Hansel said to Gretel: \xe2\x80\x98We shall soon find the way,\xe2\x80\x99 but\r\nthey did not find it. They walked the whole night and all the next day\r\ntoo from morning till evening, but they did not get out of the forest,\r\nand were very hungry, for they had nothing to eat but two or three\r\nberries, which grew on the ground. And as they were so weary that their\r\nlegs would carry them no longer, they lay down beneath a tree and fell\r\nasleep.\r\n\r\nIt was now three mornings since they had left their father\xe2\x80\x99s house. They\r\nbegan to walk again, but they always came deeper into the forest, and if\r\nhelp did not come soon, they must die of hunger and weariness. When it\r\nwas mid-day, they saw a beautiful snow-white bird sitting on a bough,\r\nwhich sang so delightfully that they stood still and listened to it. And\r\nwhen its song was over, it spread its wings and flew away before them,\r\nand they followed it until they reached a little house, on the roof of\r\nwhich it alighted; and when they approached the little house they saw\r\nthat it was built of bread and covered with cakes, but that the windows\r\nwere of clear sugar. \xe2\x80\x98We will set to work on that,\xe2\x80\x99 said Hansel, \xe2\x80\x98and\r\nhave a good meal. I will eat a bit of the roof, and you Gretel, can eat\r\nsome of the window, it will taste sweet.\xe2\x80\x99 Hansel reached up above, and\r\nbroke off a little of the roof to try how it tasted, and Gretel leant\r\nagainst the window and nibbled at the panes. Then a soft voice cried\r\nfrom the parlour:\r\n\r\n \xe2\x80\x98Nibble, nibble, gnaw,\r\n  Who is nibbling at my little house?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe children answered:\r\n\r\n \xe2\x80\x98The wind, the wind,\r\n  The heaven-born wind,\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nand went on eating without disturbing themselves. Hansel, who liked the\r\ntaste of the roof, tore down a great piece of it, and Gretel pushed out\r\nthe whole of one round window-pane, sat down, and enjoyed herself with\r\nit. Suddenly the door opened, and a woman as old as the hills, who\r\nsupported herself on crutches, came creeping out. Hansel and Gretel were\r\nso terribly frightened that they let fall what they had in their\r\nhands. The old woman, however, nodded her head, and said: \xe2\x80\x98Oh, you dear\r\nchildren, who has brought you here? do come in, and stay with me. No\r\nharm shall happen to you.\xe2\x80\x99 She took them both by the hand, and led them\r\ninto her little house. Then good food was set before them, milk and\r\npancakes, with sugar, apples, and nuts. Afterwards two pretty little\r\nbeds were covered with clean white linen, and Hansel and Gretel lay down\r\nin them, and thought they were in heaven.\r\n\r\nThe old woman had only pretended to be so kind; she was in reality\r\na wicked witch, who lay in wait for children, and had only built the\r\nlittle house of bread in order to entice them there. When a child fell\r\ninto her power, she killed it, cooked and ate it, and that was a feast\r\nday with her. Witches have red eyes, and cannot see far, but they have\r\na keen scent like the beasts, and are aware when human beings draw near.\r\nWhen Hansel and Gretel came into her neighbourhood, she laughed with\r\nmalice, and said mockingly: \xe2\x80\x98I have them, they shall not escape me\r\nagain!\xe2\x80\x99 Early in the morning before the children were awake, she was\r\nalready up, and when she saw both of them sleeping and looking so\r\npretty, with their plump and rosy cheeks she muttered to herself: \xe2\x80\x98That\r\nwill be a dainty mouthful!\xe2\x80\x99 Then she seized Hansel with her shrivelled\r\nhand, carried him into a little stable, and locked him in behind a\r\ngrated door. Scream as he might, it would not help him. Then she went to\r\nGretel, shook her till she awoke, and cried: \xe2\x80\x98Get up, lazy thing, fetch\r\nsome water, and cook something good for your brother, he is in the\r\nstable outside, and is to be made fat. When he is fat, I will eat him.\xe2\x80\x99\r\nGretel began to weep bitterly, but it was all in vain, for she was\r\nforced to do what the wicked witch commanded.\r\n\r\nAnd now the best food was cooked for poor Hansel, but Gretel got nothing\r\nbut crab-shells. Every morning the woman crept to the little stable, and\r\ncried: \xe2\x80\x98Hansel, stretch out your finger that I may feel if you will soon\r\nbe fat.\xe2\x80\x99 Hansel, however, stretched out a little bone to her, and\r\nthe old woman, who had dim eyes, could not see it, and thought it was\r\nHansel\xe2\x80\x99s finger, and was astonished that there was no way of fattening\r\nhim. When four weeks had gone by, and Hansel still remained thin, she\r\nwas seized with impatience and would not wait any longer. \xe2\x80\x98Now, then,\r\nGretel,\xe2\x80\x99 she cried to the girl, \xe2\x80\x98stir yourself, and bring some water.\r\nLet Hansel be fat or lean, tomorrow I will kill him, and cook him.\xe2\x80\x99 Ah,\r\nhow the poor little sister did lament when she had to fetch the water,\r\nand how her tears did flow down her cheeks! \xe2\x80\x98Dear God, do help us,\xe2\x80\x99 she\r\ncried. \xe2\x80\x98If the wild beasts in the forest had but devoured us, we should\r\nat any rate have died together.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Just keep your noise to yourself,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsaid the old woman, \xe2\x80\x98it won\xe2\x80\x99t help you at all.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nEarly in the morning, Gretel had to go out and hang up the cauldron with\r\nthe water, and light the fire. \xe2\x80\x98We will bake first,\xe2\x80\x99 said the old woman,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have already heated the oven, and kneaded the dough.\xe2\x80\x99 She pushed poor\r\nGretel out to the oven, from which flames of fire were already darting.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Creep in,\xe2\x80\x99 said the witch, \xe2\x80\x98and see if it is properly heated, so that\r\nwe can put the bread in.\xe2\x80\x99 And once Gretel was inside, she intended to\r\nshut the oven and let her bake in it, and then she would eat her, too.\r\nBut Gretel saw what she had in mind, and said: \xe2\x80\x98I do not know how I am\r\nto do it; how do I get in?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Silly goose,\xe2\x80\x99 said the old woman. \xe2\x80\x98The door\r\nis big enough; just look, I can get in myself!\xe2\x80\x99 and she crept up and\r\nthrust her head into the oven. Then Gretel gave her a push that drove\r\nher far into it, and shut the iron door, and fastened the bolt. Oh! then\r\nshe began to howl quite horribly, but Gretel ran away and the godless\r\nwitch was miserably burnt to death.\r\n\r\nGretel, however, ran like lightning to Hansel, opened his little stable,\r\nand cried: \xe2\x80\x98Hansel, we are saved! The old witch is dead!\xe2\x80\x99 Then Hansel\r\nsprang like a bird from its cage when the door is opened. How they did\r\nrejoice and embrace each other, and dance about and kiss each other! And\r\nas they had no longer any need to fear her, they went into the witch\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhouse, and in every corner there stood chests full of pearls and jewels.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98These are far better than pebbles!\xe2\x80\x99 said Hansel, and thrust into his\r\npockets whatever could be got in, and Gretel said: \xe2\x80\x98I, too, will take\r\nsomething home with me,\xe2\x80\x99 and filled her pinafore full. \xe2\x80\x98But now we must\r\nbe off,\xe2\x80\x99 said Hansel, \xe2\x80\x98that we may get out of the witch\xe2\x80\x99s forest.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWhen they had walked for two hours, they came to a great stretch of\r\nwater. \xe2\x80\x98We cannot cross,\xe2\x80\x99 said Hansel, \xe2\x80\x98I see no foot-plank, and no\r\nbridge.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98And there is also no ferry,\xe2\x80\x99 answered Gretel, \xe2\x80\x98but a white\r\nduck is swimming there: if I ask her, she will help us over.\xe2\x80\x99 Then she\r\ncried:\r\n\r\n \xe2\x80\x98Little duck, little duck, dost thou see,\r\n  Hansel and Gretel are waiting for thee?\r\n  There\xe2\x80\x99s never a plank, or bridge in sight,\r\n  Take us across on thy back so white.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe duck came to them, and Hansel seated himself on its back, and told\r\nhis sister to sit by him. \xe2\x80\x98No,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Gretel, \xe2\x80\x98that will be too heavy\r\nfor the little duck; she shall take us across, one after the other.\xe2\x80\x99 The\r\ngood little duck did so, and when they were once safely across and had\r\nwalked for a short time, the forest seemed to be more and more familiar\r\nto them, and at length they saw from afar their father\xe2\x80\x99s house. Then\r\nthey began to run, rushed into the parlour, and threw themselves round\r\ntheir father\xe2\x80\x99s neck. The man had not known one happy hour since he had\r\nleft the children in the forest; the woman, however, was dead. Gretel\r\nemptied her pinafore until pearls and precious stones ran about the\r\nroom, and Hansel threw one handful after another out of his pocket to\r\nadd to them. Then all anxiety was at an end, and they lived together\r\nin perfect happiness. My tale is done, there runs a mouse; whosoever\r\ncatches it, may make himself a big fur cap out of it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MOUSE, THE BIRD, AND THE SAUSAGE\r\n\r\nOnce upon a time, a mouse, a bird, and a sausage, entered into\r\npartnership and set up house together. For a long time all went well;\r\nthey lived in great comfort, and prospered so far as to be able to add\r\nconsiderably to their stores. The bird\xe2\x80\x99s duty was to fly daily into the\r\nwood and bring in fuel; the mouse fetched the water, and the sausage saw\r\nto the cooking.\r\n\r\nWhen people are too well off they always begin to long for something\r\nnew. And so it came to pass, that the bird, while out one day, met a\r\nfellow bird, to whom he boastfully expatiated on the excellence of his\r\nhousehold arrangements. But the other bird sneered at him for being a\r\npoor simpleton, who did all the hard work, while the other two stayed\r\nat home and had a good time of it. For, when the mouse had made the fire\r\nand fetched in the water, she could retire into her little room and rest\r\nuntil it was time to set the table. The sausage had only to watch the\r\npot to see that the food was properly cooked, and when it was near\r\ndinner-time, he just threw himself into the broth, or rolled in and out\r\namong the vegetables three or four times, and there they were, buttered,\r\nand salted, and ready to be served. Then, when the bird came home and\r\nhad laid aside his burden, they sat down to table, and when they had\r\nfinished their meal, they could sleep their fill till the following\r\nmorning: and that was really a very delightful life.\r\n\r\nInfluenced by those remarks, the bird next morning refused to bring in\r\nthe wood, telling the others that he had been their servant long enough,\r\nand had been a fool into the bargain, and that it was now time to make a\r\nchange, and to try some other way of arranging the work. Beg and pray\r\nas the mouse and the sausage might, it was of no use; the bird remained\r\nmaster of the situation, and the venture had to be made. They therefore\r\ndrew lots, and it fell to the sausage to bring in the wood, to the mouse\r\nto cook, and to the bird to fetch the water.\r\n\r\nAnd now what happened? The sausage started in search of wood, the bird\r\nmade the fire, and the mouse put on the pot, and then these two waited\r\ntill the sausage returned with the fuel for the following day. But the\r\nsausage remained so long away, that they became uneasy, and the bird\r\nflew out to meet him. He had not flown far, however, when he came across\r\na dog who, having met the sausage, had regarded him as his legitimate\r\nbooty, and so seized and swallowed him. The bird complained to the dog\r\nof this bare-faced robbery, but nothing he said was of any avail, for\r\nthe dog answered that he found false credentials on the sausage, and\r\nthat was the reason his life had been forfeited.\r\n\r\nHe picked up the wood, and flew sadly home, and told the mouse all he\r\nhad seen and heard. They were both very unhappy, but agreed to make the\r\nbest of things and to remain with one another.\r\n\r\nSo now the bird set the table, and the mouse looked after the food and,\r\nwishing to prepare it in the same way as the sausage, by rolling in and\r\nout among the vegetables to salt and butter them, she jumped into the\r\npot; but she stopped short long before she reached the bottom, having\r\nalready parted not only with her skin and hair, but also with life.\r\n\r\nPresently the bird came in and wanted to serve up the dinner, but he\r\ncould nowhere see the cook. In his alarm and flurry, he threw the wood\r\nhere and there about the floor, called and searched, but no cook was to\r\nbe found. Then some of the wood that had been carelessly thrown down,\r\ncaught fire and began to blaze. The bird hastened to fetch some water,\r\nbut his pail fell into the well, and he after it, and as he was unable\r\nto recover himself, he was drowned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMOTHER HOLLE\r\n\r\nOnce upon a time there was a widow who had two daughters; one of them\r\nwas beautiful and industrious, the other ugly and lazy. The mother,\r\nhowever, loved the ugly and lazy one best, because she was her own\r\ndaughter, and so the other, who was only her stepdaughter, was made\r\nto do all the work of the house, and was quite the Cinderella of the\r\nfamily. Her stepmother sent her out every day to sit by the well in\r\nthe high road, there to spin until she made her fingers bleed. Now it\r\nchanced one day that some blood fell on to the spindle, and as the girl\r\nstopped over the well to wash it off, the spindle suddenly sprang out\r\nof her hand and fell into the well. She ran home crying to tell of her\r\nmisfortune, but her stepmother spoke harshly to her, and after giving\r\nher a violent scolding, said unkindly, \xe2\x80\x98As you have let the spindle fall\r\ninto the well you may go yourself and fetch it out.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe girl went back to the well not knowing what to do, and at last in\r\nher distress she jumped into the water after the spindle.\r\n\r\nShe remembered nothing more until she awoke and found herself in a\r\nbeautiful meadow, full of sunshine, and with countless flowers blooming\r\nin every direction.\r\n\r\nShe walked over the meadow, and presently she came upon a baker\xe2\x80\x99s oven\r\nfull of bread, and the loaves cried out to her, \xe2\x80\x98Take us out, take us\r\nout, or alas! we shall be burnt to a cinder; we were baked through long\r\nago.\xe2\x80\x99 So she took the bread-shovel and drew them all out.\r\n\r\nShe went on a little farther, till she came to a tree full of apples.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Shake me, shake me, I pray,\xe2\x80\x99 cried the tree; \xe2\x80\x98my apples, one and all,\r\nare ripe.\xe2\x80\x99 So she shook the tree, and the apples came falling down upon\r\nher like rain; but she continued shaking until there was not a single\r\napple left upon it. Then she carefully gathered the apples together in a\r\nheap and walked on again.\r\n\r\nThe next thing she came to was a little house, and there she saw an old\r\nwoman looking out, with such large teeth, that she was terrified, and\r\nturned to run away. But the old woman called after her, \xe2\x80\x98What are you\r\nafraid of, dear child? Stay with me; if you will do the work of my house\r\nproperly for me, I will make you very happy. You must be very careful,\r\nhowever, to make my bed in the right way, for I wish you always to shake\r\nit thoroughly, so that the feathers fly about; then they say, down there\r\nin the world, that it is snowing; for I am Mother Holle.\xe2\x80\x99 The old woman\r\nspoke so kindly, that the girl summoned up courage and agreed to enter\r\ninto her service.\r\n\r\nShe took care to do everything according to the old woman\xe2\x80\x99s bidding and\r\nevery time she made the bed she shook it with all her might, so that the\r\nfeathers flew about like so many snowflakes. The old woman was as good\r\nas her word: she never spoke angrily to her, and gave her roast and\r\nboiled meats every day.\r\n\r\nSo she stayed on with Mother Holle for some time, and then she began\r\nto grow unhappy. She could not at first tell why she felt sad, but she\r\nbecame conscious at last of great longing to go home; then she knew she\r\nwas homesick, although she was a thousand times better off with Mother\r\nHolle than with her mother and sister. After waiting awhile, she went\r\nto Mother Holle and said, \xe2\x80\x98I am so homesick, that I cannot stay with\r\nyou any longer, for although I am so happy here, I must return to my own\r\npeople.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThen Mother Holle said, \xe2\x80\x98I am pleased that you should want to go back\r\nto your own people, and as you have served me so well and faithfully, I\r\nwill take you home myself.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThereupon she led the girl by the hand up to a broad gateway. The gate\r\nwas opened, and as the girl passed through, a shower of gold fell upon\r\nher, and the gold clung to her, so that she was covered with it from\r\nhead to foot.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That is a reward for your industry,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mother Holle, and as she\r\nspoke she handed her the spindle which she had dropped into the well.\r\n\r\nThe gate was then closed, and the girl found herself back in the old\r\nworld close to her mother\xe2\x80\x99s house. As she entered the courtyard, the\r\ncock who was perched on the well, called out:\r\n\r\n \xe2\x80\x98Cock-a-doodle-doo!\r\n  Your golden daughter\xe2\x80\x99s come back to you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThen she went in to her mother and sister, and as she was so richly\r\ncovered with gold, they gave her a warm welcome. She related to them\r\nall that had happened, and when the mother heard how she had come by her\r\ngreat riches, she thought she should like her ugly, lazy daughter to go\r\nand try her fortune. So she made the sister go and sit by the well\r\nand spin, and the girl pricked her finger and thrust her hand into a\r\nthorn-bush, so that she might drop some blood on to the spindle; then\r\nshe threw it into the well, and jumped in herself.\r\n\r\nLike her sister she awoke in the beautiful meadow, and walked over it\r\ntill she came to the oven. \xe2\x80\x98Take us out, take us out, or alas! we shall\r\nbe burnt to a cinder; we were baked through long ago,\xe2\x80\x99 cried the loaves\r\nas before. But the lazy girl answered, \xe2\x80\x98Do you think I am going to dirty\r\nmy hands for you?\xe2\x80\x99 and walked on.\r\n\r\nPresently she came to the apple-tree. \xe2\x80\x98Shake me, shake me, I pray; my\r\napples, one and all, are ripe,\xe2\x80\x99 it cried. But she only answered, \xe2\x80\x98A nice\r\nthing to ask me to do, one of the apples might fall on my head,\xe2\x80\x99 and\r\npassed on.\r\n\r\nAt last she came to Mother Holle\xe2\x80\x99s house, and as she had heard all about\r\nthe large teeth from her sister, she was not afraid of them, and engaged\r\nherself without delay to the old woman.\r\n\r\nThe first day she was very obedient and industrious, and exerted herself\r\nto please Mother Holle, for she thought of the gold she should get in\r\nreturn. The next day, however, she began to dawdle over her work, and\r\nthe third day she was more idle still; then she began to lie in bed in\r\nthe mornings and refused to get up. Worse still, she neglected to\r\nmake the old woman\xe2\x80\x99s bed properly, and forgot to shake it so that the\r\nfeathers might fly about. So Mother Holle very soon got tired of her,\r\nand told her she might go. The lazy girl was delighted at this, and\r\nthought to herself, \xe2\x80\x98The gold will soon be mine.\xe2\x80\x99 Mother Holle led her,\r\nas she had led her sister, to the broad gateway; but as she was passing\r\nthrough, instead of the shower of gold, a great bucketful of pitch came\r\npouring over her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That is in return for your services,\xe2\x80\x99 said the old woman, and she shut\r\nthe gate.\r\n\r\nSo the lazy girl had to go home covered with pitch, and the cock on the\r\nwell called out as she saw her:\r\n\r\n \xe2\x80\x98Cock-a-doodle-doo!\r\n  Your dirty daughter\xe2\x80\x99s come back to you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBut, try what she would, she could not get the pitch off and it stuck to\r\nher as long as she lived.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLITTLE RED-CAP [LITTLE RED RIDING HOOD]\r\n\r\nOnce upon a time there was a dear little girl who was loved by everyone\r\nwho looked at her, but most of all by her grandmother, and there was\r\nnothing that she would not have given to the child. Once she gave her a\r\nlittle cap of red velvet, which suited her so well that she would never\r\nwear anything else; so she was always called \xe2\x80\x98Little Red-Cap.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nOne day her mother said to her: \xe2\x80\x98Come, Little Red-Cap, here is a piece\r\nof cake and a bottle of wine; take them to your grandmother, she is ill\r\nand weak, and they will do her good. Set out before it gets hot, and\r\nwhen you are going, walk nicely and quietly and do not run off the path,\r\nor you may fall and break the bottle, and then your grandmother will\r\nget nothing; and when you go into her room, don\xe2\x80\x99t forget to say, \xe2\x80\x9cGood\r\nmorning\xe2\x80\x9d, and don\xe2\x80\x99t peep into every corner before you do it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I will take great care,\xe2\x80\x99 said Little Red-Cap to her mother, and gave\r\nher hand on it.\r\n\r\nThe grandmother lived out in the wood, half a league from the village,\r\nand just as Little Red-Cap entered the wood, a wolf met her. Red-Cap\r\ndid not know what a wicked creature he was, and was not at all afraid of\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Good day, Little Red-Cap,\xe2\x80\x99 said he.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thank you kindly, wolf.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Whither away so early, Little Red-Cap?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98To my grandmother\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What have you got in your apron?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Cake and wine; yesterday was baking-day, so poor sick grandmother is to\r\nhave something good, to make her stronger.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Where does your grandmother live, Little Red-Cap?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98A good quarter of a league farther on in the wood; her house stands\r\nunder the three large oak-trees, the nut-trees are just below; you\r\nsurely must know it,\xe2\x80\x99 replied Little Red-Cap.\r\n\r\nThe wolf thought to himself: \xe2\x80\x98What a tender young creature! what a nice\r\nplump mouthful--she will be better to eat than the old woman. I must\r\nact craftily, so as to catch both.\xe2\x80\x99 So he walked for a short time by\r\nthe side of Little Red-Cap, and then he said: \xe2\x80\x98See, Little Red-Cap, how\r\npretty the flowers are about here--why do you not look round? I believe,\r\ntoo, that you do not hear how sweetly the little birds are singing; you\r\nwalk gravely along as if you were going to school, while everything else\r\nout here in the wood is merry.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nLittle Red-Cap raised her eyes, and when she saw the sunbeams dancing\r\nhere and there through the trees, and pretty flowers growing everywhere,\r\nshe thought: \xe2\x80\x98Suppose I take grandmother a fresh nosegay; that would\r\nplease her too. It is so early in the day that I shall still get there\r\nin good time\xe2\x80\x99; and so she ran from the path into the wood to look for\r\nflowers. And whenever she had picked one, she fancied that she saw a\r\nstill prettier one farther on, and ran after it, and so got deeper and\r\ndeeper into the wood.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the wolf ran straight to the grandmother\xe2\x80\x99s house and knocked\r\nat the door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Who is there?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Little Red-Cap,\xe2\x80\x99 replied the wolf. \xe2\x80\x98She is bringing cake and wine; open\r\nthe door.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Lift the latch,\xe2\x80\x99 called out the grandmother, \xe2\x80\x98I am too weak, and cannot\r\nget up.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe wolf lifted the latch, the door sprang open, and without saying a\r\nword he went straight to the grandmother\xe2\x80\x99s bed, and devoured her. Then\r\nhe put on her clothes, dressed himself in her cap laid himself in bed\r\nand drew the curtains.\r\n\r\nLittle Red-Cap, however, had been running about picking flowers,\r\nand when she had gathered so many that she could carry no more, she\r\nremembered her grandmother, and set out on the way to her.\r\n\r\nShe was surprised to find the cottage-door standing open, and when she\r\nwent into the room, she had such a strange feeling that she said to\r\nherself: \xe2\x80\x98Oh dear! how uneasy I feel today, and at other times I like\r\nbeing with grandmother so much.\xe2\x80\x99 She called out: \xe2\x80\x98Good morning,\xe2\x80\x99 but\r\nreceived no answer; so she went to the bed and drew back the curtains.\r\nThere lay her grandmother with her cap pulled far over her face, and\r\nlooking very strange.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh! grandmother,\xe2\x80\x99 she said, \xe2\x80\x98what big ears you have!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The better to hear you with, my child,\xe2\x80\x99 was the reply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But, grandmother, what big eyes you have!\xe2\x80\x99 she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The better to see you with, my dear.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98But, grandmother, what large hands you have!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The better to hug you with.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh! but, grandmother, what a terrible big mouth you have!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The better to eat you with!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAnd scarcely had the wolf said this, than with one bound he was out of\r\nbed and swallowed up Red-Cap.\r\n\r\nWhen the wolf had appeased his appetite, he lay down again in the bed,\r\nfell asleep and began to snore very loud. The huntsman was just passing\r\nthe house, and thought to himself: \xe2\x80\x98How the old woman is snoring! I must\r\njust see if she wants anything.\xe2\x80\x99 So he went into the room, and when he\r\ncame to the bed, he saw that the wolf was lying in it. \xe2\x80\x98Do I find you\r\nhere, you old sinner!\xe2\x80\x99 said he. \xe2\x80\x98I have long sought you!\xe2\x80\x99 Then just as\r\nhe was going to fire at him, it occurred to him that the wolf might have\r\ndevoured the grandmother, and that she might still be saved, so he did\r\nnot fire, but took a pair of scissors, and began to cut open the stomach\r\nof the sleeping wolf. When he had made two snips, he saw the little\r\nRed-Cap shining, and then he made two snips more, and the little girl\r\nsprang out, crying: \xe2\x80\x98Ah, how frightened I have been! How dark it was\r\ninside the wolf\xe2\x80\x99; and after that the aged grandmother came out alive\r\nalso, but scarcely able to breathe. Red-Cap, however, quickly fetched\r\ngreat stones with which they filled the wolf\xe2\x80\x99s belly, and when he awoke,\r\nhe wanted to run away, but the stones were so heavy that he collapsed at\r\nonce, and fell dead.\r\n\r\nThen all three were delighted. The huntsman drew off the wolf\xe2\x80\x99s skin and\r\nwent home with it; the grandmother ate the cake and drank the wine which\r\nRed-Cap had brought, and revived, but Red-Cap thought to herself: \xe2\x80\x98As\r\nlong as I live, I will never by myself leave the path, to run into the\r\nwood, when my mother has forbidden me to do so.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt also related that once when Red-Cap was again taking cakes to the old\r\ngrandmother, another wolf spoke to her, and tried to entice her from the\r\npath. Red-Cap, however, was on her guard, and went straight forward on\r\nher way, and told her grandmother that she had met the wolf, and that he\r\nhad said \xe2\x80\x98good morning\xe2\x80\x99 to her, but with such a wicked look in his eyes,\r\nthat if they had not been on the public road she was certain he would\r\nhave eaten her up. \xe2\x80\x98Well,\xe2\x80\x99 said the grandmother, \xe2\x80\x98we will shut the door,\r\nthat he may not come in.\xe2\x80\x99 Soon afterwards the wolf knocked, and cried:\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Open the door, grandmother, I am Little Red-Cap, and am bringing you\r\nsome cakes.\xe2\x80\x99 But they did not speak, or open the door, so the grey-beard\r\nstole twice or thrice round the house, and at last jumped on the roof,\r\nintending to wait until Red-Cap went home in the evening, and then to\r\nsteal after her and devour her in the darkness. But the grandmother\r\nsaw what was in his thoughts. In front of the house was a great stone\r\ntrough, so she said to the child: \xe2\x80\x98Take the pail, Red-Cap; I made some\r\nsausages yesterday, so carry the water in which I boiled them to the\r\ntrough.\xe2\x80\x99 Red-Cap carried until the great trough was quite full. Then the\r\nsmell of the sausages reached the wolf, and he sniffed and peeped down,\r\nand at last stretched out his neck so far that he could no longer keep\r\nhis footing and began to slip, and slipped down from the roof straight\r\ninto the great trough, and was drowned. But Red-Cap went joyously home,\r\nand no one ever did anything to harm her again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ROBBER BRIDEGROOM\r\n\r\nThere was once a miller who had one beautiful daughter, and as she was\r\ngrown up, he was anxious that she should be well married and provided\r\nfor. He said to himself, \xe2\x80\x98I will give her to the first suitable man who\r\ncomes and asks for her hand.\xe2\x80\x99 Not long after a suitor appeared, and as\r\nhe appeared to be very rich and the miller could see nothing in him with\r\nwhich to find fault, he betrothed his daughter to him. But the girl did\r\nnot care for the man as a girl ought to care for her betrothed husband.\r\nShe did not feel that she could trust him, and she could not look at him\r\nnor think of him without an inward shudder. One day he said to her, \xe2\x80\x98You\r\nhave not yet paid me a visit, although we have been betrothed for some\r\ntime.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98I do not know where your house is,\xe2\x80\x99 she answered. \xe2\x80\x98My house is\r\nout there in the dark forest,\xe2\x80\x99 he said. She tried to excuse herself by\r\nsaying that she would not be able to find the way thither. Her betrothed\r\nonly replied, \xe2\x80\x98You must come and see me next Sunday; I have already\r\ninvited guests for that day, and that you may not mistake the way, I\r\nwill strew ashes along the path.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWhen Sunday came, and it was time for the girl to start, a feeling of\r\ndread came over her which she could not explain, and that she might\r\nbe able to find her path again, she filled her pockets with peas and\r\nlentils to sprinkle on the ground as she went along. On reaching the\r\nentrance to the forest she found the path strewed with ashes, and these\r\nshe followed, throwing down some peas on either side of her at every\r\nstep she took. She walked the whole day until she came to the deepest,\r\ndarkest part of the forest. There she saw a lonely house, looking so\r\ngrim and mysterious, that it did not please her at all. She stepped\r\ninside, but not a soul was to be seen, and a great silence reigned\r\nthroughout. Suddenly a voice cried:\r\n\r\n \xe2\x80\x98Turn back, turn back, young maiden fair,\r\n  Linger not in this murderers\xe2\x80\x99 lair.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe girl looked up and saw that the voice came from a bird hanging in a\r\ncage on the wall. Again it cried:\r\n\r\n \xe2\x80\x98Turn back, turn back, young maiden fair,\r\n  Linger not in this murderers\xe2\x80\x99 lair.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe girl passed on, going from room to room of the house, but they were\r\nall empty, and still she saw no one. At last she came to the cellar,\r\nand there sat a very, very old woman, who could not keep her head from\r\nshaking. \xe2\x80\x98Can you tell me,\xe2\x80\x99 asked the girl, \xe2\x80\x98if my betrothed husband\r\nlives here?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah, you poor child,\xe2\x80\x99 answered the old woman, \xe2\x80\x98what a place for you to\r\ncome to! This is a murderers\xe2\x80\x99 den. You think yourself a promised bride,\r\nand that your marriage will soon take place, but it is with death that\r\nyou will keep your marriage feast. Look, do you see that large cauldron\r\nof water which I am obliged to keep on the fire! As soon as they have\r\nyou in their power they will kill you without mercy, and cook and eat\r\nyou, for they are eaters of men. If I did not take pity on you and save\r\nyou, you would be lost.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThereupon the old woman led her behind a large cask, which quite hid her\r\nfrom view. \xe2\x80\x98Keep as still as a mouse,\xe2\x80\x99 she said; \xe2\x80\x98do not move or speak,\r\nor it will be all over with you. Tonight, when the robbers are\r\nall asleep, we will flee together. I have long been waiting for an\r\nopportunity to escape.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe words were hardly out of her mouth when the godless crew returned,\r\ndragging another young girl along with them. They were all drunk, and\r\npaid no heed to her cries and lamentations. They gave her wine to drink,\r\nthree glasses full, one of white wine, one of red, and one of yellow,\r\nand with that her heart gave way and she died. Then they tore off her\r\ndainty clothing, laid her on a table, and cut her beautiful body into\r\npieces, and sprinkled salt upon it.\r\n\r\nThe poor betrothed girl crouched trembling and shuddering behind the\r\ncask, for she saw what a terrible fate had been intended for her by\r\nthe robbers. One of them now noticed a gold ring still remaining on\r\nthe little finger of the murdered girl, and as he could not draw it off\r\neasily, he took a hatchet and cut off the finger; but the finger sprang\r\ninto the air, and fell behind the cask into the lap of the girl who was\r\nhiding there. The robber took a light and began looking for it, but he\r\ncould not find it. \xe2\x80\x98Have you looked behind the large cask?\xe2\x80\x99 said one of\r\nthe others. But the old woman called out, \xe2\x80\x98Come and eat your suppers,\r\nand let the thing be till tomorrow; the finger won\xe2\x80\x99t run away.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The old woman is right,\xe2\x80\x99 said the robbers, and they ceased looking for\r\nthe finger and sat down.\r\n\r\nThe old woman then mixed a sleeping draught with their wine, and before\r\nlong they were all lying on the floor of the cellar, fast asleep and\r\nsnoring. As soon as the girl was assured of this, she came from behind\r\nthe cask. She was obliged to step over the bodies of the sleepers, who\r\nwere lying close together, and every moment she was filled with renewed\r\ndread lest she should awaken them. But God helped her, so that she\r\npassed safely over them, and then she and the old woman went upstairs,\r\nopened the door, and hastened as fast as they could from the murderers\xe2\x80\x99\r\nden. They found the ashes scattered by the wind, but the peas and\r\nlentils had sprouted, and grown sufficiently above the ground, to guide\r\nthem in the moonlight along the path. All night long they walked, and it\r\nwas morning before they reached the mill. Then the girl told her father\r\nall that had happened.\r\n\r\nThe day came that had been fixed for the marriage. The bridegroom\r\narrived and also a large company of guests, for the miller had taken\r\ncare to invite all his friends and relations. As they sat at the feast,\r\neach guest in turn was asked to tell a tale; the bride sat still and did\r\nnot say a word.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And you, my love,\xe2\x80\x99 said the bridegroom, turning to her, \xe2\x80\x98is there no\r\ntale you know? Tell us something.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I will tell you a dream, then,\xe2\x80\x99 said the bride. \xe2\x80\x98I went alone through a\r\nforest and came at last to a house; not a soul could I find within, but\r\na bird that was hanging in a cage on the wall cried:\r\n\r\n \xe2\x80\x98Turn back, turn back, young maiden fair,\r\n  Linger not in this murderers\xe2\x80\x99 lair.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nand again a second time it said these words.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My darling, this is only a dream.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I went on through the house from room to room, but they were all empty,\r\nand everything was so grim and mysterious. At last I went down to the\r\ncellar, and there sat a very, very old woman, who could not keep her\r\nhead still. I asked her if my betrothed lived here, and she answered,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, you poor child, you are come to a murderers\xe2\x80\x99 den; your betrothed\r\ndoes indeed live here, but he will kill you without mercy and afterwards\r\ncook and eat you.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My darling, this is only a dream.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The old woman hid me behind a large cask, and scarcely had she done\r\nthis when the robbers returned home, dragging a young girl along with\r\nthem. They gave her three kinds of wine to drink, white, red, and\r\nyellow, and with that she died.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My darling, this is only a dream.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then they tore off her dainty clothing, and cut her beautiful body into\r\npieces and sprinkled salt upon it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My darling, this is only a dream.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And one of the robbers saw that there was a gold ring still left on her\r\nfinger, and as it was difficult to draw off, he took a hatchet and cut\r\noff her finger; but the finger sprang into the air and fell behind the\r\ngreat cask into my lap. And here is the finger with the ring.\xe2\x80\x99 And\r\nwith these words the bride drew forth the finger and shewed it to the\r\nassembled guests.\r\n\r\nThe bridegroom, who during this recital had grown deadly pale, up and\r\ntried to escape, but the guests seized him and held him fast. They\r\ndelivered him up to justice, and he and all his murderous band were\r\ncondemned to death for their wicked deeds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTOM THUMB\r\n\r\nA poor woodman sat in his cottage one night, smoking his pipe by the\r\nfireside, while his wife sat by his side spinning. \xe2\x80\x98How lonely it is,\r\nwife,\xe2\x80\x99 said he, as he puffed out a long curl of smoke, \xe2\x80\x98for you and me\r\nto sit here by ourselves, without any children to play about and amuse\r\nus while other people seem so happy and merry with their children!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What you say is very true,\xe2\x80\x99 said the wife, sighing, and turning round\r\nher wheel; \xe2\x80\x98how happy should I be if I had but one child! If it were\r\never so small--nay, if it were no bigger than my thumb--I should be very\r\nhappy, and love it dearly.\xe2\x80\x99 Now--odd as you may think it--it came to\r\npass that this good woman\xe2\x80\x99s wish was fulfilled, just in the very way she\r\nhad wished it; for, not long afterwards, she had a little boy, who was\r\nquite healthy and strong, but was not much bigger than my thumb. So\r\nthey said, \xe2\x80\x98Well, we cannot say we have not got what we wished for, and,\r\nlittle as he is, we will love him dearly.\xe2\x80\x99 And they called him Thomas\r\nThumb.\r\n\r\nThey gave him plenty of food, yet for all they could do he never grew\r\nbigger, but kept just the same size as he had been when he was born.\r\nStill, his eyes were sharp and sparkling, and he soon showed himself to\r\nbe a clever little fellow, who always knew well what he was about.\r\n\r\nOne day, as the woodman was getting ready to go into the wood to cut\r\nfuel, he said, \xe2\x80\x98I wish I had someone to bring the cart after me, for I\r\nwant to make haste.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Oh, father,\xe2\x80\x99 cried Tom, \xe2\x80\x98I will take care of that;\r\nthe cart shall be in the wood by the time you want it.\xe2\x80\x99 Then the woodman\r\nlaughed, and said, \xe2\x80\x98How can that be? you cannot reach up to the horse\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbridle.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Never mind that, father,\xe2\x80\x99 said Tom; \xe2\x80\x98if my mother will only\r\nharness the horse, I will get into his ear and tell him which way to\r\ngo.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Well,\xe2\x80\x99 said the father, \xe2\x80\x98we will try for once.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWhen the time came the mother harnessed the horse to the cart, and put\r\nTom into his ear; and as he sat there the little man told the beast how\r\nto go, crying out, \xe2\x80\x98Go on!\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98Stop!\xe2\x80\x99 as he wanted: and thus the horse\r\nwent on just as well as if the woodman had driven it himself into the\r\nwood. It happened that as the horse was going a little too fast, and Tom\r\nwas calling out, \xe2\x80\x98Gently! gently!\xe2\x80\x99 two strangers came up. \xe2\x80\x98What an odd\r\nthing that is!\xe2\x80\x99 said one: \xe2\x80\x98there is a cart going along, and I hear a\r\ncarter talking to the horse, but yet I can see no one.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98That is queer,\r\nindeed,\xe2\x80\x99 said the other; \xe2\x80\x98let us follow the cart, and see where it\r\ngoes.\xe2\x80\x99 So they went on into the wood, till at last they came to the\r\nplace where the woodman was. Then Tom Thumb, seeing his father, cried\r\nout, \xe2\x80\x98See, father, here I am with the cart, all right and safe! now take\r\nme down!\xe2\x80\x99 So his father took hold of the horse with one hand, and with\r\nthe other took his son out of the horse\xe2\x80\x99s ear, and put him down upon a\r\nstraw, where he sat as merry as you please.\r\n\r\nThe two strangers were all this time looking on, and did not know what\r\nto say for wonder. At last one took the other aside, and said, \xe2\x80\x98That\r\nlittle urchin will make our fortune, if we can get him, and carry him\r\nabout from town to town as a show; we must buy him.\xe2\x80\x99 So they went up to\r\nthe woodman, and asked him what he would take for the little man. \xe2\x80\x98He\r\nwill be better off,\xe2\x80\x99 said they, \xe2\x80\x98with us than with you.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98I won\xe2\x80\x99t sell\r\nhim at all,\xe2\x80\x99 said the father; \xe2\x80\x98my own flesh and blood is dearer to me\r\nthan all the silver and gold in the world.\xe2\x80\x99 But Tom, hearing of the\r\nbargain they wanted to make, crept up his father\xe2\x80\x99s coat to his shoulder\r\nand whispered in his ear, \xe2\x80\x98Take the money, father, and let them have me;\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll soon come back to you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSo the woodman at last said he would sell Tom to the strangers for a\r\nlarge piece of gold, and they paid the price. \xe2\x80\x98Where would you like to\r\nsit?\xe2\x80\x99 said one of them. \xe2\x80\x98Oh, put me on the rim of your hat; that will be\r\na nice gallery for me; I can walk about there and see the country as we\r\ngo along.\xe2\x80\x99 So they did as he wished; and when Tom had taken leave of his\r\nfather they took him away with them.\r\n\r\nThey journeyed on till it began to be dusky, and then the little man\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x98Let me get down, I\xe2\x80\x99m tired.\xe2\x80\x99 So the man took off his hat, and\r\nput him down on a clod of earth, in a ploughed field by the side of the\r\nroad. But Tom ran about amongst the furrows, and at last slipped into\r\nan old mouse-hole. \xe2\x80\x98Good night, my masters!\xe2\x80\x99 said he, \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m off! mind and\r\nlook sharp after me the next time.\xe2\x80\x99 Then they ran at once to the place,\r\nand poked the ends of their sticks into the mouse-hole, but all in vain;\r\nTom only crawled farther and farther in; and at last it became quite\r\ndark, so that they were forced to go their way without their prize, as\r\nsulky as could be.\r\n\r\nWhen Tom found they were gone, he came out of his hiding-place. \xe2\x80\x98What\r\ndangerous walking it is,\xe2\x80\x99 said he, \xe2\x80\x98in this ploughed field! If I were to\r\nfall from one of these great clods, I should undoubtedly break my neck.\xe2\x80\x99\r\nAt last, by good luck, he found a large empty snail-shell. \xe2\x80\x98This is\r\nlucky,\xe2\x80\x99 said he, \xe2\x80\x98I can sleep here very well\xe2\x80\x99; and in he crept.\r\n\r\nJust as he was falling asleep, he heard two men passing by, chatting\r\ntogether; and one said to the other, \xe2\x80\x98How can we rob that rich parson\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhouse of his silver and gold?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you!\xe2\x80\x99 cried Tom. \xe2\x80\x98What noise\r\nwas that?\xe2\x80\x99 said the thief, frightened; \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m sure I heard someone speak.\xe2\x80\x99\r\nThey stood still listening, and Tom said, \xe2\x80\x98Take me with you, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nsoon show you how to get the parson\xe2\x80\x99s money.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98But where are you?\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nthey. \xe2\x80\x98Look about on the ground,\xe2\x80\x99 answered he, \xe2\x80\x98and listen where the\r\nsound comes from.\xe2\x80\x99 At last the thieves found him out, and lifted him\r\nup in their hands. \xe2\x80\x98You little urchin!\xe2\x80\x99 they said, \xe2\x80\x98what can you do for\r\nus?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Why, I can get between the iron window-bars of the parson\xe2\x80\x99s house,\r\nand throw you out whatever you want.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s a good thought,\xe2\x80\x99 said the\r\nthieves; \xe2\x80\x98come along, we shall see what you can do.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWhen they came to the parson\xe2\x80\x99s house, Tom slipped through the\r\nwindow-bars into the room, and then called out as loud as he could bawl,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Will you have all that is here?\xe2\x80\x99 At this the thieves were frightened,\r\nand said, \xe2\x80\x98Softly, softly! Speak low, that you may not awaken anybody.\xe2\x80\x99\r\nBut Tom seemed as if he did not understand them, and bawled out again,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How much will you have? Shall I throw it all out?\xe2\x80\x99 Now the cook lay in\r\nthe next room; and hearing a noise she raised herself up in her bed and\r\nlistened. Meantime the thieves were frightened, and ran off a little\r\nway; but at last they plucked up their hearts, and said, \xe2\x80\x98The little\r\nurchin is only trying to make fools of us.\xe2\x80\x99 So they came back and\r\nwhispered softly to him, saying, \xe2\x80\x98Now let us have no more of your\r\nroguish jokes; but throw us out some of the money.\xe2\x80\x99 Then Tom called out\r\nas loud as he could, \xe2\x80\x98Very well! hold your hands! here it comes.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe cook heard this quite plain, so she sprang out of bed, and ran to\r\nopen the door. The thieves ran off as if a wolf was at their tails: and\r\nthe maid, having groped about and found nothing, went away for a light.\r\nBy the time she came back, Tom had slipped off into the barn; and when\r\nshe had looked about and searched every hole and corner, and found\r\nnobody, she went to bed, thinking she must have been dreaming with her\r\neyes open.\r\n\r\nThe little man crawled about in the hay-loft, and at last found a snug\r\nplace to finish his night\xe2\x80\x99s rest in; so he laid himself down, meaning\r\nto sleep till daylight, and then find his way home to his father and\r\nmother. But alas! how woefully he was undone! what crosses and sorrows\r\nhappen to us all in this world! The cook got up early, before daybreak,\r\nto feed the cows; and going straight to the hay-loft, carried away\r\na large bundle of hay, with the little man in the middle of it, fast\r\nasleep. He still, however, slept on, and did not awake till he found\r\nhimself in the mouth of the cow; for the cook had put the hay into the\r\ncow\xe2\x80\x99s rick, and the cow had taken Tom up in a mouthful of it. \xe2\x80\x98Good\r\nlack-a-day!\xe2\x80\x99 said he, \xe2\x80\x98how came I to tumble into the mill?\xe2\x80\x99 But he soon\r\nfound out where he really was; and was forced to have all his wits about\r\nhim, that he might not get between the cow\xe2\x80\x99s teeth, and so be crushed to\r\ndeath. At last down he went into her stomach. \xe2\x80\x98It is rather dark,\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nhe; \xe2\x80\x98they forgot to build windows in this room to let the sun in; a\r\ncandle would be no bad thing.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThough he made the best of his bad luck, he did not like his quarters at\r\nall; and the worst of it was, that more and more hay was always coming\r\ndown, and the space left for him became smaller and smaller. At last he\r\ncried out as loud as he could, \xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t bring me any more hay! Don\xe2\x80\x99t bring\r\nme any more hay!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe maid happened to be just then milking the cow; and hearing someone\r\nspeak, but seeing nobody, and yet being quite sure it was the same voice\r\nthat she had heard in the night, she was so frightened that she fell off\r\nher stool, and overset the milk-pail. As soon as she could pick herself\r\nup out of the dirt, she ran off as fast as she could to her master the\r\nparson, and said, \xe2\x80\x98Sir, sir, the cow is talking!\xe2\x80\x99 But the parson\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x98Woman, thou art surely mad!\xe2\x80\x99 However, he went with her into the\r\ncow-house, to try and see what was the matter.\r\n\r\nScarcely had they set foot on the threshold, when Tom called out, \xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nbring me any more hay!\xe2\x80\x99 Then the parson himself was frightened; and\r\nthinking the cow was surely bewitched, told his man to kill her on the\r\nspot. So the cow was killed, and cut up; and the stomach, in which Tom\r\nlay, was thrown out upon a dunghill.\r\n\r\nTom soon set himself to work to get out, which was not a very easy\r\ntask; but at last, just as he had made room to get his head out, fresh\r\nill-luck befell him. A hungry wolf sprang out, and swallowed up the\r\nwhole stomach, with Tom in it, at one gulp, and ran away.\r\n\r\nTom, however, was still not disheartened; and thinking the wolf would\r\nnot dislike having some chat with him as he was going along, he called\r\nout, \xe2\x80\x98My good friend, I can show you a famous treat.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Where\xe2\x80\x99s that?\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsaid the wolf. \xe2\x80\x98In such and such a house,\xe2\x80\x99 said Tom, describing his own\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s house. \xe2\x80\x98You can crawl through the drain into the kitchen and\r\nthen into the pantry, and there you will find cakes, ham, beef, cold\r\nchicken, roast pig, apple-dumplings, and everything that your heart can\r\nwish.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe wolf did not want to be asked twice; so that very night he went to\r\nthe house and crawled through the drain into the kitchen, and then into\r\nthe pantry, and ate and drank there to his heart\xe2\x80\x99s content. As soon as\r\nhe had had enough he wanted to get away; but he had eaten so much that\r\nhe could not go out by the same way he came in.\r\n\r\nThis was just what Tom had reckoned upon; and now he began to set up a\r\ngreat shout, making all the noise he could. \xe2\x80\x98Will you be easy?\xe2\x80\x99 said the\r\nwolf; \xe2\x80\x98you\xe2\x80\x99ll awaken everybody in the house if you make such a clatter.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What\xe2\x80\x99s that to me?\xe2\x80\x99 said the little man; \xe2\x80\x98you have had your frolic, now\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve a mind to be merry myself\xe2\x80\x99; and he began, singing and shouting as\r\nloud as he could.\r\n\r\nThe woodman and his wife, being awakened by the noise, peeped through\r\na crack in the door; but when they saw a wolf was there, you may well\r\nsuppose that they were sadly frightened; and the woodman ran for his\r\naxe, and gave his wife a scythe. \xe2\x80\x98Do you stay behind,\xe2\x80\x99 said the woodman,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98and when I have knocked him on the head you must rip him up with the\r\nscythe.\xe2\x80\x99 Tom heard all this, and cried out, \xe2\x80\x98Father, father! I am here,\r\nthe wolf has swallowed me.\xe2\x80\x99 And his father said, \xe2\x80\x98Heaven be praised! we\r\nhave found our dear child again\xe2\x80\x99; and he told his wife not to use the\r\nscythe for fear she should hurt him. Then he aimed a great blow, and\r\nstruck the wolf on the head, and killed him on the spot! and when he was\r\ndead they cut open his body, and set Tommy free. \xe2\x80\x98Ah!\xe2\x80\x99 said the father,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98what fears we have had for you!\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Yes, father,\xe2\x80\x99 answered he; \xe2\x80\x98I have\r\ntravelled all over the world, I think, in one way or other, since we\r\nparted; and now I am very glad to come home and get fresh air again.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Why, where have you been?\xe2\x80\x99 said his father. \xe2\x80\x98I have been in a\r\nmouse-hole--and in a snail-shell--and down a cow\xe2\x80\x99s throat--and in the\r\nwolf\xe2\x80\x99s belly; and yet here I am again, safe and sound.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well,\xe2\x80\x99 said they, \xe2\x80\x98you are come back, and we will not sell you again\r\nfor all the riches in the world.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThen they hugged and kissed their dear little son, and gave him plenty\r\nto eat and drink, for he was very hungry; and then they fetched new\r\nclothes for him, for his old ones had been quite spoiled on his journey.\r\nSo Master Thumb stayed at home with his father and mother, in peace; for\r\nthough he had been so great a traveller, and had done and seen so many\r\nfine things, and was fond enough of telling the whole story, he always\r\nagreed that, after all, there\xe2\x80\x99s no place like HOME!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRUMPELSTILTSKIN\r\n\r\nBy the side of a wood, in a country a long way off, ran a fine stream\r\nof water; and upon the stream there stood a mill. The miller\xe2\x80\x99s house was\r\nclose by, and the miller, you must know, had a very beautiful daughter.\r\nShe was, moreover, very shrewd and clever; and the miller was so proud\r\nof her, that he one day told the king of the land, who used to come and\r\nhunt in the wood, that his daughter could spin gold out of straw. Now\r\nthis king was very fond of money; and when he heard the miller\xe2\x80\x99s boast\r\nhis greediness was raised, and he sent for the girl to be brought before\r\nhim. Then he led her to a chamber in his palace where there was a great\r\nheap of straw, and gave her a spinning-wheel, and said, \xe2\x80\x98All this must\r\nbe spun into gold before morning, as you love your life.\xe2\x80\x99 It was in vain\r\nthat the poor maiden said that it was only a silly boast of her father,\r\nfor that she could do no such thing as spin straw into gold: the chamber\r\ndoor was locked, and she was left alone.\r\n\r\nShe sat down in one corner of the room, and began to bewail her hard\r\nfate; when on a sudden the door opened, and a droll-looking little man\r\nhobbled in, and said, \xe2\x80\x98Good morrow to you, my good lass; what are you\r\nweeping for?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Alas!\xe2\x80\x99 said she, \xe2\x80\x98I must spin this straw into gold, and\r\nI know not how.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98What will you give me,\xe2\x80\x99 said the hobgoblin, \xe2\x80\x98to do it\r\nfor you?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98My necklace,\xe2\x80\x99 replied the maiden. He took her at her word,\r\nand sat himself down to the wheel, and whistled and sang:\r\n\r\n \xe2\x80\x98Round about, round about,\r\n    Lo and behold!\r\n  Reel away, reel away,\r\n    Straw into gold!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAnd round about the wheel went merrily; the work was quickly done, and\r\nthe straw was all spun into gold.\r\n\r\nWhen the king came and saw this, he was greatly astonished and pleased;\r\nbut his heart grew still more greedy of gain, and he shut up the poor\r\nmiller\xe2\x80\x99s daughter again with a fresh task. Then she knew not what to do,\r\nand sat down once more to weep; but the dwarf soon opened the door, and\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x98What will you give me to do your task?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98The ring on my finger,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsaid she. So her little friend took the ring, and began to work at the\r\nwheel again, and whistled and sang:\r\n\r\n \xe2\x80\x98Round about, round about,\r\n    Lo and behold!\r\n  Reel away, reel away,\r\n    Straw into gold!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\ntill, long before morning, all was done again.\r\n\r\nThe king was greatly delighted to see all this glittering treasure;\r\nbut still he had not enough: so he took the miller\xe2\x80\x99s daughter to a yet\r\nlarger heap, and said, \xe2\x80\x98All this must be spun tonight; and if it is,\r\nyou shall be my queen.\xe2\x80\x99 As soon as she was alone that dwarf came in, and\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x98What will you give me to spin gold for you this third time?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have nothing left,\xe2\x80\x99 said she. \xe2\x80\x98Then say you will give me,\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nthe little man, \xe2\x80\x98the first little child that you may have when you are\r\nqueen.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98That may never be,\xe2\x80\x99 thought the miller\xe2\x80\x99s daughter: and as she\r\nknew no other way to get her task done, she said she would do what he\r\nasked. Round went the wheel again to the old song, and the manikin once\r\nmore spun the heap into gold. The king came in the morning, and, finding\r\nall he wanted, was forced to keep his word; so he married the miller\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndaughter, and she really became queen.\r\n\r\nAt the birth of her first little child she was very glad, and forgot the\r\ndwarf, and what she had said. But one day he came into her room, where\r\nshe was sitting playing with her baby, and put her in mind of it. Then\r\nshe grieved sorely at her misfortune, and said she would give him all\r\nthe wealth of the kingdom if he would let her off, but in vain; till at\r\nlast her tears softened him, and he said, \xe2\x80\x98I will give you three days\xe2\x80\x99\r\ngrace, and if during that time you tell me my name, you shall keep your\r\nchild.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nNow the queen lay awake all night, thinking of all the odd names that\r\nshe had ever heard; and she sent messengers all over the land to find\r\nout new ones. The next day the little man came, and she began with\r\nTIMOTHY, ICHABOD, BENJAMIN, JEREMIAH, and all the names she could\r\nremember; but to all and each of them he said, \xe2\x80\x98Madam, that is not my\r\nname.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe second day she began with all the comical names she could hear of,\r\nBANDY-LEGS, HUNCHBACK, CROOK-SHANKS, and so on; but the little gentleman\r\nstill said to every one of them, \xe2\x80\x98Madam, that is not my name.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe third day one of the messengers came back, and said, \xe2\x80\x98I have\r\ntravelled two days without hearing of any other names; but yesterday, as\r\nI was climbing a high hill, among the trees of the forest where the fox\r\nand the hare bid each other good night, I saw a little hut; and before\r\nthe hut burnt a fire; and round about the fire a funny little dwarf was\r\ndancing upon one leg, and singing:\r\n\r\n \xe2\x80\x9cMerrily the feast I\xe2\x80\x99ll make.\r\n  Today I\xe2\x80\x99ll brew, tomorrow bake;\r\n  Merrily I\xe2\x80\x99ll dance and sing,\r\n  For next day will a stranger bring.\r\n  Little does my lady dream\r\n  Rumpelstiltskin is my name!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen the queen heard this she jumped for joy, and as soon as her little\r\nfriend came she sat down upon her throne, and called all her court round\r\nto enjoy the fun; and the nurse stood by her side with the baby in her\r\narms, as if it was quite ready to be given up. Then the little man began\r\nto chuckle at the thought of having the poor child, to take home with\r\nhim to his hut in the woods; and he cried out, \xe2\x80\x98Now, lady, what is my\r\nname?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Is it JOHN?\xe2\x80\x99 asked she. \xe2\x80\x98No, madam!\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Is it TOM?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98No, madam!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Is it JEMMY?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98It is not.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Can your name be RUMPELSTILTSKIN?\xe2\x80\x99 said the\r\nlady slyly. \xe2\x80\x98Some witch told you that!--some witch told you that!\xe2\x80\x99 cried\r\nthe little man, and dashed his right foot in a rage so deep into the\r\nfloor, that he was forced to lay hold of it with both hands to pull it\r\nout.\r\n\r\nThen he made the best of his way off, while the nurse laughed and the\r\nbaby crowed; and all the court jeered at him for having had so much\r\ntrouble for nothing, and said, \xe2\x80\x98We wish you a very good morning, and a\r\nmerry feast, Mr RUMPLESTILTSKIN!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCLEVER GRETEL\r\n\r\nThere was once a cook named Gretel, who wore shoes with red heels, and\r\nwhen she walked out with them on, she turned herself this way and that,\r\nwas quite happy and thought: \xe2\x80\x98You certainly are a pretty girl!\xe2\x80\x99 And when\r\nshe came home she drank, in her gladness of heart, a draught of wine,\r\nand as wine excites a desire to eat, she tasted the best of whatever she\r\nwas cooking until she was satisfied, and said: \xe2\x80\x98The cook must know what\r\nthe food is like.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIt came to pass that the master one day said to her: \xe2\x80\x98Gretel, there is a\r\nguest coming this evening; prepare me two fowls very daintily.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98I will\r\nsee to it, master,\xe2\x80\x99 answered Gretel. She killed two fowls, scalded them,\r\nplucked them, put them on the spit, and towards evening set them before\r\nthe fire, that they might roast. The fowls began to turn brown, and were\r\nnearly ready, but the guest had not yet arrived. Then Gretel called out\r\nto her master: \xe2\x80\x98If the guest does not come, I must take the fowls away\r\nfrom the fire, but it will be a sin and a shame if they are not eaten\r\nthe moment they are at their juiciest.\xe2\x80\x99 The master said: \xe2\x80\x98I will run\r\nmyself, and fetch the guest.\xe2\x80\x99 When the master had turned his back,\r\nGretel laid the spit with the fowls on one side, and thought: \xe2\x80\x98Standing\r\nso long by the fire there, makes one sweat and thirsty; who knows\r\nwhen they will come? Meanwhile, I will run into the cellar, and take a\r\ndrink.\xe2\x80\x99 She ran down, set a jug, said: \xe2\x80\x98God bless it for you, Gretel,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nand took a good drink, and thought that wine should flow on, and should\r\nnot be interrupted, and took yet another hearty draught.\r\n\r\nThen she went and put the fowls down again to the fire, basted them,\r\nand drove the spit merrily round. But as the roast meat smelt so good,\r\nGretel thought: \xe2\x80\x98Something might be wrong, it ought to be tasted!\xe2\x80\x99\r\nShe touched it with her finger, and said: \xe2\x80\x98Ah! how good fowls are! It\r\ncertainly is a sin and a shame that they are not eaten at the right\r\ntime!\xe2\x80\x99 She ran to the window, to see if the master was not coming with\r\nhis guest, but she saw no one, and went back to the fowls and thought:\r\n\xe2\x80\x98One of the wings is burning! I had better take it off and eat it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\nSo she cut it off, ate it, and enjoyed it, and when she had done, she\r\nthought: \xe2\x80\x98The other must go down too, or else master will observe that\r\nsomething is missing.\xe2\x80\x99 When the two wings were eaten, she went and\r\nlooked for her master, and did not see him. It suddenly occurred to\r\nher: \xe2\x80\x98Who knows? They are perhaps not coming at all, and have turned in\r\nsomewhere.\xe2\x80\x99 Then she said: \xe2\x80\x98Well, Gretel, enjoy yourself, one fowl has\r\nbeen cut into, take another drink, and eat it up entirely; when it is\r\neaten you will have some peace, why should God\xe2\x80\x99s good gifts be spoilt?\xe2\x80\x99\r\nSo she ran into the cellar again, took an enormous drink and ate up the\r\none chicken in great glee. When one of the chickens was swallowed down,\r\nand still her master did not come, Gretel looked at the other and said:\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What one is, the other should be likewise, the two go together; what\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nright for the one is right for the other; I think if I were to take\r\nanother draught it would do me no harm.\xe2\x80\x99 So she took another hearty\r\ndrink, and let the second chicken follow the first.\r\n\r\nWhile she was making the most of it, her master came and cried: \xe2\x80\x98Hurry\r\nup, Gretel, the guest is coming directly after me!\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Yes, sir, I will\r\nsoon serve up,\xe2\x80\x99 answered Gretel. Meantime the master looked to see that\r\nthe table was properly laid, and took the great knife, wherewith he was\r\ngoing to carve the chickens, and sharpened it on the steps. Presently\r\nthe guest came, and knocked politely and courteously at the house-door.\r\nGretel ran, and looked to see who was there, and when she saw the guest,\r\nshe put her finger to her lips and said: \xe2\x80\x98Hush! hush! go away as quickly\r\nas you can, if my master catches you it will be the worse for you; he\r\ncertainly did ask you to supper, but his intention is to cut off your\r\ntwo ears. Just listen how he is sharpening the knife for it!\xe2\x80\x99 The guest\r\nheard the sharpening, and hurried down the steps again as fast as he\r\ncould. Gretel was not idle; she ran screaming to her master, and cried:\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You have invited a fine guest!\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Why, Gretel? What do you mean by\r\nthat?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Yes,\xe2\x80\x99 said she, \xe2\x80\x98he has taken the chickens which I was just\r\ngoing to serve up, off the dish, and has run away with them!\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nnice trick!\xe2\x80\x99 said her master, and lamented the fine chickens. \xe2\x80\x98If he had\r\nbut left me one, so that something remained for me to eat.\xe2\x80\x99 He called to\r\nhim to stop, but the guest pretended not to hear. Then he ran after him\r\nwith the knife still in his hand, crying: \xe2\x80\x98Just one, just one,\xe2\x80\x99 meaning\r\nthat the guest should leave him just one chicken, and not take both. The\r\nguest, however, thought no otherwise than that he was to give up one of\r\nhis ears, and ran as if fire were burning under him, in order to take\r\nthem both with him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE OLD MAN AND HIS GRANDSON\r\n\r\nThere was once a very old man, whose eyes had become dim, his ears dull\r\nof hearing, his knees trembled, and when he sat at table he could hardly\r\nhold the spoon, and spilt the broth upon the table-cloth or let it run\r\nout of his mouth. His son and his son\xe2\x80\x99s wife were disgusted at this, so\r\nthe old grandfather at last had to sit in the corner behind the stove,\r\nand they gave him his food in an earthenware bowl, and not even enough\r\nof it. And he used to look towards the table with his eyes full of\r\ntears. Once, too, his trembling hands could not hold the bowl, and it\r\nfell to the ground and broke. The young wife scolded him, but he said\r\nnothing and only sighed. Then they brought him a wooden bowl for a few\r\nhalf-pence, out of which he had to eat.\r\n\r\nThey were once sitting thus when the little grandson of four years old\r\nbegan to gather together some bits of wood upon the ground. \xe2\x80\x98What are\r\nyou doing there?\xe2\x80\x99 asked the father. \xe2\x80\x98I am making a little trough,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nanswered the child, \xe2\x80\x98for father and mother to eat out of when I am big.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe man and his wife looked at each other for a while, and presently\r\nbegan to cry. Then they took the old grandfather to the table, and\r\nhenceforth always let him eat with them, and likewise said nothing if he\r\ndid spill a little of anything.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LITTLE PEASANT\r\n\r\nThere was a certain village wherein no one lived but really rich\r\npeasants, and just one poor one, whom they called the little peasant. He\r\nhad not even so much as a cow, and still less money to buy one, and\r\nyet he and his wife did so wish to have one. One day he said to her:\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Listen, I have a good idea, there is our gossip the carpenter, he shall\r\nmake us a wooden calf, and paint it brown, so that it looks like any\r\nother, and in time it will certainly get big and be a cow.\xe2\x80\x99 the woman\r\nalso liked the idea, and their gossip the carpenter cut and planed\r\nthe calf, and painted it as it ought to be, and made it with its head\r\nhanging down as if it were eating.\r\n\r\nNext morning when the cows were being driven out, the little peasant\r\ncalled the cow-herd in and said: \xe2\x80\x98Look, I have a little calf there,\r\nbut it is still small and has to be carried.\xe2\x80\x99 The cow-herd said: \xe2\x80\x98All\r\nright,\xe2\x80\x99 and took it in his arms and carried it to the pasture, and set\r\nit among the grass. The little calf always remained standing like one\r\nwhich was eating, and the cow-herd said: \xe2\x80\x98It will soon run by itself,\r\njust look how it eats already!\xe2\x80\x99 At night when he was going to drive the\r\nherd home again, he said to the calf: \xe2\x80\x98If you can stand there and eat\r\nyour fill, you can also go on your four legs; I don\xe2\x80\x99t care to drag you\r\nhome again in my arms.\xe2\x80\x99 But the little peasant stood at his door, and\r\nwaited for his little calf, and when the cow-herd drove the cows through\r\nthe village, and the calf was missing, he inquired where it was. The\r\ncow-herd answered: \xe2\x80\x98It is still standing out there eating. It would not\r\nstop and come with us.\xe2\x80\x99 But the little peasant said: \xe2\x80\x98Oh, but I must\r\nhave my beast back again.\xe2\x80\x99 Then they went back to the meadow together,\r\nbut someone had stolen the calf, and it was gone. The cow-herd said: \xe2\x80\x98It\r\nmust have run away.\xe2\x80\x99 The peasant, however, said: \xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t tell me\r\nthat,\xe2\x80\x99 and led the cow-herd before the mayor, who for his carelessness\r\ncondemned him to give the peasant a cow for the calf which had run away.\r\n\r\nAnd now the little peasant and his wife had the cow for which they had\r\nso long wished, and they were heartily glad, but they had no food for\r\nit, and could give it nothing to eat, so it soon had to be killed. They\r\nsalted the flesh, and the peasant went into the town and wanted to sell\r\nthe skin there, so that he might buy a new calf with the proceeds. On\r\nthe way he passed by a mill, and there sat a raven with broken wings,\r\nand out of pity he took him and wrapped him in the skin. But as the\r\nweather grew so bad and there was a storm of rain and wind, he could\r\ngo no farther, and turned back to the mill and begged for shelter. The\r\nmiller\xe2\x80\x99s wife was alone in the house, and said to the peasant: \xe2\x80\x98Lay\r\nyourself on the straw there,\xe2\x80\x99 and gave him a slice of bread and cheese.\r\nThe peasant ate it, and lay down with his skin beside him, and the woman\r\nthought: \xe2\x80\x98He is tired and has gone to sleep.\xe2\x80\x99 In the meantime came the\r\nparson; the miller\xe2\x80\x99s wife received him well, and said: \xe2\x80\x98My husband is\r\nout, so we will have a feast.\xe2\x80\x99 The peasant listened, and when he heard\r\nthem talk about feasting he was vexed that he had been forced to make\r\nshift with a slice of bread and cheese. Then the woman served up four\r\ndifferent things, roast meat, salad, cakes, and wine.\r\n\r\nJust as they were about to sit down and eat, there was a knocking\r\noutside. The woman said: \xe2\x80\x98Oh, heavens! It is my husband!\xe2\x80\x99 she quickly\r\nhid the roast meat inside the tiled stove, the wine under the pillow,\r\nthe salad on the bed, the cakes under it, and the parson in the closet\r\non the porch. Then she opened the door for her husband, and said: \xe2\x80\x98Thank\r\nheaven, you are back again! There is such a storm, it looks as if the\r\nworld were coming to an end.\xe2\x80\x99 The miller saw the peasant lying on the\r\nstraw, and asked, \xe2\x80\x98What is that fellow doing there?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Ah,\xe2\x80\x99 said the\r\nwife, \xe2\x80\x98the poor knave came in the storm and rain, and begged for\r\nshelter, so I gave him a bit of bread and cheese, and showed him where\r\nthe straw was.\xe2\x80\x99 The man said: \xe2\x80\x98I have no objection, but be quick and get\r\nme something to eat.\xe2\x80\x99 The woman said: \xe2\x80\x98But I have nothing but bread and\r\ncheese.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98I am contented with anything,\xe2\x80\x99 replied the husband, \xe2\x80\x98so far as\r\nI am concerned, bread and cheese will do,\xe2\x80\x99 and looked at the peasant and\r\nsaid: \xe2\x80\x98Come and eat some more with me.\xe2\x80\x99 The peasant did not require to\r\nbe invited twice, but got up and ate. After this the miller saw the skin\r\nin which the raven was, lying on the ground, and asked: \xe2\x80\x98What have you\r\nthere?\xe2\x80\x99 The peasant answered: \xe2\x80\x98I have a soothsayer inside it.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Can\r\nhe foretell anything to me?\xe2\x80\x99 said the miller. \xe2\x80\x98Why not?\xe2\x80\x99 answered\r\nthe peasant: \xe2\x80\x98but he only says four things, and the fifth he keeps to\r\nhimself.\xe2\x80\x99 The miller was curious, and said: \xe2\x80\x98Let him foretell something\r\nfor once.\xe2\x80\x99 Then the peasant pinched the raven\xe2\x80\x99s head, so that he croaked\r\nand made a noise like krr, krr. The miller said: \xe2\x80\x98What did he say?\xe2\x80\x99 The\r\npeasant answered: \xe2\x80\x98In the first place, he says that there is some wine\r\nhidden under the pillow.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Bless me!\xe2\x80\x99 cried the miller, and went there\r\nand found the wine. \xe2\x80\x98Now go on,\xe2\x80\x99 said he. The peasant made the raven\r\ncroak again, and said: \xe2\x80\x98In the second place, he says that there is some\r\nroast meat in the tiled stove.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Upon my word!\xe2\x80\x99 cried the miller, and\r\nwent thither, and found the roast meat. The peasant made the raven\r\nprophesy still more, and said: \xe2\x80\x98Thirdly, he says that there is some\r\nsalad on the bed.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98That would be a fine thing!\xe2\x80\x99 cried the miller, and\r\nwent there and found the salad. At last the peasant pinched the raven\r\nonce more till he croaked, and said: \xe2\x80\x98Fourthly, he says that there\r\nare some cakes under the bed.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98That would be a fine thing!\xe2\x80\x99 cried the\r\nmiller, and looked there, and found the cakes.\r\n\r\nAnd now the two sat down to the table together, but the miller\xe2\x80\x99s wife\r\nwas frightened to death, and went to bed and took all the keys with\r\nher. The miller would have liked much to know the fifth, but the little\r\npeasant said: \xe2\x80\x98First, we will quickly eat the four things, for the fifth\r\nis something bad.\xe2\x80\x99 So they ate, and after that they bargained how much\r\nthe miller was to give for the fifth prophecy, until they agreed on\r\nthree hundred talers. Then the peasant once more pinched the raven\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhead till he croaked loudly. The miller asked: \xe2\x80\x98What did he say?\xe2\x80\x99 The\r\npeasant replied: \xe2\x80\x98He says that the Devil is hiding outside there in\r\nthe closet on the porch.\xe2\x80\x99 The miller said: \xe2\x80\x98The Devil must go out,\xe2\x80\x99 and\r\nopened the house-door; then the woman was forced to give up the keys,\r\nand the peasant unlocked the closet. The parson ran out as fast as he\r\ncould, and the miller said: \xe2\x80\x98It was true; I saw the black rascal with my\r\nown eyes.\xe2\x80\x99 The peasant, however, made off next morning by daybreak with\r\nthe three hundred talers.\r\n\r\nAt home the small peasant gradually launched out; he built a beautiful\r\nhouse, and the peasants said: \xe2\x80\x98The small peasant has certainly been to\r\nthe place where golden snow falls, and people carry the gold home in\r\nshovels.\xe2\x80\x99 Then the small peasant was brought before the mayor, and\r\nbidden to say from whence his wealth came. He answered: \xe2\x80\x98I sold my cow\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nskin in the town, for three hundred talers.\xe2\x80\x99 When the peasants heard\r\nthat, they too wished to enjoy this great profit, and ran home, killed\r\nall their cows, and stripped off their skins in order to sell them in\r\nthe town to the greatest advantage. The mayor, however, said: \xe2\x80\x98But my\r\nservant must go first.\xe2\x80\x99 When she came to the merchant in the town, he\r\ndid not give her more than two talers for a skin, and when the others\r\ncame, he did not give them so much, and said: \xe2\x80\x98What can I do with all\r\nthese skins?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThen the peasants were vexed that the small peasant should have thus\r\noutwitted them, wanted to take vengeance on him, and accused him of this\r\ntreachery before the mayor. The innocent little peasant was unanimously\r\nsentenced to death, and was to be rolled into the water, in a barrel\r\npierced full of holes. He was led forth, and a priest was brought who\r\nwas to say a mass for his soul. The others were all obliged to retire to\r\na distance, and when the peasant looked at the priest, he recognized the\r\nman who had been with the miller\xe2\x80\x99s wife. He said to him: \xe2\x80\x98I set you free\r\nfrom the closet, set me free from the barrel.\xe2\x80\x99 At this same moment up\r\ncame, with a flock of sheep, the very shepherd whom the peasant knew had\r\nlong been wishing to be mayor, so he cried with all his might: \xe2\x80\x98No, I\r\nwill not do it; if the whole world insists on it, I will not do it!\xe2\x80\x99 The\r\nshepherd hearing that, came up to him, and asked: \xe2\x80\x98What are you about?\r\nWhat is it that you will not do?\xe2\x80\x99 The peasant said: \xe2\x80\x98They want to make\r\nme mayor, if I will but put myself in the barrel, but I will not do it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\nThe shepherd said: \xe2\x80\x98If nothing more than that is needful in order to be\r\nmayor, I would get into the barrel at once.\xe2\x80\x99 The peasant said: \xe2\x80\x98If you\r\nwill get in, you will be mayor.\xe2\x80\x99 The shepherd was willing, and got in,\r\nand the peasant shut the top down on him; then he took the shepherd\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nflock for himself, and drove it away. The parson went to the crowd,\r\nand declared that the mass had been said. Then they came and rolled the\r\nbarrel towards the water. When the barrel began to roll, the shepherd\r\ncried: \xe2\x80\x98I am quite willing to be mayor.\xe2\x80\x99 They believed no otherwise than\r\nthat it was the peasant who was saying this, and answered: \xe2\x80\x98That is\r\nwhat we intend, but first you shall look about you a little down below\r\nthere,\xe2\x80\x99 and they rolled the barrel down into the water.\r\n\r\nAfter that the peasants went home, and as they were entering the\r\nvillage, the small peasant also came quietly in, driving a flock of\r\nsheep and looking quite contented. Then the peasants were astonished,\r\nand said: \xe2\x80\x98Peasant, from whence do you come? Have you come out of the\r\nwater?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Yes, truly,\xe2\x80\x99 replied the peasant, \xe2\x80\x98I sank deep, deep down,\r\nuntil at last I got to the bottom; I pushed the bottom out of the\r\nbarrel, and crept out, and there were pretty meadows on which a number\r\nof lambs were feeding, and from thence I brought this flock away with\r\nme.\xe2\x80\x99 Said the peasants: \xe2\x80\x98Are there any more there?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Oh, yes,\xe2\x80\x99 said he,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98more than I could want.\xe2\x80\x99 Then the peasants made up their minds that\r\nthey too would fetch some sheep for themselves, a flock apiece, but the\r\nmayor said: \xe2\x80\x98I come first.\xe2\x80\x99 So they went to the water together, and just\r\nthen there were some of the small fleecy clouds in the blue sky, which\r\nare called little lambs, and they were reflected in the water, whereupon\r\nthe peasants cried: \xe2\x80\x98We already see the sheep down below!\xe2\x80\x99 The mayor\r\npressed forward and said: \xe2\x80\x98I will go down first, and look about me, and\r\nif things promise well I\xe2\x80\x99ll call you.\xe2\x80\x99 So he jumped in; splash! went\r\nthe water; it sounded as if he were calling them, and the whole crowd\r\nplunged in after him as one man. Then the entire village was dead, and\r\nthe small peasant, as sole heir, became a rich man.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFREDERICK AND CATHERINE\r\n\r\nThere was once a man called Frederick: he had a wife whose name was\r\nCatherine, and they had not long been married. One day Frederick said.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Kate! I am going to work in the fields; when I come back I shall be\r\nhungry so let me have something nice cooked, and a good draught of ale.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Very well,\xe2\x80\x99 said she, \xe2\x80\x98it shall all be ready.\xe2\x80\x99 When dinner-time drew\r\nnigh, Catherine took a nice steak, which was all the meat she had, and\r\nput it on the fire to fry. The steak soon began to look brown, and to\r\ncrackle in the pan; and Catherine stood by with a fork and turned it:\r\nthen she said to herself, \xe2\x80\x98The steak is almost ready, I may as well go\r\nto the cellar for the ale.\xe2\x80\x99 So she left the pan on the fire and took a\r\nlarge jug and went into the cellar and tapped the ale cask. The beer ran\r\ninto the jug and Catherine stood looking on. At last it popped into her\r\nhead, \xe2\x80\x98The dog is not shut up--he may be running away with the steak;\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s well thought of.\xe2\x80\x99 So up she ran from the cellar; and sure enough\r\nthe rascally cur had got the steak in his mouth, and was making off with\r\nit.\r\n\r\nAway ran Catherine, and away ran the dog across the field: but he ran\r\nfaster than she, and stuck close to the steak. \xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s all gone, and \xe2\x80\x9cwhat\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t be cured must be endured\xe2\x80\x9d,\xe2\x80\x99 said Catherine. So she turned round;\r\nand as she had run a good way and was tired, she walked home leisurely\r\nto cool herself.\r\n\r\nNow all this time the ale was running too, for Catherine had not turned\r\nthe cock; and when the jug was full the liquor ran upon the floor till\r\nthe cask was empty. When she got to the cellar stairs she saw what had\r\nhappened. \xe2\x80\x98My stars!\xe2\x80\x99 said she, \xe2\x80\x98what shall I do to keep Frederick from\r\nseeing all this slopping about?\xe2\x80\x99 So she thought a while; and at last\r\nremembered that there was a sack of fine meal bought at the last fair,\r\nand that if she sprinkled this over the floor it would suck up the ale\r\nnicely. \xe2\x80\x98What a lucky thing,\xe2\x80\x99 said she, \xe2\x80\x98that we kept that meal! we have\r\nnow a good use for it.\xe2\x80\x99 So away she went for it: but she managed to set\r\nit down just upon the great jug full of beer, and upset it; and thus\r\nall the ale that had been saved was set swimming on the floor also. \xe2\x80\x98Ah!\r\nwell,\xe2\x80\x99 said she, \xe2\x80\x98when one goes another may as well follow.\xe2\x80\x99 Then she\r\nstrewed the meal all about the cellar, and was quite pleased with her\r\ncleverness, and said, \xe2\x80\x98How very neat and clean it looks!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAt noon Frederick came home. \xe2\x80\x98Now, wife,\xe2\x80\x99 cried he, \xe2\x80\x98what have you for\r\ndinner?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98O Frederick!\xe2\x80\x99 answered she, \xe2\x80\x98I was cooking you a steak; but\r\nwhile I went down to draw the ale, the dog ran away with it; and while\r\nI ran after him, the ale ran out; and when I went to dry up the ale\r\nwith the sack of meal that we got at the fair, I upset the jug: but the\r\ncellar is now quite dry, and looks so clean!\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Kate, Kate,\xe2\x80\x99 said he,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98how could you do all this?\xe2\x80\x99 Why did you leave the steak to fry, and the\r\nale to run, and then spoil all the meal?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Why, Frederick,\xe2\x80\x99 said she, \xe2\x80\x98I\r\ndid not know I was doing wrong; you should have told me before.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe husband thought to himself, \xe2\x80\x98If my wife manages matters thus, I must\r\nlook sharp myself.\xe2\x80\x99 Now he had a good deal of gold in the house: so he\r\nsaid to Catherine, \xe2\x80\x98What pretty yellow buttons these are! I shall put\r\nthem into a box and bury them in the garden; but take care that you\r\nnever go near or meddle with them.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98No, Frederick,\xe2\x80\x99 said she, \xe2\x80\x98that\r\nI never will.\xe2\x80\x99 As soon as he was gone, there came by some pedlars with\r\nearthenware plates and dishes, and they asked her whether she would buy.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh dear me, I should like to buy very much, but I have no money: if\r\nyou had any use for yellow buttons, I might deal with you.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Yellow\r\nbuttons!\xe2\x80\x99 said they: \xe2\x80\x98let us have a look at them.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Go into the garden\r\nand dig where I tell you, and you will find the yellow buttons: I dare\r\nnot go myself.\xe2\x80\x99 So the rogues went: and when they found what these\r\nyellow buttons were, they took them all away, and left her plenty of\r\nplates and dishes. Then she set them all about the house for a show:\r\nand when Frederick came back, he cried out, \xe2\x80\x98Kate, what have you been\r\ndoing?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98See,\xe2\x80\x99 said she, \xe2\x80\x98I have bought all these with your yellow\r\nbuttons: but I did not touch them myself; the pedlars went themselves\r\nand dug them up.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Wife, wife,\xe2\x80\x99 said Frederick, \xe2\x80\x98what a pretty piece of\r\nwork you have made! those yellow buttons were all my money: how came you\r\nto do such a thing?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Why,\xe2\x80\x99 answered she, \xe2\x80\x98I did not know there was any\r\nharm in it; you should have told me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nCatherine stood musing for a while, and at last said to her husband,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hark ye, Frederick, we will soon get the gold back: let us run after\r\nthe thieves.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Well, we will try,\xe2\x80\x99 answered he; \xe2\x80\x98but take some butter\r\nand cheese with you, that we may have something to eat by the way.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Very well,\xe2\x80\x99 said she; and they set out: and as Frederick walked the\r\nfastest, he left his wife some way behind. \xe2\x80\x98It does not matter,\xe2\x80\x99 thought\r\nshe: \xe2\x80\x98when we turn back, I shall be so much nearer home than he.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nPresently she came to the top of a hill, down the side of which there\r\nwas a road so narrow that the cart wheels always chafed the trees\r\non each side as they passed. \xe2\x80\x98Ah, see now,\xe2\x80\x99 said she, \xe2\x80\x98how they have\r\nbruised and wounded those poor trees; they will never get well.\xe2\x80\x99 So she\r\ntook pity on them, and made use of the butter to grease them all, so\r\nthat the wheels might not hurt them so much. While she was doing this\r\nkind office one of her cheeses fell out of the basket, and rolled down\r\nthe hill. Catherine looked, but could not see where it had gone; so she\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x98Well, I suppose the other will go the same way and find you; he\r\nhas younger legs than I have.\xe2\x80\x99 Then she rolled the other cheese after\r\nit; and away it went, nobody knows where, down the hill. But she said\r\nshe supposed that they knew the road, and would follow her, and she\r\ncould not stay there all day waiting for them.\r\n\r\nAt last she overtook Frederick, who desired her to give him something to\r\neat. Then she gave him the dry bread. \xe2\x80\x98Where are the butter and cheese?\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsaid he. \xe2\x80\x98Oh!\xe2\x80\x99 answered she, \xe2\x80\x98I used the butter to grease those poor\r\ntrees that the wheels chafed so: and one of the cheeses ran away so I\r\nsent the other after it to find it, and I suppose they are both on\r\nthe road together somewhere.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98What a goose you are to do such silly\r\nthings!\xe2\x80\x99 said the husband. \xe2\x80\x98How can you say so?\xe2\x80\x99 said she; \xe2\x80\x98I am sure\r\nyou never told me not.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThey ate the dry bread together; and Frederick said, \xe2\x80\x98Kate, I hope you\r\nlocked the door safe when you came away.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98No,\xe2\x80\x99 answered she, \xe2\x80\x98you did\r\nnot tell me.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Then go home, and do it now before we go any farther,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsaid Frederick, \xe2\x80\x98and bring with you something to eat.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nCatherine did as he told her, and thought to herself by the way,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Frederick wants something to eat; but I don\xe2\x80\x99t think he is very fond of\r\nbutter and cheese: I\xe2\x80\x99ll bring him a bag of fine nuts, and the vinegar,\r\nfor I have often seen him take some.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWhen she reached home, she bolted the back door, but the front door she\r\ntook off the hinges, and said, \xe2\x80\x98Frederick told me to lock the door, but\r\nsurely it can nowhere be so safe if I take it with me.\xe2\x80\x99 So she took\r\nher time by the way; and when she overtook her husband she cried\r\nout, \xe2\x80\x98There, Frederick, there is the door itself, you may watch it as\r\ncarefully as you please.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Alas! alas!\xe2\x80\x99 said he, \xe2\x80\x98what a clever wife I\r\nhave! I sent you to make the house fast, and you take the door away, so\r\nthat everybody may go in and out as they please--however, as you have\r\nbrought the door, you shall carry it about with you for your pains.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Very well,\xe2\x80\x99 answered she, \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll carry the door; but I\xe2\x80\x99ll not carry the\r\nnuts and vinegar bottle also--that would be too much of a load; so if\r\nyou please, I\xe2\x80\x99ll fasten them to the door.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nFrederick of course made no objection to that plan, and they set off\r\ninto the wood to look for the thieves; but they could not find them: and\r\nwhen it grew dark, they climbed up into a tree to spend the night there.\r\nScarcely were they up, than who should come by but the very rogues they\r\nwere looking for. They were in truth great rascals, and belonged to that\r\nclass of people who find things before they are lost; they were tired;\r\nso they sat down and made a fire under the very tree where Frederick and\r\nCatherine were. Frederick slipped down on the other side, and picked up\r\nsome stones. Then he climbed up again, and tried to hit the thieves on\r\nthe head with them: but they only said, \xe2\x80\x98It must be near morning, for\r\nthe wind shakes the fir-apples down.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nCatherine, who had the door on her shoulder, began to be very tired;\r\nbut she thought it was the nuts upon it that were so heavy: so she said\r\nsoftly, \xe2\x80\x98Frederick, I must let the nuts go.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98No,\xe2\x80\x99 answered he, \xe2\x80\x98not\r\nnow, they will discover us.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98I can\xe2\x80\x99t help that: they must go.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Well,\r\nthen, make haste and throw them down, if you will.\xe2\x80\x99 Then away rattled\r\nthe nuts down among the boughs and one of the thieves cried, \xe2\x80\x98Bless me,\r\nit is hailing.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nA little while after, Catherine thought the door was still very heavy:\r\nso she whispered to Frederick, \xe2\x80\x98I must throw the vinegar down.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Pray\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x99 answered he, \xe2\x80\x98it will discover us.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98I can\xe2\x80\x99t help that,\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nshe, \xe2\x80\x98go it must.\xe2\x80\x99 So she poured all the vinegar down; and the thieves\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x98What a heavy dew there is!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAt last it popped into Catherine\xe2\x80\x99s head that it was the door itself that\r\nwas so heavy all the time: so she whispered, \xe2\x80\x98Frederick, I must throw\r\nthe door down soon.\xe2\x80\x99 But he begged and prayed her not to do so, for he\r\nwas sure it would betray them. \xe2\x80\x98Here goes, however,\xe2\x80\x99 said she: and down\r\nwent the door with such a clatter upon the thieves, that they cried\r\nout \xe2\x80\x98Murder!\xe2\x80\x99 and not knowing what was coming, ran away as fast as they\r\ncould, and left all the gold. So when Frederick and Catherine came down,\r\nthere they found all their money safe and sound.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSWEETHEART ROLAND\r\n\r\nThere was once upon a time a woman who was a real witch and had two\r\ndaughters, one ugly and wicked, and this one she loved because she was\r\nher own daughter, and one beautiful and good, and this one she hated,\r\nbecause she was her stepdaughter. The stepdaughter once had a pretty\r\napron, which the other fancied so much that she became envious, and\r\ntold her mother that she must and would have that apron. \xe2\x80\x98Be quiet, my\r\nchild,\xe2\x80\x99 said the old woman, \xe2\x80\x98and you shall have it. Your stepsister has\r\nlong deserved death; tonight when she is asleep I will come and cut her\r\nhead off. Only be careful that you are at the far side of the bed, and\r\npush her well to the front.\xe2\x80\x99 It would have been all over with the poor\r\ngirl if she had not just then been standing in a corner, and heard\r\neverything. All day long she dared not go out of doors, and when bedtime\r\nhad come, the witch\xe2\x80\x99s daughter got into bed first, so as to lie at the\r\nfar side, but when she was asleep, the other pushed her gently to the\r\nfront, and took for herself the place at the back, close by the wall. In\r\nthe night, the old woman came creeping in, she held an axe in her right\r\nhand, and felt with her left to see if anyone were lying at the outside,\r\nand then she grasped the axe with both hands, and cut her own child\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhead off.\r\n\r\nWhen she had gone away, the girl got up and went to her sweetheart, who\r\nwas called Roland, and knocked at his door. When he came out, she said\r\nto him: \xe2\x80\x98Listen, dearest Roland, we must fly in all haste; my stepmother\r\nwanted to kill me, but has struck her own child. When daylight comes,\r\nand she sees what she has done, we shall be lost.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98But,\xe2\x80\x99 said Roland,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I counsel you first to take away her magic wand, or we cannot escape\r\nif she pursues us.\xe2\x80\x99 The maiden fetched the magic wand, and she took the\r\ndead girl\xe2\x80\x99s head and dropped three drops of blood on the ground, one in\r\nfront of the bed, one in the kitchen, and one on the stairs. Then she\r\nhurried away with her lover.\r\n\r\nWhen the old witch got up next morning, she called her daughter, and\r\nwanted to give her the apron, but she did not come. Then the witch\r\ncried: \xe2\x80\x98Where are you?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Here, on the stairs, I am sweeping,\xe2\x80\x99 answered\r\nthe first drop of blood. The old woman went out, but saw no one on the\r\nstairs, and cried again: \xe2\x80\x98Where are you?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Here in the kitchen, I am\r\nwarming myself,\xe2\x80\x99 cried the second drop of blood. She went into the\r\nkitchen, but found no one. Then she cried again: \xe2\x80\x98Where are you?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Ah,\r\nhere in the bed, I am sleeping,\xe2\x80\x99 cried the third drop of blood. She went\r\ninto the room to the bed. What did she see there? Her own child,\r\nwhose head she had cut off, bathed in her blood. The witch fell into\r\na passion, sprang to the window, and as she could look forth quite far\r\ninto the world, she perceived her stepdaughter hurrying away with her\r\nsweetheart Roland. \xe2\x80\x98That shall not help you,\xe2\x80\x99 cried she, \xe2\x80\x98even if you\r\nhave got a long way off, you shall still not escape me.\xe2\x80\x99 She put on her\r\nmany-league boots, in which she covered an hour\xe2\x80\x99s walk at every step,\r\nand it was not long before she overtook them. The girl, however, when\r\nshe saw the old woman striding towards her, changed, with her magic\r\nwand, her sweetheart Roland into a lake, and herself into a duck\r\nswimming in the middle of it. The witch placed herself on the shore,\r\nthrew breadcrumbs in, and went to endless trouble to entice the duck;\r\nbut the duck did not let herself be enticed, and the old woman had to\r\ngo home at night as she had come. At this the girl and her sweetheart\r\nRoland resumed their natural shapes again, and they walked on the whole\r\nnight until daybreak. Then the maiden changed herself into a beautiful\r\nflower which stood in the midst of a briar hedge, and her sweetheart\r\nRoland into a fiddler. It was not long before the witch came striding up\r\ntowards them, and said to the musician: \xe2\x80\x98Dear musician, may I pluck that\r\nbeautiful flower for myself?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Oh, yes,\xe2\x80\x99 he replied, \xe2\x80\x98I will play to\r\nyou while you do it.\xe2\x80\x99 As she was hastily creeping into the hedge and was\r\njust going to pluck the flower, knowing perfectly well who the flower\r\nwas, he began to play, and whether she would or not, she was forced\r\nto dance, for it was a magical dance. The faster he played, the more\r\nviolent springs was she forced to make, and the thorns tore her clothes\r\nfrom her body, and pricked her and wounded her till she bled, and as he\r\ndid not stop, she had to dance till she lay dead on the ground.\r\n\r\nAs they were now set free, Roland said: \xe2\x80\x98Now I will go to my father and\r\narrange for the wedding.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Then in the meantime I will stay here and\r\nwait for you,\xe2\x80\x99 said the girl, \xe2\x80\x98and that no one may recognize me, I will\r\nchange myself into a red stone landmark.\xe2\x80\x99 Then Roland went away, and the\r\ngirl stood like a red landmark in the field and waited for her beloved.\r\nBut when Roland got home, he fell into the snares of another, who so\r\nfascinated him that he forgot the maiden. The poor girl remained there a\r\nlong time, but at length, as he did not return at all, she was sad, and\r\nchanged herself into a flower, and thought: \xe2\x80\x98Someone will surely come\r\nthis way, and trample me down.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nIt befell, however, that a shepherd kept his sheep in the field and saw\r\nthe flower, and as it was so pretty, plucked it, took it with him, and\r\nlaid it away in his chest. From that time forth, strange things happened\r\nin the shepherd\xe2\x80\x99s house. When he arose in the morning, all the work was\r\nalready done, the room was swept, the table and benches cleaned, the\r\nfire in the hearth was lighted, and the water was fetched, and at noon,\r\nwhen he came home, the table was laid, and a good dinner served. He\r\ncould not conceive how this came to pass, for he never saw a human being\r\nin his house, and no one could have concealed himself in it. He was\r\ncertainly pleased with this good attendance, but still at last he was so\r\nafraid that he went to a wise woman and asked for her advice. The wise\r\nwoman said: \xe2\x80\x98There is some enchantment behind it, listen very early some\r\nmorning if anything is moving in the room, and if you see anything, no\r\nmatter what it is, throw a white cloth over it, and then the magic will\r\nbe stopped.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe shepherd did as she bade him, and next morning just as day dawned,\r\nhe saw the chest open, and the flower come out. Swiftly he\r\nsprang towards it, and threw a white cloth over it. Instantly the\r\ntransformation came to an end, and a beautiful girl stood before him,\r\nwho admitted to him that she had been the flower, and that up to this\r\ntime she had attended to his house-keeping. She told him her story,\r\nand as she pleased him he asked her if she would marry him, but she\r\nanswered: \xe2\x80\x98No,\xe2\x80\x99 for she wanted to remain faithful to her sweetheart\r\nRoland, although he had deserted her. Nevertheless, she promised not to\r\ngo away, but to continue keeping house for the shepherd.\r\n\r\nAnd now the time drew near when Roland\xe2\x80\x99s wedding was to be celebrated,\r\nand then, according to an old custom in the country, it was announced\r\nthat all the girls were to be present at it, and sing in honour of the\r\nbridal pair. When the faithful maiden heard of this, she grew so sad\r\nthat she thought her heart would break, and she would not go thither,\r\nbut the other girls came and took her. When it came to her turn to sing,\r\nshe stepped back, until at last she was the only one left, and then she\r\ncould not refuse. But when she began her song, and it reached Roland\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nears, he sprang up and cried: \xe2\x80\x98I know the voice, that is the true\r\nbride, I will have no other!\xe2\x80\x99 Everything he had forgotten, and which had\r\nvanished from his mind, had suddenly come home again to his heart. Then\r\nthe faithful maiden held her wedding with her sweetheart Roland, and\r\ngrief came to an end and joy began.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSNOWDROP\r\n\r\nIt was the middle of winter, when the broad flakes of snow were falling\r\naround, that the queen of a country many thousand miles off sat working\r\nat her window. The frame of the window was made of fine black ebony, and\r\nas she sat looking out upon the snow, she pricked her finger, and three\r\ndrops of blood fell upon it. Then she gazed thoughtfully upon the red\r\ndrops that sprinkled the white snow, and said, \xe2\x80\x98Would that my little\r\ndaughter may be as white as that snow, as red as that blood, and as\r\nblack as this ebony windowframe!\xe2\x80\x99 And so the little girl really did grow\r\nup; her skin was as white as snow, her cheeks as rosy as the blood, and\r\nher hair as black as ebony; and she was called Snowdrop.\r\n\r\nBut this queen died; and the king soon married another wife, who became\r\nqueen, and was very beautiful, but so vain that she could not bear\r\nto think that anyone could be handsomer than she was. She had a fairy\r\nlooking-glass, to which she used to go, and then she would gaze upon\r\nherself in it, and say:\r\n\r\n \xe2\x80\x98Tell me, glass, tell me true!\r\n  Of all the ladies in the land,\r\n  Who is fairest, tell me, who?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAnd the glass had always answered:\r\n\r\n \xe2\x80\x98Thou, queen, art the fairest in all the land.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBut Snowdrop grew more and more beautiful; and when she was seven years\r\nold she was as bright as the day, and fairer than the queen herself.\r\nThen the glass one day answered the queen, when she went to look in it\r\nas usual:\r\n\r\n \xe2\x80\x98Thou, queen, art fair, and beauteous to see,\r\n  But Snowdrop is lovelier far than thee!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWhen she heard this she turned pale with rage and envy, and called to\r\none of her servants, and said, \xe2\x80\x98Take Snowdrop away into the wide wood,\r\nthat I may never see her any more.\xe2\x80\x99 Then the servant led her away; but\r\nhis heart melted when Snowdrop begged him to spare her life, and he\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x98I will not hurt you, thou pretty child.\xe2\x80\x99 So he left her by\r\nherself; and though he thought it most likely that the wild beasts would\r\ntear her in pieces, he felt as if a great weight were taken off his\r\nheart when he had made up his mind not to kill her but to leave her to\r\nher fate, with the chance of someone finding and saving her.\r\n\r\nThen poor Snowdrop wandered along through the wood in great fear; and\r\nthe wild beasts roared about her, but none did her any harm. In the\r\nevening she came to a cottage among the hills, and went in to rest, for\r\nher little feet would carry her no further. Everything was spruce and\r\nneat in the cottage: on the table was spread a white cloth, and there\r\nwere seven little plates, seven little loaves, and seven little glasses\r\nwith wine in them; and seven knives and forks laid in order; and by\r\nthe wall stood seven little beds. As she was very hungry, she picked\r\na little piece of each loaf and drank a very little wine out of each\r\nglass; and after that she thought she would lie down and rest. So she\r\ntried all the little beds; but one was too long, and another was too\r\nshort, till at last the seventh suited her: and there she laid herself\r\ndown and went to sleep.\r\n\r\nBy and by in came the masters of the cottage. Now they were seven little\r\ndwarfs, that lived among the mountains, and dug and searched for gold.\r\nThey lighted up their seven lamps, and saw at once that all was not\r\nright. The first said, \xe2\x80\x98Who has been sitting on my stool?\xe2\x80\x99 The second,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Who has been eating off my plate?\xe2\x80\x99 The third, \xe2\x80\x98Who has been picking my\r\nbread?\xe2\x80\x99 The fourth, \xe2\x80\x98Who has been meddling with my spoon?\xe2\x80\x99 The fifth,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Who has been handling my fork?\xe2\x80\x99 The sixth, \xe2\x80\x98Who has been cutting with\r\nmy knife?\xe2\x80\x99 The seventh, \xe2\x80\x98Who has been drinking my wine?\xe2\x80\x99 Then the first\r\nlooked round and said, \xe2\x80\x98Who has been lying on my bed?\xe2\x80\x99 And the rest came\r\nrunning to him, and everyone cried out that somebody had been upon his\r\nbed. But the seventh saw Snowdrop, and called all his brethren to come\r\nand see her; and they cried out with wonder and astonishment and brought\r\ntheir lamps to look at her, and said, \xe2\x80\x98Good heavens! what a lovely child\r\nshe is!\xe2\x80\x99 And they were very glad to see her, and took care not to wake\r\nher; and the seventh dwarf slept an hour with each of the other dwarfs\r\nin turn, till the night was gone.\r\n\r\nIn the morning Snowdrop told them all her story; and they pitied her,\r\nand said if she would keep all things in order, and cook and wash and\r\nknit and spin for them, she might stay where she was, and they would\r\ntake good care of her. Then they went out all day long to their work,\r\nseeking for gold and silver in the mountains: but Snowdrop was left at\r\nhome; and they warned her, and said, \xe2\x80\x98The queen will soon find out where\r\nyou are, so take care and let no one in.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBut the queen, now that she thought Snowdrop was dead, believed that she\r\nmust be the handsomest lady in the land; and she went to her glass and\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n \xe2\x80\x98Tell me, glass, tell me true!\r\n  Of all the ladies in the land,\r\n  Who is fairest, tell me, who?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAnd the glass answered:\r\n\r\n \xe2\x80\x98Thou, queen, art the fairest in all this land:\r\n  But over the hills, in the greenwood shade,\r\n  Where the seven dwarfs their dwelling have made,\r\n  There Snowdrop is hiding her head; and she\r\n  Is lovelier far, O queen! than thee.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThen the queen was very much frightened; for she knew that the glass\r\nalways spoke the truth, and was sure that the servant had betrayed her.\r\nAnd she could not bear to think that anyone lived who was more beautiful\r\nthan she was; so she dressed herself up as an old pedlar, and went\r\nher way over the hills, to the place where the dwarfs dwelt. Then she\r\nknocked at the door, and cried, \xe2\x80\x98Fine wares to sell!\xe2\x80\x99 Snowdrop looked\r\nout at the window, and said, \xe2\x80\x98Good day, good woman! what have you to\r\nsell?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Good wares, fine wares,\xe2\x80\x99 said she; \xe2\x80\x98laces and bobbins of all\r\ncolours.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98I will let the old lady in; she seems to be a very good\r\nsort of body,\xe2\x80\x99 thought Snowdrop, as she ran down and unbolted the door.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Bless me!\xe2\x80\x99 said the old woman, \xe2\x80\x98how badly your stays are laced! Let me\r\nlace them up with one of my nice new laces.\xe2\x80\x99 Snowdrop did not dream of\r\nany mischief; so she stood before the old woman; but she set to work\r\nso nimbly, and pulled the lace so tight, that Snowdrop\xe2\x80\x99s breath was\r\nstopped, and she fell down as if she were dead. \xe2\x80\x98There\xe2\x80\x99s an end to all\r\nthy beauty,\xe2\x80\x99 said the spiteful queen, and went away home.\r\n\r\nIn the evening the seven dwarfs came home; and I need not say how\r\ngrieved they were to see their faithful Snowdrop stretched out upon the\r\nground, as if she was quite dead. However, they lifted her up, and when\r\nthey found what ailed her, they cut the lace; and in a little time she\r\nbegan to breathe, and very soon came to life again. Then they said, \xe2\x80\x98The\r\nold woman was the queen herself; take care another time, and let no one\r\nin when we are away.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWhen the queen got home, she went straight to her glass, and spoke to it\r\nas before; but to her great grief it still said:\r\n\r\n \xe2\x80\x98Thou, queen, art the fairest in all this land:\r\n  But over the hills, in the greenwood shade,\r\n  Where the seven dwarfs their dwelling have made,\r\n  There Snowdrop is hiding her head; and she\r\n  Is lovelier far, O queen! than thee.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThen the blood ran cold in her heart with spite and malice, to see that\r\nSnowdrop still lived; and she dressed herself up again, but in quite\r\nanother dress from the one she wore before, and took with her a poisoned\r\ncomb. When she reached the dwarfs\xe2\x80\x99 cottage, she knocked at the door, and\r\ncried, \xe2\x80\x98Fine wares to sell!\xe2\x80\x99 But Snowdrop said, \xe2\x80\x98I dare not let anyone\r\nin.\xe2\x80\x99 Then the queen said, \xe2\x80\x98Only look at my beautiful combs!\xe2\x80\x99 and gave\r\nher the poisoned one. And it looked so pretty, that she took it up and\r\nput it into her hair to try it; but the moment it touched her head,\r\nthe poison was so powerful that she fell down senseless. \xe2\x80\x98There you may\r\nlie,\xe2\x80\x99 said the queen, and went her way. But by good luck the dwarfs\r\ncame in very early that evening; and when they saw Snowdrop lying on\r\nthe ground, they thought what had happened, and soon found the poisoned\r\ncomb. And when they took it away she got well, and told them all that\r\nhad passed; and they warned her once more not to open the door to\r\nanyone.\r\n\r\nMeantime the queen went home to her glass, and shook with rage when she\r\nread the very same answer as before; and she said, \xe2\x80\x98Snowdrop shall die,\r\nif it cost me my life.\xe2\x80\x99 So she went by herself into her chamber, and got\r\nready a poisoned apple: the outside looked very rosy and tempting, but\r\nwhoever tasted it was sure to die. Then she dressed herself up as a\r\npeasant\xe2\x80\x99s wife, and travelled over the hills to the dwarfs\xe2\x80\x99 cottage,\r\nand knocked at the door; but Snowdrop put her head out of the window and\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x98I dare not let anyone in, for the dwarfs have told me not.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Do\r\nas you please,\xe2\x80\x99 said the old woman, \xe2\x80\x98but at any rate take this pretty\r\napple; I will give it you.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98No,\xe2\x80\x99 said Snowdrop, \xe2\x80\x98I dare not take it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You silly girl!\xe2\x80\x99 answered the other, \xe2\x80\x98what are you afraid of? Do you\r\nthink it is poisoned? Come! do you eat one part, and I will eat the\r\nother.\xe2\x80\x99 Now the apple was so made up that one side was good, though the\r\nother side was poisoned. Then Snowdrop was much tempted to taste, for\r\nthe apple looked so very nice; and when she saw the old woman eat, she\r\ncould wait no longer. But she had scarcely put the piece into her mouth,\r\nwhen she fell down dead upon the ground. \xe2\x80\x98This time nothing will save\r\nthee,\xe2\x80\x99 said the queen; and she went home to her glass, and at last it\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n \xe2\x80\x98Thou, queen, art the fairest of all the fair.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAnd then her wicked heart was glad, and as happy as such a heart could\r\nbe.\r\n\r\nWhen evening came, and the dwarfs had gone home, they found Snowdrop\r\nlying on the ground: no breath came from her lips, and they were afraid\r\nthat she was quite dead. They lifted her up, and combed her hair, and\r\nwashed her face with wine and water; but all was in vain, for the little\r\ngirl seemed quite dead. So they laid her down upon a bier, and all seven\r\nwatched and bewailed her three whole days; and then they thought they\r\nwould bury her: but her cheeks were still rosy; and her face looked just\r\nas it did while she was alive; so they said, \xe2\x80\x98We will never bury her in\r\nthe cold ground.\xe2\x80\x99 And they made a coffin of glass, so that they might\r\nstill look at her, and wrote upon it in golden letters what her name\r\nwas, and that she was a king\xe2\x80\x99s daughter. And the coffin was set among\r\nthe hills, and one of the dwarfs always sat by it and watched. And the\r\nbirds of the air came too, and bemoaned Snowdrop; and first of all came\r\nan owl, and then a raven, and at last a dove, and sat by her side.\r\n\r\nAnd thus Snowdrop lay for a long, long time, and still only looked as\r\nthough she was asleep; for she was even now as white as snow, and as red\r\nas blood, and as black as ebony. At last a prince came and called at the\r\ndwarfs\xe2\x80\x99 house; and he saw Snowdrop, and read what was written in golden\r\nletters. Then he offered the dwarfs money, and prayed and besought them\r\nto let him take her away; but they said, \xe2\x80\x98We will not part with her for\r\nall the gold in the world.\xe2\x80\x99 At last, however, they had pity on him, and\r\ngave him the coffin; but the moment he lifted it up to carry it home\r\nwith him, the piece of apple fell from between her lips, and Snowdrop\r\nawoke, and said, \xe2\x80\x98Where am I?\xe2\x80\x99 And the prince said, \xe2\x80\x98Thou art quite safe\r\nwith me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThen he told her all that had happened, and said, \xe2\x80\x98I love you far better\r\nthan all the world; so come with me to my father\xe2\x80\x99s palace, and you shall\r\nbe my wife.\xe2\x80\x99 And Snowdrop consented, and went home with the prince;\r\nand everything was got ready with great pomp and splendour for their\r\nwedding.\r\n\r\nTo the feast was asked, among the rest, Snowdrop\xe2\x80\x99s old enemy the queen;\r\nand as she was dressing herself in fine rich clothes, she looked in the\r\nglass and said:\r\n\r\n \xe2\x80\x98Tell me, glass, tell me true!\r\n  Of all the ladies in the land,\r\n  Who is fairest, tell me, who?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAnd the glass answered:\r\n\r\n \xe2\x80\x98Thou, lady, art loveliest here, I ween;\r\n  But lovelier far is the new-made queen.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWhen she heard this she started with rage; but her envy and curiosity\r\nwere so great, that she could not help setting out to see the bride. And\r\nwhen she got there, and saw that it was no other than Snowdrop, who, as\r\nshe thought, had been dead a long while, she choked with rage, and fell\r\ndown and died: but Snowdrop and the prince lived and reigned happily\r\nover that land many, many years; and sometimes they went up into the\r\nmountains, and paid a visit to the little dwarfs, who had been so kind\r\nto Snowdrop in her time of need.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PINK\r\n\r\nThere was once upon a time a queen to whom God had given no children.\r\nEvery morning she went into the garden and prayed to God in heaven to\r\nbestow on her a son or a daughter. Then an angel from heaven came to her\r\nand said: \xe2\x80\x98Be at rest, you shall have a son with the power of wishing,\r\nso that whatsoever in the world he wishes for, that shall he have.\xe2\x80\x99 Then\r\nshe went to the king, and told him the joyful tidings, and when the time\r\nwas come she gave birth to a son, and the king was filled with gladness.\r\n\r\nEvery morning she went with the child to the garden where the wild\r\nbeasts were kept, and washed herself there in a clear stream. It\r\nhappened once when the child was a little older, that it was lying in\r\nher arms and she fell asleep. Then came the old cook, who knew that the\r\nchild had the power of wishing, and stole it away, and he took a hen,\r\nand cut it in pieces, and dropped some of its blood on the queen\xe2\x80\x99s apron\r\nand on her dress. Then he carried the child away to a secret place,\r\nwhere a nurse was obliged to suckle it, and he ran to the king and\r\naccused the queen of having allowed her child to be taken from her by\r\nthe wild beasts. When the king saw the blood on her apron, he believed\r\nthis, fell into such a passion that he ordered a high tower to be built,\r\nin which neither sun nor moon could be seen and had his wife put into\r\nit, and walled up. Here she was to stay for seven years without meat\r\nor drink, and die of hunger. But God sent two angels from heaven in the\r\nshape of white doves, which flew to her twice a day, and carried her\r\nfood until the seven years were over.\r\n\r\nThe cook, however, thought to himself: \xe2\x80\x98If the child has the power of\r\nwishing, and I am here, he might very easily get me into trouble.\xe2\x80\x99 So\r\nhe left the palace and went to the boy, who was already big enough to\r\nspeak, and said to him: \xe2\x80\x98Wish for a beautiful palace for yourself with\r\na garden, and all else that pertains to it.\xe2\x80\x99 Scarcely were the words out\r\nof the boy\xe2\x80\x99s mouth, when everything was there that he had wished for.\r\nAfter a while the cook said to him: \xe2\x80\x98It is not well for you to be so\r\nalone, wish for a pretty girl as a companion.\xe2\x80\x99 Then the king\xe2\x80\x99s son\r\nwished for one, and she immediately stood before him, and was more\r\nbeautiful than any painter could have painted her. The two played\r\ntogether, and loved each other with all their hearts, and the old cook\r\nwent out hunting like a nobleman. The thought occurred to him, however,\r\nthat the king\xe2\x80\x99s son might some day wish to be with his father, and thus\r\nbring him into great peril. So he went out and took the maiden aside,\r\nand said: \xe2\x80\x98Tonight when the boy is asleep, go to his bed and plunge this\r\nknife into his heart, and bring me his heart and tongue, and if you do\r\nnot do it, you shall lose your life.\xe2\x80\x99 Thereupon he went away, and when\r\nhe returned next day she had not done it, and said: \xe2\x80\x98Why should I shed\r\nthe blood of an innocent boy who has never harmed anyone?\xe2\x80\x99 The cook once\r\nmore said: \xe2\x80\x98If you do not do it, it shall cost you your own life.\xe2\x80\x99 When\r\nhe had gone away, she had a little hind brought to her, and ordered her\r\nto be killed, and took her heart and tongue, and laid them on a plate,\r\nand when she saw the old man coming, she said to the boy: \xe2\x80\x98Lie down in\r\nyour bed, and draw the clothes over you.\xe2\x80\x99 Then the wicked wretch came in\r\nand said: \xe2\x80\x98Where are the boy\xe2\x80\x99s heart and tongue?\xe2\x80\x99 The girl reached the\r\nplate to him, but the king\xe2\x80\x99s son threw off the quilt, and said: \xe2\x80\x98You old\r\nsinner, why did you want to kill me? Now will I pronounce thy sentence.\r\nYou shall become a black poodle and have a gold collar round your neck,\r\nand shall eat burning coals, till the flames burst forth from your\r\nthroat.\xe2\x80\x99 And when he had spoken these words, the old man was changed\r\ninto a poodle dog, and had a gold collar round his neck, and the cooks\r\nwere ordered to bring up some live coals, and these he ate, until the\r\nflames broke forth from his throat. The king\xe2\x80\x99s son remained there a\r\nshort while longer, and he thought of his mother, and wondered if she\r\nwere still alive. At length he said to the maiden: \xe2\x80\x98I will go home to my\r\nown country; if you will go with me, I will provide for you.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Ah,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nshe replied, \xe2\x80\x98the way is so long, and what shall I do in a strange land\r\nwhere I am unknown?\xe2\x80\x99 As she did not seem quite willing, and as they\r\ncould not be parted from each other, he wished that she might be changed\r\ninto a beautiful pink, and took her with him. Then he went away to his\r\nown country, and the poodle had to run after him. He went to the tower\r\nin which his mother was confined, and as it was so high, he wished for\r\na ladder which would reach up to the very top. Then he mounted up and\r\nlooked inside, and cried: \xe2\x80\x98Beloved mother, Lady Queen, are you still\r\nalive, or are you dead?\xe2\x80\x99 She answered: \xe2\x80\x98I have just eaten, and am still\r\nsatisfied,\xe2\x80\x99 for she thought the angels were there. Said he: \xe2\x80\x98I am your\r\ndear son, whom the wild beasts were said to have torn from your arms;\r\nbut I am alive still, and will soon set you free.\xe2\x80\x99 Then he descended\r\nagain, and went to his father, and caused himself to be announced as a\r\nstrange huntsman, and asked if he could offer him service. The king said\r\nyes, if he was skilful and could get game for him, he should come to\r\nhim, but that deer had never taken up their quarters in any part of the\r\ndistrict or country. Then the huntsman promised to procure as much game\r\nfor him as he could possibly use at the royal table. So he summoned all\r\nthe huntsmen together, and bade them go out into the forest with him.\r\nAnd he went with them and made them form a great circle, open at one end\r\nwhere he stationed himself, and began to wish. Two hundred deer and more\r\ncame running inside the circle at once, and the huntsmen shot them.\r\nThen they were all placed on sixty country carts, and driven home to the\r\nking, and for once he was able to deck his table with game, after having\r\nhad none at all for years.\r\n\r\nNow the king felt great joy at this, and commanded that his entire\r\nhousehold should eat with him next day, and made a great feast. When\r\nthey were all assembled together, he said to the huntsman: \xe2\x80\x98As you are\r\nso clever, you shall sit by me.\xe2\x80\x99 He replied: \xe2\x80\x98Lord King, your majesty\r\nmust excuse me, I am a poor huntsman.\xe2\x80\x99 But the king insisted on it,\r\nand said: \xe2\x80\x98You shall sit by me,\xe2\x80\x99 until he did it. Whilst he was sitting\r\nthere, he thought of his dearest mother, and wished that one of the\r\nking\xe2\x80\x99s principal servants would begin to speak of her, and would ask how\r\nit was faring with the queen in the tower, and if she were alive still,\r\nor had perished. Hardly had he formed the wish than the marshal began,\r\nand said: \xe2\x80\x98Your majesty, we live joyously here, but how is the queen\r\nliving in the tower? Is she still alive, or has she died?\xe2\x80\x99 But the king\r\nreplied: \xe2\x80\x98She let my dear son be torn to pieces by wild beasts; I will\r\nnot have her named.\xe2\x80\x99 Then the huntsman arose and said: \xe2\x80\x98Gracious lord\r\nfather she is alive still, and I am her son, and I was not carried away\r\nby wild beasts, but by that wretch the old cook, who tore me from her\r\narms when she was asleep, and sprinkled her apron with the blood of a\r\nchicken.\xe2\x80\x99 Thereupon he took the dog with the golden collar, and said:\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That is the wretch!\xe2\x80\x99 and caused live coals to be brought, and these the\r\ndog was compelled to devour before the sight of all, until flames burst\r\nforth from its throat. On this the huntsman asked the king if he would\r\nlike to see the dog in his true shape, and wished him back into the form\r\nof the cook, in the which he stood immediately, with his white apron,\r\nand his knife by his side. When the king saw him he fell into a passion,\r\nand ordered him to be cast into the deepest dungeon. Then the huntsman\r\nspoke further and said: \xe2\x80\x98Father, will you see the maiden who brought me\r\nup so tenderly and who was afterwards to murder me, but did not do it,\r\nthough her own life depended on it?\xe2\x80\x99 The king replied: \xe2\x80\x98Yes, I would\r\nlike to see her.\xe2\x80\x99 The son said: \xe2\x80\x98Most gracious father, I will show her\r\nto you in the form of a beautiful flower,\xe2\x80\x99 and he thrust his hand into\r\nhis pocket and brought forth the pink, and placed it on the royal table,\r\nand it was so beautiful that the king had never seen one to equal it.\r\nThen the son said: \xe2\x80\x98Now will I show her to you in her own form,\xe2\x80\x99 and\r\nwished that she might become a maiden, and she stood there looking so\r\nbeautiful that no painter could have made her look more so.\r\n\r\nAnd the king sent two waiting-maids and two attendants into the tower,\r\nto fetch the queen and bring her to the royal table. But when she was\r\nled in she ate nothing, and said: \xe2\x80\x98The gracious and merciful God who has\r\nsupported me in the tower, will soon set me free.\xe2\x80\x99 She lived three days\r\nmore, and then died happily, and when she was buried, the two white\r\ndoves which had brought her food to the tower, and were angels of\r\nheaven, followed her body and seated themselves on her grave. The aged\r\nking ordered the cook to be torn in four pieces, but grief consumed the\r\nking\xe2\x80\x99s own heart, and he soon died. His son married the beautiful maiden\r\nwhom he had brought with him as a flower in his pocket, and whether they\r\nare still alive or not, is known to God.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCLEVER ELSIE\r\n\r\nThere was once a man who had a daughter who was called Clever Elsie. And\r\nwhen she had grown up her father said: \xe2\x80\x98We will get her married.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Yes,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsaid the mother, \xe2\x80\x98if only someone would come who would have her.\xe2\x80\x99 At\r\nlength a man came from a distance and wooed her, who was called Hans;\r\nbut he stipulated that Clever Elsie should be really smart. \xe2\x80\x98Oh,\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nthe father, \xe2\x80\x98she has plenty of good sense\xe2\x80\x99; and the mother said: \xe2\x80\x98Oh,\r\nshe can see the wind coming up the street, and hear the flies coughing.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well,\xe2\x80\x99 said Hans, \xe2\x80\x98if she is not really smart, I won\xe2\x80\x99t have her.\xe2\x80\x99 When\r\nthey were sitting at dinner and had eaten, the mother said: \xe2\x80\x98Elsie, go\r\ninto the cellar and fetch some beer.\xe2\x80\x99 Then Clever Elsie took the pitcher\r\nfrom the wall, went into the cellar, and tapped the lid briskly as she\r\nwent, so that the time might not appear long. When she was below she\r\nfetched herself a chair, and set it before the barrel so that she had\r\nno need to stoop, and did not hurt her back or do herself any unexpected\r\ninjury. Then she placed the can before her, and turned the tap, and\r\nwhile the beer was running she would not let her eyes be idle, but\r\nlooked up at the wall, and after much peering here and there, saw a\r\npick-axe exactly above her, which the masons had accidentally left\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nThen Clever Elsie began to weep and said: \xe2\x80\x98If I get Hans, and we have\r\na child, and he grows big, and we send him into the cellar here to draw\r\nbeer, then the pick-axe will fall on his head and kill him.\xe2\x80\x99 Then she\r\nsat and wept and screamed with all the strength of her body, over the\r\nmisfortune which lay before her. Those upstairs waited for the drink,\r\nbut Clever Elsie still did not come. Then the woman said to the servant:\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Just go down into the cellar and see where Elsie is.\xe2\x80\x99 The maid went and\r\nfound her sitting in front of the barrel, screaming loudly. \xe2\x80\x98Elsie why\r\ndo you weep?\xe2\x80\x99 asked the maid. \xe2\x80\x98Ah,\xe2\x80\x99 she answered, \xe2\x80\x98have I not reason to\r\nweep? If I get Hans, and we have a child, and he grows big, and has to\r\ndraw beer here, the pick-axe will perhaps fall on his head, and kill\r\nhim.\xe2\x80\x99 Then said the maid: \xe2\x80\x98What a clever Elsie we have!\xe2\x80\x99 and sat down\r\nbeside her and began loudly to weep over the misfortune. After a while,\r\nas the maid did not come back, and those upstairs were thirsty for the\r\nbeer, the man said to the boy: \xe2\x80\x98Just go down into the cellar and see\r\nwhere Elsie and the girl are.\xe2\x80\x99 The boy went down, and there sat Clever\r\nElsie and the girl both weeping together. Then he asked: \xe2\x80\x98Why are you\r\nweeping?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Ah,\xe2\x80\x99 said Elsie, \xe2\x80\x98have I not reason to weep? If I get Hans,\r\nand we have a child, and he grows big, and has to draw beer here, the\r\npick-axe will fall on his head and kill him.\xe2\x80\x99 Then said the boy: \xe2\x80\x98What\r\na clever Elsie we have!\xe2\x80\x99 and sat down by her, and likewise began to\r\nhowl loudly. Upstairs they waited for the boy, but as he still did not\r\nreturn, the man said to the woman: \xe2\x80\x98Just go down into the cellar and see\r\nwhere Elsie is!\xe2\x80\x99 The woman went down, and found all three in the midst\r\nof their lamentations, and inquired what was the cause; then Elsie told\r\nher also that her future child was to be killed by the pick-axe, when it\r\ngrew big and had to draw beer, and the pick-axe fell down. Then said the\r\nmother likewise: \xe2\x80\x98What a clever Elsie we have!\xe2\x80\x99 and sat down and wept\r\nwith them. The man upstairs waited a short time, but as his wife did not\r\ncome back and his thirst grew ever greater, he said: \xe2\x80\x98I must go into the\r\ncellar myself and see where Elsie is.\xe2\x80\x99 But when he got into the cellar,\r\nand they were all sitting together crying, and he heard the reason, and\r\nthat Elsie\xe2\x80\x99s child was the cause, and the Elsie might perhaps bring one\r\ninto the world some day, and that he might be killed by the pick-axe, if\r\nhe should happen to be sitting beneath it, drawing beer just at the very\r\ntime when it fell down, he cried: \xe2\x80\x98Oh, what a clever Elsie!\xe2\x80\x99 and sat\r\ndown, and likewise wept with them. The bridegroom stayed upstairs alone\r\nfor a long time; then as no one would come back he thought: \xe2\x80\x98They must be\r\nwaiting for me below: I too must go there and see what they are about.\xe2\x80\x99\r\nWhen he got down, the five of them were sitting screaming and lamenting\r\nquite piteously, each out-doing the other. \xe2\x80\x98What misfortune has happened\r\nthen?\xe2\x80\x99 asked he. \xe2\x80\x98Ah, dear Hans,\xe2\x80\x99 said Elsie, \xe2\x80\x98if we marry each other\r\nand have a child, and he is big, and we perhaps send him here to draw\r\nsomething to drink, then the pick-axe which has been left up there might\r\ndash his brains out if it were to fall down, so have we not reason to\r\nweep?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Come,\xe2\x80\x99 said Hans, \xe2\x80\x98more understanding than that is not needed\r\nfor my household, as you are such a clever Elsie, I will have you,\xe2\x80\x99 and\r\nseized her hand, took her upstairs with him, and married her.\r\n\r\nAfter Hans had had her some time, he said: \xe2\x80\x98Wife, I am going out to work\r\nand earn some money for us; go into the field and cut the corn that we\r\nmay have some bread.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Yes, dear Hans, I will do that.\xe2\x80\x99 After Hans had\r\ngone away, she cooked herself some good broth and took it into the field\r\nwith her. When she came to the field she said to herself: \xe2\x80\x98What shall I\r\ndo; shall I cut first, or shall I eat first? Oh, I will eat first.\xe2\x80\x99 Then\r\nshe drank her cup of broth and when she was fully satisfied, she once\r\nmore said: \xe2\x80\x98What shall I do? Shall I cut first, or shall I sleep first?\r\nI will sleep first.\xe2\x80\x99 Then she lay down among the corn and fell asleep.\r\nHans had been at home for a long time, but Elsie did not come; then said\r\nhe: \xe2\x80\x98What a clever Elsie I have; she is so industrious that she does not\r\neven come home to eat.\xe2\x80\x99 But when evening came and she still stayed away,\r\nHans went out to see what she had cut, but nothing was cut, and she\r\nwas lying among the corn asleep. Then Hans hastened home and brought\r\na fowler\xe2\x80\x99s net with little bells and hung it round about her, and she\r\nstill went on sleeping. Then he ran home, shut the house-door, and sat\r\ndown in his chair and worked. At length, when it was quite dark, Clever\r\nElsie awoke and when she got up there was a jingling all round about\r\nher, and the bells rang at each step which she took. Then she was\r\nalarmed, and became uncertain whether she really was Clever Elsie or\r\nnot, and said: \xe2\x80\x98Is it I, or is it not I?\xe2\x80\x99 But she knew not what answer\r\nto make to this, and stood for a time in doubt; at length she thought:\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I will go home and ask if it be I, or if it be not I, they will be sure\r\nto know.\xe2\x80\x99 She ran to the door of her own house, but it was shut; then\r\nshe knocked at the window and cried: \xe2\x80\x98Hans, is Elsie within?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Yes,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nanswered Hans, \xe2\x80\x98she is within.\xe2\x80\x99 Hereupon she was terrified, and said:\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah, heavens! Then it is not I,\xe2\x80\x99 and went to another door; but when the\r\npeople heard the jingling of the bells they would not open it, and she\r\ncould get in nowhere. Then she ran out of the village, and no one has\r\nseen her since.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MISER IN THE BUSH\r\n\r\nA farmer had a faithful and diligent servant, who had worked hard for\r\nhim three years, without having been paid any wages. At last it came\r\ninto the man\xe2\x80\x99s head that he would not go on thus without pay any longer;\r\nso he went to his master, and said, \xe2\x80\x98I have worked hard for you a long\r\ntime, I will trust to you to give me what I deserve to have for my\r\ntrouble.\xe2\x80\x99 The farmer was a sad miser, and knew that his man was very\r\nsimple-hearted; so he took out threepence, and gave him for every year\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nservice a penny. The poor fellow thought it was a great deal of money to\r\nhave, and said to himself, \xe2\x80\x98Why should I work hard, and live here on bad\r\nfare any longer? I can now travel into the wide world, and make myself\r\nmerry.\xe2\x80\x99 With that he put his money into his purse, and set out, roaming\r\nover hill and valley.\r\n\r\nAs he jogged along over the fields, singing and dancing, a little dwarf\r\nmet him, and asked him what made him so merry. \xe2\x80\x98Why, what should make\r\nme down-hearted?\xe2\x80\x99 said he; \xe2\x80\x98I am sound in health and rich in purse, what\r\nshould I care for? I have saved up my three years\xe2\x80\x99 earnings and have it\r\nall safe in my pocket.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98How much may it come to?\xe2\x80\x99 said the little man.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Full threepence,\xe2\x80\x99 replied the countryman. \xe2\x80\x98I wish you would give them\r\nto me,\xe2\x80\x99 said the other; \xe2\x80\x98I am very poor.\xe2\x80\x99 Then the man pitied him, and\r\ngave him all he had; and the little dwarf said in return, \xe2\x80\x98As you have\r\nsuch a kind honest heart, I will grant you three wishes--one for every\r\npenny; so choose whatever you like.\xe2\x80\x99 Then the countryman rejoiced at\r\nhis good luck, and said, \xe2\x80\x98I like many things better than money: first, I\r\nwill have a bow that will bring down everything I shoot at; secondly,\r\na fiddle that will set everyone dancing that hears me play upon it; and\r\nthirdly, I should like that everyone should grant what I ask.\xe2\x80\x99 The dwarf\r\nsaid he should have his three wishes; so he gave him the bow and fiddle,\r\nand went his way.\r\n\r\nOur honest friend journeyed on his way too; and if he was merry before,\r\nhe was now ten times more so. He had not gone far before he met an old\r\nmiser: close by them stood a tree, and on the topmost twig sat a thrush\r\nsinging away most joyfully. \xe2\x80\x98Oh, what a pretty bird!\xe2\x80\x99 said the miser; \xe2\x80\x98I\r\nwould give a great deal of money to have such a one.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98If that\xe2\x80\x99s all,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsaid the countryman, \xe2\x80\x98I will soon bring it down.\xe2\x80\x99 Then he took up his\r\nbow, and down fell the thrush into the bushes at the foot of the tree.\r\nThe miser crept into the bush to find it; but directly he had got into\r\nthe middle, his companion took up his fiddle and played away, and the\r\nmiser began to dance and spring about, capering higher and higher in\r\nthe air. The thorns soon began to tear his clothes till they all hung\r\nin rags about him, and he himself was all scratched and wounded, so that\r\nthe blood ran down. \xe2\x80\x98Oh, for heaven\xe2\x80\x99s sake!\xe2\x80\x99 cried the miser, \xe2\x80\x98Master!\r\nmaster! pray let the fiddle alone. What have I done to deserve this?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Thou hast shaved many a poor soul close enough,\xe2\x80\x99 said the other; \xe2\x80\x98thou\r\nart only meeting thy reward\xe2\x80\x99: so he played up another tune. Then the\r\nmiser began to beg and promise, and offered money for his liberty; but\r\nhe did not come up to the musician\xe2\x80\x99s price for some time, and he danced\r\nhim along brisker and brisker, and the miser bid higher and higher, till\r\nat last he offered a round hundred of florins that he had in his purse,\r\nand had just gained by cheating some poor fellow. When the countryman\r\nsaw so much money, he said, \xe2\x80\x98I will agree to your proposal.\xe2\x80\x99 So he took\r\nthe purse, put up his fiddle, and travelled on very pleased with his\r\nbargain.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the miser crept out of the bush half-naked and in a piteous\r\nplight, and began to ponder how he should take his revenge, and serve\r\nhis late companion some trick. At last he went to the judge, and\r\ncomplained that a rascal had robbed him of his money, and beaten him\r\ninto the bargain; and that the fellow who did it carried a bow at his\r\nback and a fiddle hung round his neck. Then the judge sent out his\r\nofficers to bring up the accused wherever they should find him; and he\r\nwas soon caught and brought up to be tried.\r\n\r\nThe miser began to tell his tale, and said he had been robbed of\r\nhis money. \xe2\x80\x98No, you gave it me for playing a tune to you.\xe2\x80\x99 said the\r\ncountryman; but the judge told him that was not likely, and cut the\r\nmatter short by ordering him off to the gallows.\r\n\r\nSo away he was taken; but as he stood on the steps he said, \xe2\x80\x98My Lord\r\nJudge, grant me one last request.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Anything but thy life,\xe2\x80\x99 replied the\r\nother. \xe2\x80\x98No,\xe2\x80\x99 said he, \xe2\x80\x98I do not ask my life; only to let me play upon\r\nmy fiddle for the last time.\xe2\x80\x99 The miser cried out, \xe2\x80\x98Oh, no! no! for\r\nheaven\xe2\x80\x99s sake don\xe2\x80\x99t listen to him! don\xe2\x80\x99t listen to him!\xe2\x80\x99 But the judge\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x98It is only this once, he will soon have done.\xe2\x80\x99 The fact was, he\r\ncould not refuse the request, on account of the dwarf\xe2\x80\x99s third gift.\r\n\r\nThen the miser said, \xe2\x80\x98Bind me fast, bind me fast, for pity\xe2\x80\x99s sake.\xe2\x80\x99 But\r\nthe countryman seized his fiddle, and struck up a tune, and at the first\r\nnote judge, clerks, and jailer were in motion; all began capering, and\r\nno one could hold the miser. At the second note the hangman let his\r\nprisoner go, and danced also, and by the time he had played the first\r\nbar of the tune, all were dancing together--judge, court, and miser, and\r\nall the people who had followed to look on. At first the thing was merry\r\nand pleasant enough; but when it had gone on a while, and there seemed\r\nto be no end of playing or dancing, they began to cry out, and beg him\r\nto leave off; but he stopped not a whit the more for their entreaties,\r\ntill the judge not only gave him his life, but promised to return him\r\nthe hundred florins.\r\n\r\nThen he called to the miser, and said, \xe2\x80\x98Tell us now, you vagabond, where\r\nyou got that gold, or I shall play on for your amusement only,\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98I stole\r\nit,\xe2\x80\x99 said the miser in the presence of all the people; \xe2\x80\x98I acknowledge\r\nthat I stole it, and that you earned it fairly.\xe2\x80\x99 Then the countryman\r\nstopped his fiddle, and left the miser to take his place at the gallows.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nASHPUTTEL\r\n\r\nThe wife of a rich man fell sick; and when she felt that her end drew\r\nnigh, she called her only daughter to her bed-side, and said, \xe2\x80\x98Always be\r\na good girl, and I will look down from heaven and watch over you.\xe2\x80\x99 Soon\r\nafterwards she shut her eyes and died, and was buried in the garden;\r\nand the little girl went every day to her grave and wept, and was always\r\ngood and kind to all about her. And the snow fell and spread a beautiful\r\nwhite covering over the grave; but by the time the spring came, and the\r\nsun had melted it away again, her father had married another wife. This\r\nnew wife had two daughters of her own, that she brought home with her;\r\nthey were fair in face but foul at heart, and it was now a sorry time\r\nfor the poor little girl. \xe2\x80\x98What does the good-for-nothing want in the\r\nparlour?\xe2\x80\x99 said they; \xe2\x80\x98they who would eat bread should first earn it;\r\naway with the kitchen-maid!\xe2\x80\x99 Then they took away her fine clothes, and\r\ngave her an old grey frock to put on, and laughed at her, and turned her\r\ninto the kitchen.\r\n\r\nThere she was forced to do hard work; to rise early before daylight, to\r\nbring the water, to make the fire, to cook and to wash. Besides that,\r\nthe sisters plagued her in all sorts of ways, and laughed at her. In the\r\nevening when she was tired, she had no bed to lie down on, but was made\r\nto lie by the hearth among the ashes; and as this, of course, made her\r\nalways dusty and dirty, they called her Ashputtel.\r\n\r\nIt happened once that the father was going to the fair, and asked his\r\nwife\xe2\x80\x99s daughters what he should bring them. \xe2\x80\x98Fine clothes,\xe2\x80\x99 said the\r\nfirst; \xe2\x80\x98Pearls and diamonds,\xe2\x80\x99 cried the second. \xe2\x80\x98Now, child,\xe2\x80\x99 said he\r\nto his own daughter, \xe2\x80\x98what will you have?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98The first twig, dear\r\nfather, that brushes against your hat when you turn your face to come\r\nhomewards,\xe2\x80\x99 said she. Then he bought for the first two the fine clothes\r\nand pearls and diamonds they had asked for: and on his way home, as he\r\nrode through a green copse, a hazel twig brushed against him, and almost\r\npushed off his hat: so he broke it off and brought it away; and when he\r\ngot home he gave it to his daughter. Then she took it, and went to\r\nher mother\xe2\x80\x99s grave and planted it there; and cried so much that it was\r\nwatered with her tears; and there it grew and became a fine tree. Three\r\ntimes every day she went to it and cried; and soon a little bird came\r\nand built its nest upon the tree, and talked with her, and watched over\r\nher, and brought her whatever she wished for.\r\n\r\nNow it happened that the king of that land held a feast, which was to\r\nlast three days; and out of those who came to it his son was to choose\r\na bride for himself. Ashputtel\xe2\x80\x99s two sisters were asked to come; so they\r\ncalled her up, and said, \xe2\x80\x98Now, comb our hair, brush our shoes, and tie\r\nour sashes for us, for we are going to dance at the king\xe2\x80\x99s feast.\xe2\x80\x99\r\nThen she did as she was told; but when all was done she could not help\r\ncrying, for she thought to herself, she should so have liked to have\r\ngone with them to the ball; and at last she begged her mother very hard\r\nto let her go. \xe2\x80\x98You, Ashputtel!\xe2\x80\x99 said she; \xe2\x80\x98you who have nothing to\r\nwear, no clothes at all, and who cannot even dance--you want to go to\r\nthe ball? And when she kept on begging, she said at last, to get rid of\r\nher, \xe2\x80\x98I will throw this dishful of peas into the ash-heap, and if in\r\ntwo hours\xe2\x80\x99 time you have picked them all out, you shall go to the feast\r\ntoo.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThen she threw the peas down among the ashes, but the little maiden ran\r\nout at the back door into the garden, and cried out:\r\n\r\n \xe2\x80\x98Hither, hither, through the sky,\r\n  Turtle-doves and linnets, fly!\r\n  Blackbird, thrush, and chaffinch gay,\r\n  Hither, hither, haste away!\r\n  One and all come help me, quick!\r\n  Haste ye, haste ye!--pick, pick, pick!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThen first came two white doves, flying in at the kitchen window; next\r\ncame two turtle-doves; and after them came all the little birds under\r\nheaven, chirping and fluttering in: and they flew down into the ashes.\r\nAnd the little doves stooped their heads down and set to work, pick,\r\npick, pick; and then the others began to pick, pick, pick: and among\r\nthem all they soon picked out all the good grain, and put it into a dish\r\nbut left the ashes. Long before the end of the hour the work was quite\r\ndone, and all flew out again at the windows.\r\n\r\nThen Ashputtel brought the dish to her mother, overjoyed at the thought\r\nthat now she should go to the ball. But the mother said, \xe2\x80\x98No, no! you\r\nslut, you have no clothes, and cannot dance; you shall not go.\xe2\x80\x99 And when\r\nAshputtel begged very hard to go, she said, \xe2\x80\x98If you can in one hour\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntime pick two of those dishes of peas out of the ashes, you shall go\r\ntoo.\xe2\x80\x99 And thus she thought she should at least get rid of her. So she\r\nshook two dishes of peas into the ashes.\r\n\r\nBut the little maiden went out into the garden at the back of the house,\r\nand cried out as before:\r\n\r\n \xe2\x80\x98Hither, hither, through the sky,\r\n  Turtle-doves and linnets, fly!\r\n  Blackbird, thrush, and chaffinch gay,\r\n  Hither, hither, haste away!\r\n  One and all come help me, quick!\r\n  Haste ye, haste ye!--pick, pick, pick!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThen first came two white doves in at the kitchen window; next came two\r\nturtle-doves; and after them came all the little birds under heaven,\r\nchirping and hopping about. And they flew down into the ashes; and the\r\nlittle doves put their heads down and set to work, pick, pick, pick; and\r\nthen the others began pick, pick, pick; and they put all the good grain\r\ninto the dishes, and left all the ashes. Before half an hour\xe2\x80\x99s time all\r\nwas done, and out they flew again. And then Ashputtel took the dishes to\r\nher mother, rejoicing to think that she should now go to the ball.\r\nBut her mother said, \xe2\x80\x98It is all of no use, you cannot go; you have no\r\nclothes, and cannot dance, and you would only put us to shame\xe2\x80\x99: and off\r\nshe went with her two daughters to the ball.\r\n\r\nNow when all were gone, and nobody left at home, Ashputtel went\r\nsorrowfully and sat down under the hazel-tree, and cried out:\r\n\r\n \xe2\x80\x98Shake, shake, hazel-tree,\r\n  Gold and silver over me!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThen her friend the bird flew out of the tree, and brought a gold and\r\nsilver dress for her, and slippers of spangled silk; and she put them\r\non, and followed her sisters to the feast. But they did not know her,\r\nand thought it must be some strange princess, she looked so fine and\r\nbeautiful in her rich clothes; and they never once thought of Ashputtel,\r\ntaking it for granted that she was safe at home in the dirt.\r\n\r\nThe king\xe2\x80\x99s son soon came up to her, and took her by the hand and danced\r\nwith her, and no one else: and he never left her hand; but when anyone\r\nelse came to ask her to dance, he said, \xe2\x80\x98This lady is dancing with me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThus they danced till a late hour of the night; and then she wanted to\r\ngo home: and the king\xe2\x80\x99s son said, \xe2\x80\x98I shall go and take care of you to\r\nyour home\xe2\x80\x99; for he wanted to see where the beautiful maiden lived. But\r\nshe slipped away from him, unawares, and ran off towards home; and as\r\nthe prince followed her, she jumped up into the pigeon-house and shut\r\nthe door. Then he waited till her father came home, and told him that\r\nthe unknown maiden, who had been at the feast, had hid herself in the\r\npigeon-house. But when they had broken open the door they found no one\r\nwithin; and as they came back into the house, Ashputtel was lying, as\r\nshe always did, in her dirty frock by the ashes, and her dim little\r\nlamp was burning in the chimney. For she had run as quickly as she could\r\nthrough the pigeon-house and on to the hazel-tree, and had there taken\r\noff her beautiful clothes, and put them beneath the tree, that the bird\r\nmight carry them away, and had lain down again amid the ashes in her\r\nlittle grey frock.\r\n\r\nThe next day when the feast was again held, and her father, mother, and\r\nsisters were gone, Ashputtel went to the hazel-tree, and said:\r\n\r\n \xe2\x80\x98Shake, shake, hazel-tree,\r\n  Gold and silver over me!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAnd the bird came and brought a still finer dress than the one she\r\nhad worn the day before. And when she came in it to the ball, everyone\r\nwondered at her beauty: but the king\xe2\x80\x99s son, who was waiting for her,\r\ntook her by the hand, and danced with her; and when anyone asked her to\r\ndance, he said as before, \xe2\x80\x98This lady is dancing with me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWhen night came she wanted to go home; and the king\xe2\x80\x99s son followed here\r\nas before, that he might see into what house she went: but she sprang\r\naway from him all at once into the garden behind her father\xe2\x80\x99s house.\r\nIn this garden stood a fine large pear-tree full of ripe fruit; and\r\nAshputtel, not knowing where to hide herself, jumped up into it without\r\nbeing seen. Then the king\xe2\x80\x99s son lost sight of her, and could not find\r\nout where she was gone, but waited till her father came home, and said\r\nto him, \xe2\x80\x98The unknown lady who danced with me has slipped away, and I\r\nthink she must have sprung into the pear-tree.\xe2\x80\x99 The father thought to\r\nhimself, \xe2\x80\x98Can it be Ashputtel?\xe2\x80\x99 So he had an axe brought; and they cut\r\ndown the tree, but found no one upon it. And when they came back into\r\nthe kitchen, there lay Ashputtel among the ashes; for she had slipped\r\ndown on the other side of the tree, and carried her beautiful clothes\r\nback to the bird at the hazel-tree, and then put on her little grey\r\nfrock.\r\n\r\nThe third day, when her father and mother and sisters were gone, she\r\nwent again into the garden, and said:\r\n\r\n \xe2\x80\x98Shake, shake, hazel-tree,\r\n  Gold and silver over me!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThen her kind friend the bird brought a dress still finer than the\r\nformer one, and slippers which were all of gold: so that when she came\r\nto the feast no one knew what to say, for wonder at her beauty: and the\r\nking\xe2\x80\x99s son danced with nobody but her; and when anyone else asked her to\r\ndance, he said, \xe2\x80\x98This lady is _my_ partner, sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWhen night came she wanted to go home; and the king\xe2\x80\x99s son would go with\r\nher, and said to himself, \xe2\x80\x98I will not lose her this time\xe2\x80\x99; but, however,\r\nshe again slipped away from him, though in such a hurry that she dropped\r\nher left golden slipper upon the stairs.\r\n\r\nThe prince took the shoe, and went the next day to the king his father,\r\nand said, \xe2\x80\x98I will take for my wife the lady that this golden slipper\r\nfits.\xe2\x80\x99 Then both the sisters were overjoyed to hear it; for they\r\nhad beautiful feet, and had no doubt that they could wear the golden\r\nslipper. The eldest went first into the room where the slipper was, and\r\nwanted to try it on, and the mother stood by. But her great toe could\r\nnot go into it, and the shoe was altogether much too small for her. Then\r\nthe mother gave her a knife, and said, \xe2\x80\x98Never mind, cut it off; when you\r\nare queen you will not care about toes; you will not want to walk.\xe2\x80\x99 So\r\nthe silly girl cut off her great toe, and thus squeezed on the shoe,\r\nand went to the king\xe2\x80\x99s son. Then he took her for his bride, and set her\r\nbeside him on his horse, and rode away with her homewards.\r\n\r\nBut on their way home they had to pass by the hazel-tree that Ashputtel\r\nhad planted; and on the branch sat a little dove singing:\r\n\r\n \xe2\x80\x98Back again! back again! look to the shoe!\r\n  The shoe is too small, and not made for you!\r\n  Prince! prince! look again for thy bride,\r\n  For she\xe2\x80\x99s not the true one that sits by thy side.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThen the prince got down and looked at her foot; and he saw, by the\r\nblood that streamed from it, what a trick she had played him. So he\r\nturned his horse round, and brought the false bride back to her home,\r\nand said, \xe2\x80\x98This is not the right bride; let the other sister try and put\r\non the slipper.\xe2\x80\x99 Then she went into the room and got her foot into the\r\nshoe, all but the heel, which was too large. But her mother squeezed it\r\nin till the blood came, and took her to the king\xe2\x80\x99s son: and he set her\r\nas his bride by his side on his horse, and rode away with her.\r\n\r\nBut when they came to the hazel-tree the little dove sat there still,\r\nand sang:\r\n\r\n \xe2\x80\x98Back again! back again! look to the shoe!\r\n  The shoe is too small, and not made for you!\r\n  Prince! prince! look again for thy bride,\r\n  For she\xe2\x80\x99s not the true one that sits by thy side.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThen he looked down, and saw that the blood streamed so much from the\r\nshoe, that her white stockings were quite red. So he turned his horse\r\nand brought her also back again. \xe2\x80\x98This is not the true bride,\xe2\x80\x99 said he\r\nto the father; \xe2\x80\x98have you no other daughters?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98No,\xe2\x80\x99 said he; \xe2\x80\x98there is\r\nonly a little dirty Ashputtel here, the child of my first wife; I am\r\nsure she cannot be the bride.\xe2\x80\x99 The prince told him to send her. But the\r\nmother said, \xe2\x80\x98No, no, she is much too dirty; she will not dare to show\r\nherself.\xe2\x80\x99 However, the prince would have her come; and she first washed\r\nher face and hands, and then went in and curtsied to him, and he reached\r\nher the golden slipper. Then she took her clumsy shoe off her left foot,\r\nand put on the golden slipper; and it fitted her as if it had been made\r\nfor her. And when he drew near and looked at her face he knew her, and\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x98This is the right bride.\xe2\x80\x99 But the mother and both the sisters\r\nwere frightened, and turned pale with anger as he took Ashputtel on his\r\nhorse, and rode away with her. And when they came to the hazel-tree, the\r\nwhite dove sang:\r\n\r\n \xe2\x80\x98Home! home! look at the shoe!\r\n  Princess! the shoe was made for you!\r\n  Prince! prince! take home thy bride,\r\n  For she is the true one that sits by thy side!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAnd when the dove had done its song, it came flying, and perched upon\r\nher right shoulder, and so went home with her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WHITE SNAKE\r\n\r\nA long time ago there lived a king who was famed for his wisdom through\r\nall the land. Nothing was hidden from him, and it seemed as if news of\r\nthe most secret things was brought to him through the air. But he had a\r\nstrange custom; every day after dinner, when the table was cleared,\r\nand no one else was present, a trusty servant had to bring him one more\r\ndish. It was covered, however, and even the servant did not know what\r\nwas in it, neither did anyone know, for the king never took off the\r\ncover to eat of it until he was quite alone.\r\n\r\nThis had gone on for a long time, when one day the servant, who took\r\naway the dish, was overcome with such curiosity that he could not help\r\ncarrying the dish into his room. When he had carefully locked the door,\r\nhe lifted up the cover, and saw a white snake lying on the dish. But\r\nwhen he saw it he could not deny himself the pleasure of tasting it,\r\nso he cut of a little bit and put it into his mouth. No sooner had it\r\ntouched his tongue than he heard a strange whispering of little voices\r\noutside his window. He went and listened, and then noticed that it was\r\nthe sparrows who were chattering together, and telling one another of\r\nall kinds of things which they had seen in the fields and woods. Eating\r\nthe snake had given him power of understanding the language of animals.\r\n\r\nNow it so happened that on this very day the queen lost her most\r\nbeautiful ring, and suspicion of having stolen it fell upon this trusty\r\nservant, who was allowed to go everywhere. The king ordered the man to\r\nbe brought before him, and threatened with angry words that unless he\r\ncould before the morrow point out the thief, he himself should be looked\r\nupon as guilty and executed. In vain he declared his innocence; he was\r\ndismissed with no better answer.\r\n\r\nIn his trouble and fear he went down into the courtyard and took thought\r\nhow to help himself out of his trouble. Now some ducks were sitting\r\ntogether quietly by a brook and taking their rest; and, whilst they\r\nwere making their feathers smooth with their bills, they were having a\r\nconfidential conversation together. The servant stood by and listened.\r\nThey were telling one another of all the places where they had been\r\nwaddling about all the morning, and what good food they had found; and\r\none said in a pitiful tone: \xe2\x80\x98Something lies heavy on my stomach; as\r\nI was eating in haste I swallowed a ring which lay under the queen\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwindow.\xe2\x80\x99 The servant at once seized her by the neck, carried her to the\r\nkitchen, and said to the cook: \xe2\x80\x98Here is a fine duck; pray, kill her.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes,\xe2\x80\x99 said the cook, and weighed her in his hand; \xe2\x80\x98she has spared\r\nno trouble to fatten herself, and has been waiting to be roasted long\r\nenough.\xe2\x80\x99 So he cut off her head, and as she was being dressed for the\r\nspit, the queen\xe2\x80\x99s ring was found inside her.\r\n\r\nThe servant could now easily prove his innocence; and the king, to make\r\namends for the wrong, allowed him to ask a favour, and promised him\r\nthe best place in the court that he could wish for. The servant refused\r\neverything, and only asked for a horse and some money for travelling, as\r\nhe had a mind to see the world and go about a little. When his request\r\nwas granted he set out on his way, and one day came to a pond, where he\r\nsaw three fishes caught in the reeds and gasping for water. Now, though\r\nit is said that fishes are dumb, he heard them lamenting that they must\r\nperish so miserably, and, as he had a kind heart, he got off his\r\nhorse and put the three prisoners back into the water. They leapt with\r\ndelight, put out their heads, and cried to him: \xe2\x80\x98We will remember you\r\nand repay you for saving us!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe rode on, and after a while it seemed to him that he heard a voice in\r\nthe sand at his feet. He listened, and heard an ant-king complain: \xe2\x80\x98Why\r\ncannot folks, with their clumsy beasts, keep off our bodies? That stupid\r\nhorse, with his heavy hoofs, has been treading down my people without\r\nmercy!\xe2\x80\x99 So he turned on to a side path and the ant-king cried out to\r\nhim: \xe2\x80\x98We will remember you--one good turn deserves another!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe path led him into a wood, and there he saw two old ravens standing\r\nby their nest, and throwing out their young ones. \xe2\x80\x98Out with you, you\r\nidle, good-for-nothing creatures!\xe2\x80\x99 cried they; \xe2\x80\x98we cannot find food for\r\nyou any longer; you are big enough, and can provide for yourselves.\xe2\x80\x99\r\nBut the poor young ravens lay upon the ground, flapping their wings, and\r\ncrying: \xe2\x80\x98Oh, what helpless chicks we are! We must shift for ourselves,\r\nand yet we cannot fly! What can we do, but lie here and starve?\xe2\x80\x99 So the\r\ngood young fellow alighted and killed his horse with his sword, and gave\r\nit to them for food. Then they came hopping up to it, satisfied their\r\nhunger, and cried: \xe2\x80\x98We will remember you--one good turn deserves\r\nanother!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAnd now he had to use his own legs, and when he had walked a long\r\nway, he came to a large city. There was a great noise and crowd in\r\nthe streets, and a man rode up on horseback, crying aloud: \xe2\x80\x98The king\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndaughter wants a husband; but whoever seeks her hand must perform a hard\r\ntask, and if he does not succeed he will forfeit his life.\xe2\x80\x99 Many had\r\nalready made the attempt, but in vain; nevertheless when the youth\r\nsaw the king\xe2\x80\x99s daughter he was so overcome by her great beauty that he\r\nforgot all danger, went before the king, and declared himself a suitor.\r\n\r\nSo he was led out to the sea, and a gold ring was thrown into it, before\r\nhis eyes; then the king ordered him to fetch this ring up from the\r\nbottom of the sea, and added: \xe2\x80\x98If you come up again without it you will\r\nbe thrown in again and again until you perish amid the waves.\xe2\x80\x99 All the\r\npeople grieved for the handsome youth; then they went away, leaving him\r\nalone by the sea.\r\n\r\nHe stood on the shore and considered what he should do, when suddenly\r\nhe saw three fishes come swimming towards him, and they were the very\r\nfishes whose lives he had saved. The one in the middle held a mussel in\r\nits mouth, which it laid on the shore at the youth\xe2\x80\x99s feet, and when he\r\nhad taken it up and opened it, there lay the gold ring in the shell.\r\nFull of joy he took it to the king and expected that he would grant him\r\nthe promised reward.\r\n\r\nBut when the proud princess perceived that he was not her equal in\r\nbirth, she scorned him, and required him first to perform another\r\ntask. She went down into the garden and strewed with her own hands ten\r\nsacksful of millet-seed on the grass; then she said: \xe2\x80\x98Tomorrow morning\r\nbefore sunrise these must be picked up, and not a single grain be\r\nwanting.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe youth sat down in the garden and considered how it might be possible\r\nto perform this task, but he could think of nothing, and there he sat\r\nsorrowfully awaiting the break of day, when he should be led to death.\r\nBut as soon as the first rays of the sun shone into the garden he saw\r\nall the ten sacks standing side by side, quite full, and not a single\r\ngrain was missing. The ant-king had come in the night with thousands\r\nand thousands of ants, and the grateful creatures had by great industry\r\npicked up all the millet-seed and gathered them into the sacks.\r\n\r\nPresently the king\xe2\x80\x99s daughter herself came down into the garden, and was\r\namazed to see that the young man had done the task she had given him.\r\nBut she could not yet conquer her proud heart, and said: \xe2\x80\x98Although he\r\nhas performed both the tasks, he shall not be my husband until he had\r\nbrought me an apple from the Tree of Life.\xe2\x80\x99 The youth did not know where\r\nthe Tree of Life stood, but he set out, and would have gone on for ever,\r\nas long as his legs would carry him, though he had no hope of finding\r\nit. After he had wandered through three kingdoms, he came one evening to\r\na wood, and lay down under a tree to sleep. But he heard a rustling in\r\nthe branches, and a golden apple fell into his hand. At the same time\r\nthree ravens flew down to him, perched themselves upon his knee, and\r\nsaid: \xe2\x80\x98We are the three young ravens whom you saved from starving; when\r\nwe had grown big, and heard that you were seeking the Golden Apple,\r\nwe flew over the sea to the end of the world, where the Tree of Life\r\nstands, and have brought you the apple.\xe2\x80\x99 The youth, full of joy, set out\r\nhomewards, and took the Golden Apple to the king\xe2\x80\x99s beautiful daughter,\r\nwho had now no more excuses left to make. They cut the Apple of Life in\r\ntwo and ate it together; and then her heart became full of love for him,\r\nand they lived in undisturbed happiness to a great age.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WOLF AND THE SEVEN LITTLE KIDS\r\n\r\nThere was once upon a time an old goat who had seven little kids, and\r\nloved them with all the love of a mother for her children. One day she\r\nwanted to go into the forest and fetch some food. So she called all\r\nseven to her and said: \xe2\x80\x98Dear children, I have to go into the forest,\r\nbe on your guard against the wolf; if he comes in, he will devour you\r\nall--skin, hair, and everything. The wretch often disguises himself, but\r\nyou will know him at once by his rough voice and his black feet.\xe2\x80\x99 The\r\nkids said: \xe2\x80\x98Dear mother, we will take good care of ourselves; you may go\r\naway without any anxiety.\xe2\x80\x99 Then the old one bleated, and went on her way\r\nwith an easy mind.\r\n\r\nIt was not long before someone knocked at the house-door and called:\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Open the door, dear children; your mother is here, and has brought\r\nsomething back with her for each of you.\xe2\x80\x99 But the little kids knew that\r\nit was the wolf, by the rough voice. \xe2\x80\x98We will not open the door,\xe2\x80\x99 cried\r\nthey, \xe2\x80\x98you are not our mother. She has a soft, pleasant voice, but\r\nyour voice is rough; you are the wolf!\xe2\x80\x99 Then the wolf went away to a\r\nshopkeeper and bought himself a great lump of chalk, ate this and made\r\nhis voice soft with it. Then he came back, knocked at the door of the\r\nhouse, and called: \xe2\x80\x98Open the door, dear children, your mother is here\r\nand has brought something back with her for each of you.\xe2\x80\x99 But the wolf\r\nhad laid his black paws against the window, and the children saw them\r\nand cried: \xe2\x80\x98We will not open the door, our mother has not black feet\r\nlike you: you are the wolf!\xe2\x80\x99 Then the wolf ran to a baker and said: \xe2\x80\x98I\r\nhave hurt my feet, rub some dough over them for me.\xe2\x80\x99 And when the baker\r\nhad rubbed his feet over, he ran to the miller and said: \xe2\x80\x98Strew some\r\nwhite meal over my feet for me.\xe2\x80\x99 The miller thought to himself: \xe2\x80\x98The\r\nwolf wants to deceive someone,\xe2\x80\x99 and refused; but the wolf said: \xe2\x80\x98If you\r\nwill not do it, I will devour you.\xe2\x80\x99 Then the miller was afraid, and made\r\nhis paws white for him. Truly, this is the way of mankind.\r\n\r\nSo now the wretch went for the third time to the house-door, knocked at\r\nit and said: \xe2\x80\x98Open the door for me, children, your dear little mother\r\nhas come home, and has brought every one of you something back from the\r\nforest with her.\xe2\x80\x99 The little kids cried: \xe2\x80\x98First show us your paws that\r\nwe may know if you are our dear little mother.\xe2\x80\x99 Then he put his paws\r\nin through the window and when the kids saw that they were white, they\r\nbelieved that all he said was true, and opened the door. But who should\r\ncome in but the wolf! They were terrified and wanted to hide themselves.\r\nOne sprang under the table, the second into the bed, the third into the\r\nstove, the fourth into the kitchen, the fifth into the cupboard, the\r\nsixth under the washing-bowl, and the seventh into the clock-case. But\r\nthe wolf found them all, and used no great ceremony; one after the\r\nother he swallowed them down his throat. The youngest, who was in\r\nthe clock-case, was the only one he did not find. When the wolf had\r\nsatisfied his appetite he took himself off, laid himself down under a\r\ntree in the green meadow outside, and began to sleep. Soon afterwards\r\nthe old goat came home again from the forest. Ah! what a sight she saw\r\nthere! The house-door stood wide open. The table, chairs, and benches\r\nwere thrown down, the washing-bowl lay broken to pieces, and the quilts\r\nand pillows were pulled off the bed. She sought her children, but they\r\nwere nowhere to be found. She called them one after another by name, but\r\nno one answered. At last, when she came to the youngest, a soft voice\r\ncried: \xe2\x80\x98Dear mother, I am in the clock-case.\xe2\x80\x99 She took the kid out, and\r\nit told her that the wolf had come and had eaten all the others. Then\r\nyou may imagine how she wept over her poor children.\r\n\r\nAt length in her grief she went out, and the youngest kid ran with her.\r\nWhen they came to the meadow, there lay the wolf by the tree and snored\r\nso loud that the branches shook. She looked at him on every side and\r\nsaw that something was moving and struggling in his gorged belly. \xe2\x80\x98Ah,\r\nheavens,\xe2\x80\x99 she said, \xe2\x80\x98is it possible that my poor children whom he has\r\nswallowed down for his supper, can be still alive?\xe2\x80\x99 Then the kid had to\r\nrun home and fetch scissors, and a needle and thread, and the goat cut\r\nopen the monster\xe2\x80\x99s stomach, and hardly had she made one cut, than one\r\nlittle kid thrust its head out, and when she had cut farther, all six\r\nsprang out one after another, and were all still alive, and had suffered\r\nno injury whatever, for in his greediness the monster had swallowed them\r\ndown whole. What rejoicing there was! They embraced their dear mother,\r\nand jumped like a tailor at his wedding. The mother, however, said: \xe2\x80\x98Now\r\ngo and look for some big stones, and we will fill the wicked beast\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nstomach with them while he is still asleep.\xe2\x80\x99 Then the seven kids dragged\r\nthe stones thither with all speed, and put as many of them into this\r\nstomach as they could get in; and the mother sewed him up again in the\r\ngreatest haste, so that he was not aware of anything and never once\r\nstirred.\r\n\r\nWhen the wolf at length had had his fill of sleep, he got on his legs,\r\nand as the stones in his stomach made him very thirsty, he wanted to\r\ngo to a well to drink. But when he began to walk and to move about, the\r\nstones in his stomach knocked against each other and rattled. Then cried\r\nhe:\r\n\r\n \xe2\x80\x98What rumbles and tumbles\r\n  Against my poor bones?\r\n  I thought \xe2\x80\x98twas six kids,\r\n  But it feels like big stones.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAnd when he got to the well and stooped over the water to drink, the\r\nheavy stones made him fall in, and he drowned miserably. When the seven\r\nkids saw that, they came running to the spot and cried aloud: \xe2\x80\x98The wolf\r\nis dead! The wolf is dead!\xe2\x80\x99 and danced for joy round about the well with\r\ntheir mother.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE QUEEN BEE\r\n\r\nTwo kings\xe2\x80\x99 sons once upon a time went into the world to seek their\r\nfortunes; but they soon fell into a wasteful foolish way of living, so\r\nthat they could not return home again. Then their brother, who was a\r\nlittle insignificant dwarf, went out to seek for his brothers: but when\r\nhe had found them they only laughed at him, to think that he, who was so\r\nyoung and simple, should try to travel through the world, when they, who\r\nwere so much wiser, had been unable to get on. However, they all set\r\nout on their journey together, and came at last to an ant-hill. The two\r\nelder brothers would have pulled it down, in order to see how the poor\r\nants in their fright would run about and carry off their eggs. But the\r\nlittle dwarf said, \xe2\x80\x98Let the poor things enjoy themselves, I will not\r\nsuffer you to trouble them.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSo on they went, and came to a lake where many many ducks were swimming\r\nabout. The two brothers wanted to catch two, and roast them. But the\r\ndwarf said, \xe2\x80\x98Let the poor things enjoy themselves, you shall not kill\r\nthem.\xe2\x80\x99 Next they came to a bees\xe2\x80\x99-nest in a hollow tree, and there was\r\nso much honey that it ran down the trunk; and the two brothers wanted to\r\nlight a fire under the tree and kill the bees, so as to get their honey.\r\nBut the dwarf held them back, and said, \xe2\x80\x98Let the pretty insects enjoy\r\nthemselves, I cannot let you burn them.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAt length the three brothers came to a castle: and as they passed by the\r\nstables they saw fine horses standing there, but all were of marble, and\r\nno man was to be seen. Then they went through all the rooms, till they\r\ncame to a door on which were three locks: but in the middle of the door\r\nwas a wicket, so that they could look into the next room. There they saw\r\na little grey old man sitting at a table; and they called to him once or\r\ntwice, but he did not hear: however, they called a third time, and then\r\nhe rose and came out to them.\r\n\r\nHe said nothing, but took hold of them and led them to a beautiful\r\ntable covered with all sorts of good things: and when they had eaten and\r\ndrunk, he showed each of them to a bed-chamber.\r\n\r\nThe next morning he came to the eldest and took him to a marble table,\r\nwhere there were three tablets, containing an account of the means by\r\nwhich the castle might be disenchanted. The first tablet said: \xe2\x80\x98In the\r\nwood, under the moss, lie the thousand pearls belonging to the king\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndaughter; they must all be found: and if one be missing by set of sun,\r\nhe who seeks them will be turned into marble.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe eldest brother set out, and sought for the pearls the whole day:\r\nbut the evening came, and he had not found the first hundred: so he was\r\nturned into stone as the tablet had foretold.\r\n\r\nThe next day the second brother undertook the task; but he succeeded no\r\nbetter than the first; for he could only find the second hundred of the\r\npearls; and therefore he too was turned into stone.\r\n\r\nAt last came the little dwarf\xe2\x80\x99s turn; and he looked in the moss; but it\r\nwas so hard to find the pearls, and the job was so tiresome!--so he sat\r\ndown upon a stone and cried. And as he sat there, the king of the ants\r\n(whose life he had saved) came to help him, with five thousand ants; and\r\nit was not long before they had found all the pearls and laid them in a\r\nheap.\r\n\r\nThe second tablet said: \xe2\x80\x98The key of the princess\xe2\x80\x99s bed-chamber must be\r\nfished up out of the lake.\xe2\x80\x99 And as the dwarf came to the brink of it,\r\nhe saw the two ducks whose lives he had saved swimming about; and they\r\ndived down and soon brought in the key from the bottom.\r\n\r\nThe third task was the hardest. It was to choose out the youngest and\r\nthe best of the king\xe2\x80\x99s three daughters. Now they were all beautiful, and\r\nall exactly alike: but he was told that the eldest had eaten a piece of\r\nsugar, the next some sweet syrup, and the youngest a spoonful of honey;\r\nso he was to guess which it was that had eaten the honey.\r\n\r\nThen came the queen of the bees, who had been saved by the little dwarf\r\nfrom the fire, and she tried the lips of all three; but at last she sat\r\nupon the lips of the one that had eaten the honey: and so the dwarf knew\r\nwhich was the youngest. Thus the spell was broken, and all who had been\r\nturned into stones awoke, and took their proper forms. And the dwarf\r\nmarried the youngest and the best of the princesses, and was king after\r\nher father\xe2\x80\x99s death; but his two brothers married the other two sisters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ELVES AND THE SHOEMAKER\r\n\r\nThere was once a shoemaker, who worked very hard and was very honest:\r\nbut still he could not earn enough to live upon; and at last all he\r\nhad in the world was gone, save just leather enough to make one pair of\r\nshoes.\r\n\r\nThen he cut his leather out, all ready to make up the next day, meaning\r\nto rise early in the morning to his work. His conscience was clear and\r\nhis heart light amidst all his troubles; so he went peaceably to bed,\r\nleft all his cares to Heaven, and soon fell asleep. In the morning after\r\nhe had said his prayers, he sat himself down to his work; when, to his\r\ngreat wonder, there stood the shoes all ready made, upon the table. The\r\ngood man knew not what to say or think at such an odd thing happening.\r\nHe looked at the workmanship; there was not one false stitch in the\r\nwhole job; all was so neat and true, that it was quite a masterpiece.\r\n\r\nThe same day a customer came in, and the shoes suited him so well that\r\nhe willingly paid a price higher than usual for them; and the poor\r\nshoemaker, with the money, bought leather enough to make two pairs more.\r\nIn the evening he cut out the work, and went to bed early, that he might\r\nget up and begin betimes next day; but he was saved all the trouble, for\r\nwhen he got up in the morning the work was done ready to his hand. Soon\r\nin came buyers, who paid him handsomely for his goods, so that he bought\r\nleather enough for four pair more. He cut out the work again overnight\r\nand found it done in the morning, as before; and so it went on for some\r\ntime: what was got ready in the evening was always done by daybreak, and\r\nthe good man soon became thriving and well off again.\r\n\r\nOne evening, about Christmas-time, as he and his wife were sitting over\r\nthe fire chatting together, he said to her, \xe2\x80\x98I should like to sit up and\r\nwatch tonight, that we may see who it is that comes and does my work for\r\nme.\xe2\x80\x99 The wife liked the thought; so they left a light burning, and hid\r\nthemselves in a corner of the room, behind a curtain that was hung up\r\nthere, and watched what would happen.\r\n\r\nAs soon as it was midnight, there came in two little naked dwarfs; and\r\nthey sat themselves upon the shoemaker\xe2\x80\x99s bench, took up all the work\r\nthat was cut out, and began to ply with their little fingers, stitching\r\nand rapping and tapping away at such a rate, that the shoemaker was all\r\nwonder, and could not take his eyes off them. And on they went, till the\r\njob was quite done, and the shoes stood ready for use upon the table.\r\nThis was long before daybreak; and then they bustled away as quick as\r\nlightning.\r\n\r\nThe next day the wife said to the shoemaker. \xe2\x80\x98These little wights have\r\nmade us rich, and we ought to be thankful to them, and do them a good\r\nturn if we can. I am quite sorry to see them run about as they do; and\r\nindeed it is not very decent, for they have nothing upon their backs to\r\nkeep off the cold. I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you what, I will make each of them a shirt,\r\nand a coat and waistcoat, and a pair of pantaloons into the bargain; and\r\ndo you make each of them a little pair of shoes.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe thought pleased the good cobbler very much; and one evening, when\r\nall the things were ready, they laid them on the table, instead of the\r\nwork that they used to cut out, and then went and hid themselves, to\r\nwatch what the little elves would do.\r\n\r\nAbout midnight in they came, dancing and skipping, hopped round the\r\nroom, and then went to sit down to their work as usual; but when they\r\nsaw the clothes lying for them, they laughed and chuckled, and seemed\r\nmightily delighted.\r\n\r\nThen they dressed themselves in the twinkling of an eye, and danced and\r\ncapered and sprang about, as merry as could be; till at last they danced\r\nout at the door, and away over the green.\r\n\r\nThe good couple saw them no more; but everything went well with them\r\nfrom that time forward, as long as they lived.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE JUNIPER-TREE\r\n\r\nLong, long ago, some two thousand years or so, there lived a rich\r\nman with a good and beautiful wife. They loved each other dearly, but\r\nsorrowed much that they had no children. So greatly did they desire\r\nto have one, that the wife prayed for it day and night, but still they\r\nremained childless.\r\n\r\nIn front of the house there was a court, in which grew a juniper-tree.\r\nOne winter\xe2\x80\x99s day the wife stood under the tree to peel some apples, and\r\nas she was peeling them, she cut her finger, and the blood fell on the\r\nsnow. \xe2\x80\x98Ah,\xe2\x80\x99 sighed the woman heavily, \xe2\x80\x98if I had but a child, as red as\r\nblood and as white as snow,\xe2\x80\x99 and as she spoke the words, her heart grew\r\nlight within her, and it seemed to her that her wish was granted, and\r\nshe returned to the house feeling glad and comforted. A month passed,\r\nand the snow had all disappeared; then another month went by, and all\r\nthe earth was green. So the months followed one another, and first the\r\ntrees budded in the woods, and soon the green branches grew thickly\r\nintertwined, and then the blossoms began to fall. Once again the wife\r\nstood under the juniper-tree, and it was so full of sweet scent that her\r\nheart leaped for joy, and she was so overcome with her happiness, that\r\nshe fell on her knees. Presently the fruit became round and firm, and\r\nshe was glad and at peace; but when they were fully ripe she picked the\r\nberries and ate eagerly of them, and then she grew sad and ill. A little\r\nwhile later she called her husband, and said to him, weeping. \xe2\x80\x98If I\r\ndie, bury me under the juniper-tree.\xe2\x80\x99 Then she felt comforted and happy\r\nagain, and before another month had passed she had a little child, and\r\nwhen she saw that it was as white as snow and as red as blood, her joy\r\nwas so great that she died.\r\n\r\nHer husband buried her under the juniper-tree, and wept bitterly for\r\nher. By degrees, however, his sorrow grew less, and although at times he\r\nstill grieved over his loss, he was able to go about as usual, and later\r\non he married again.\r\n\r\nHe now had a little daughter born to him; the child of his first wife\r\nwas a boy, who was as red as blood and as white as snow. The mother\r\nloved her daughter very much, and when she looked at her and then looked\r\nat the boy, it pierced her heart to think that he would always stand in\r\nthe way of her own child, and she was continually thinking how she could\r\nget the whole of the property for her. This evil thought took possession\r\nof her more and more, and made her behave very unkindly to the boy. She\r\ndrove him from place to place with cuffings and buffetings, so that the\r\npoor child went about in fear, and had no peace from the time he left\r\nschool to the time he went back.\r\n\r\nOne day the little daughter came running to her mother in the\r\nstore-room, and said, \xe2\x80\x98Mother, give me an apple.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Yes, my child,\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nthe wife, and she gave her a beautiful apple out of the chest; the chest\r\nhad a very heavy lid and a large iron lock.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Mother,\xe2\x80\x99 said the little daughter again, \xe2\x80\x98may not brother have one\r\ntoo?\xe2\x80\x99 The mother was angry at this, but she answered, \xe2\x80\x98Yes, when he\r\ncomes out of school.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nJust then she looked out of the window and saw him coming, and it seemed\r\nas if an evil spirit entered into her, for she snatched the apple out\r\nof her little daughter\xe2\x80\x99s hand, and said, \xe2\x80\x98You shall not have one before\r\nyour brother.\xe2\x80\x99 She threw the apple into the chest and shut it to. The\r\nlittle boy now came in, and the evil spirit in the wife made her say\r\nkindly to him, \xe2\x80\x98My son, will you have an apple?\xe2\x80\x99 but she gave him a\r\nwicked look. \xe2\x80\x98Mother,\xe2\x80\x99 said the boy, \xe2\x80\x98how dreadful you look! Yes, give\r\nme an apple.\xe2\x80\x99 The thought came to her that she would kill him. \xe2\x80\x98Come\r\nwith me,\xe2\x80\x99 she said, and she lifted up the lid of the chest; \xe2\x80\x98take one\r\nout for yourself.\xe2\x80\x99 And as he bent over to do so, the evil spirit urged\r\nher, and crash! down went the lid, and off went the little boy\xe2\x80\x99s head.\r\nThen she was overwhelmed with fear at the thought of what she had done.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If only I can prevent anyone knowing that I did it,\xe2\x80\x99 she thought. So\r\nshe went upstairs to her room, and took a white handkerchief out of\r\nher top drawer; then she set the boy\xe2\x80\x99s head again on his shoulders, and\r\nbound it with the handkerchief so that nothing could be seen, and placed\r\nhim on a chair by the door with an apple in his hand.\r\n\r\nSoon after this, little Marleen came up to her mother who was stirring\r\na pot of boiling water over the fire, and said, \xe2\x80\x98Mother, brother is\r\nsitting by the door with an apple in his hand, and he looks so pale;\r\nand when I asked him to give me the apple, he did not answer, and that\r\nfrightened me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Go to him again,\xe2\x80\x99 said her mother, \xe2\x80\x98and if he does not answer, give him\r\na box on the ear.\xe2\x80\x99 So little Marleen went, and said, \xe2\x80\x98Brother, give me\r\nthat apple,\xe2\x80\x99 but he did not say a word; then she gave him a box on the\r\near, and his head rolled off. She was so terrified at this, that she ran\r\ncrying and screaming to her mother. \xe2\x80\x98Oh!\xe2\x80\x99 she said, \xe2\x80\x98I have knocked off\r\nbrother\xe2\x80\x99s head,\xe2\x80\x99 and then she wept and wept, and nothing would stop her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What have you done!\xe2\x80\x99 said her mother, \xe2\x80\x98but no one must know about it,\r\nso you must keep silence; what is done can\xe2\x80\x99t be undone; we will make\r\nhim into puddings.\xe2\x80\x99 And she took the little boy and cut him up, made him\r\ninto puddings, and put him in the pot. But Marleen stood looking on,\r\nand wept and wept, and her tears fell into the pot, so that there was no\r\nneed of salt.\r\n\r\nPresently the father came home and sat down to his dinner; he asked,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Where is my son?\xe2\x80\x99 The mother said nothing, but gave him a large dish of\r\nblack pudding, and Marleen still wept without ceasing.\r\n\r\nThe father again asked, \xe2\x80\x98Where is my son?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh,\xe2\x80\x99 answered the wife, \xe2\x80\x98he is gone into the country to his mother\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngreat uncle; he is going to stay there some time.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What has he gone there for, and he never even said goodbye to me!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well, he likes being there, and he told me he should be away quite six\r\nweeks; he is well looked after there.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I feel very unhappy about it,\xe2\x80\x99 said the husband, \xe2\x80\x98in case it should not\r\nbe all right, and he ought to have said goodbye to me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWith this he went on with his dinner, and said, \xe2\x80\x98Little Marleen, why do\r\nyou weep? Brother will soon be back.\xe2\x80\x99 Then he asked his wife for more\r\npudding, and as he ate, he threw the bones under the table.\r\n\r\nLittle Marleen went upstairs and took her best silk handkerchief out of\r\nher bottom drawer, and in it she wrapped all the bones from under the\r\ntable and carried them outside, and all the time she did nothing but\r\nweep. Then she laid them in the green grass under the juniper-tree, and\r\nshe had no sooner done so, then all her sadness seemed to leave her,\r\nand she wept no more. And now the juniper-tree began to move, and the\r\nbranches waved backwards and forwards, first away from one another, and\r\nthen together again, as it might be someone clapping their hands for\r\njoy. After this a mist came round the tree, and in the midst of it there\r\nwas a burning as of fire, and out of the fire there flew a beautiful\r\nbird, that rose high into the air, singing magnificently, and when it\r\ncould no more be seen, the juniper-tree stood there as before, and the\r\nsilk handkerchief and the bones were gone.\r\n\r\nLittle Marleen now felt as lighthearted and happy as if her brother were\r\nstill alive, and she went back to the house and sat down cheerfully to\r\nthe table and ate.\r\n\r\nThe bird flew away and alighted on the house of a goldsmith and began to\r\nsing:\r\n\r\n \xe2\x80\x98My mother killed her little son;\r\n  My father grieved when I was gone;\r\n  My sister loved me best of all;\r\n  She laid her kerchief over me,\r\n  And took my bones that they might lie\r\n  Underneath the juniper-tree\r\n  Kywitt, Kywitt, what a beautiful bird am I!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe goldsmith was in his workshop making a gold chain, when he heard the\r\nsong of the bird on his roof. He thought it so beautiful that he got\r\nup and ran out, and as he crossed the threshold he lost one of his\r\nslippers. But he ran on into the middle of the street, with a slipper on\r\none foot and a sock on the other; he still had on his apron, and still\r\nheld the gold chain and the pincers in his hands, and so he stood gazing\r\nup at the bird, while the sun came shining brightly down on the street.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Bird,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, \xe2\x80\x98how beautifully you sing! Sing me that song again.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nay,\xe2\x80\x99 said the bird, \xe2\x80\x98I do not sing twice for nothing. Give that gold\r\nchain, and I will sing it you again.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Here is the chain, take it,\xe2\x80\x99 said the goldsmith. \xe2\x80\x98Only sing me that\r\nagain.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe bird flew down and took the gold chain in his right claw, and then\r\nhe alighted again in front of the goldsmith and sang:\r\n\r\n \xe2\x80\x98My mother killed her little son;\r\n  My father grieved when I was gone;\r\n  My sister loved me best of all;\r\n  She laid her kerchief over me,\r\n  And took my bones that they might lie\r\n  Underneath the juniper-tree\r\n  Kywitt, Kywitt, what a beautiful bird am I!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThen he flew away, and settled on the roof of a shoemaker\xe2\x80\x99s house and\r\nsang:\r\n\r\n \xe2\x80\x98My mother killed her little son;\r\n  My father grieved when I was gone;\r\n  My sister loved me best of all;\r\n  She laid her kerchief over me,\r\n  And took my bones that they might lie\r\n  Underneath the juniper-tree\r\n  Kywitt, Kywitt, what a beautiful bird am I!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe shoemaker heard him, and he jumped up and ran out in his\r\nshirt-sleeves, and stood looking up at the bird on the roof with his\r\nhand over his eyes to keep himself from being blinded by the sun.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Bird,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, \xe2\x80\x98how beautifully you sing!\xe2\x80\x99 Then he called through the\r\ndoor to his wife: \xe2\x80\x98Wife, come out; here is a bird, come and look at it\r\nand hear how beautifully it sings.\xe2\x80\x99 Then he called his daughter and the\r\nchildren, then the apprentices, girls and boys, and they all ran up the\r\nstreet to look at the bird, and saw how splendid it was with its red\r\nand green feathers, and its neck like burnished gold, and eyes like two\r\nbright stars in its head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Bird,\xe2\x80\x99 said the shoemaker, \xe2\x80\x98sing me that song again.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nay,\xe2\x80\x99 answered the bird, \xe2\x80\x98I do not sing twice for nothing; you must\r\ngive me something.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Wife,\xe2\x80\x99 said the man, \xe2\x80\x98go into the garret; on the upper shelf you will\r\nsee a pair of red shoes; bring them to me.\xe2\x80\x99 The wife went in and fetched\r\nthe shoes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There, bird,\xe2\x80\x99 said the shoemaker, \xe2\x80\x98now sing me that song again.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe bird flew down and took the red shoes in his left claw, and then he\r\nwent back to the roof and sang:\r\n\r\n \xe2\x80\x98My mother killed her little son;\r\n  My father grieved when I was gone;\r\n  My sister loved me best of all;\r\n  She laid her kerchief over me,\r\n  And took my bones that they might lie\r\n  Underneath the juniper-tree\r\n  Kywitt, Kywitt, what a beautiful bird am I!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWhen he had finished, he flew away. He had the chain in his right claw\r\nand the shoes in his left, and he flew right away to a mill, and the\r\nmill went \xe2\x80\x98Click clack, click clack, click clack.\xe2\x80\x99 Inside the mill were\r\ntwenty of the miller\xe2\x80\x99s men hewing a stone, and as they went \xe2\x80\x98Hick hack,\r\nhick hack, hick hack,\xe2\x80\x99 the mill went \xe2\x80\x98Click clack, click clack, click\r\nclack.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe bird settled on a lime-tree in front of the mill and sang:\r\n\r\n \xe2\x80\x98My mother killed her little son;\r\n\r\nthen one of the men left off,\r\n\r\n  My father grieved when I was gone;\r\n\r\ntwo more men left off and listened,\r\n\r\n  My sister loved me best of all;\r\n\r\nthen four more left off,\r\n\r\n  She laid her kerchief over me,\r\n  And took my bones that they might lie\r\n\r\nnow there were only eight at work,\r\n\r\n  Underneath\r\n\r\nAnd now only five,\r\n\r\n  the juniper-tree.\r\n\r\nAnd now only one,\r\n\r\n  Kywitt, Kywitt, what a beautiful bird am I!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nthen he looked up and the last one had left off work.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Bird,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, \xe2\x80\x98what a beautiful song that is you sing! Let me hear it\r\ntoo; sing it again.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Nay,\xe2\x80\x99 answered the bird, \xe2\x80\x98I do not sing twice for nothing; give me that\r\nmillstone, and I will sing it again.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If it belonged to me alone,\xe2\x80\x99 said the man, \xe2\x80\x98you should have it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, yes,\xe2\x80\x99 said the others: \xe2\x80\x98if he will sing again, he can have it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe bird came down, and all the twenty millers set to and lifted up the\r\nstone with a beam; then the bird put his head through the hole and took\r\nthe stone round his neck like a collar, and flew back with it to the\r\ntree and sang--\r\n\r\n \xe2\x80\x98My mother killed her little son;\r\n  My father grieved when I was gone;\r\n  My sister loved me best of all;\r\n  She laid her kerchief over me,\r\n  And took my bones that they might lie\r\n  Underneath the juniper-tree\r\n  Kywitt, Kywitt, what a beautiful bird am I!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAnd when he had finished his song, he spread his wings, and with the\r\nchain in his right claw, the shoes in his left, and the millstone round\r\nhis neck, he flew right away to his father\xe2\x80\x99s house.\r\n\r\nThe father, the mother, and little Marleen were having their dinner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98How lighthearted I feel,\xe2\x80\x99 said the father, \xe2\x80\x98so pleased and cheerful.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98And I,\xe2\x80\x99 said the mother, \xe2\x80\x98I feel so uneasy, as if a heavy thunderstorm\r\nwere coming.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBut little Marleen sat and wept and wept.\r\n\r\nThen the bird came flying towards the house and settled on the roof.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I do feel so happy,\xe2\x80\x99 said the father, \xe2\x80\x98and how beautifully the sun\r\nshines; I feel just as if I were going to see an old friend again.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah!\xe2\x80\x99 said the wife, \xe2\x80\x98and I am so full of distress and uneasiness that\r\nmy teeth chatter, and I feel as if there were a fire in my veins,\xe2\x80\x99 and\r\nshe tore open her dress; and all the while little Marleen sat in the\r\ncorner and wept, and the plate on her knees was wet with her tears.\r\n\r\nThe bird now flew to the juniper-tree and began singing:\r\n\r\n \xe2\x80\x98My mother killed her little son;\r\n\r\nthe mother shut her eyes and her ears, that she might see and hear\r\nnothing, but there was a roaring sound in her ears like that of a\r\nviolent storm, and in her eyes a burning and flashing like lightning:\r\n\r\n  My father grieved when I was gone;\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Look, mother,\xe2\x80\x99 said the man, \xe2\x80\x98at the beautiful bird that is singing so\r\nmagnificently; and how warm and bright the sun is, and what a delicious\r\nscent of spice in the air!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n  My sister loved me best of all;\r\n\r\nthen little Marleen laid her head down on her knees and sobbed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I must go outside and see the bird nearer,\xe2\x80\x99 said the man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah, do not go!\xe2\x80\x99 cried the wife. \xe2\x80\x98I feel as if the whole house were in\r\nflames!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBut the man went out and looked at the bird.\r\n\r\n She laid her kerchief over me,\r\n And took my bones that they might lie\r\n Underneath the juniper-tree\r\n Kywitt, Kywitt, what a beautiful bird am I!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWith that the bird let fall the gold chain, and it fell just round the\r\nman\xe2\x80\x99s neck, so that it fitted him exactly.\r\n\r\nHe went inside, and said, \xe2\x80\x98See, what a splendid bird that is; he has\r\ngiven me this beautiful gold chain, and looks so beautiful himself.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBut the wife was in such fear and trouble, that she fell on the floor,\r\nand her cap fell from her head.\r\n\r\nThen the bird began again:\r\n\r\n \xe2\x80\x98My mother killed her little son;\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah me!\xe2\x80\x99 cried the wife, \xe2\x80\x98if I were but a thousand feet beneath the\r\nearth, that I might not hear that song.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n  My father grieved when I was gone;\r\n\r\nthen the woman fell down again as if dead.\r\n\r\n  My sister loved me best of all;\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well,\xe2\x80\x99 said little Marleen, \xe2\x80\x98I will go out too and see if the bird will\r\ngive me anything.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSo she went out.\r\n\r\n  She laid her kerchief over me,\r\n  And took my bones that they might lie\r\n\r\nand he threw down the shoes to her,\r\n\r\n  Underneath the juniper-tree\r\n  Kywitt, Kywitt, what a beautiful bird am I!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAnd she now felt quite happy and lighthearted; she put on the shoes and\r\ndanced and jumped about in them. \xe2\x80\x98I was so miserable,\xe2\x80\x99 she said, \xe2\x80\x98when I\r\ncame out, but that has all passed away; that is indeed a splendid bird,\r\nand he has given me a pair of red shoes.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe wife sprang up, with her hair standing out from her head like flames\r\nof fire. \xe2\x80\x98Then I will go out too,\xe2\x80\x99 she said, \xe2\x80\x98and see if it will lighten\r\nmy misery, for I feel as if the world were coming to an end.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBut as she crossed the threshold, crash! the bird threw the millstone\r\ndown on her head, and she was crushed to death.\r\n\r\nThe father and little Marleen heard the sound and ran out, but they only\r\nsaw mist and flame and fire rising from the spot, and when these had\r\npassed, there stood the little brother, and he took the father and\r\nlittle Marleen by the hand; then they all three rejoiced, and went\r\ninside together and sat down to their dinners and ate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TURNIP\r\n\r\nThere were two brothers who were both soldiers; the one was rich and\r\nthe other poor. The poor man thought he would try to better himself; so,\r\npulling off his red coat, he became a gardener, and dug his ground well,\r\nand sowed turnips.\r\n\r\nWhen the seed came up, there was one plant bigger than all the rest; and\r\nit kept getting larger and larger, and seemed as if it would never cease\r\ngrowing; so that it might have been called the prince of turnips for\r\nthere never was such a one seen before, and never will again. At last it\r\nwas so big that it filled a cart, and two oxen could hardly draw it; and\r\nthe gardener knew not what in the world to do with it, nor whether it\r\nwould be a blessing or a curse to him. One day he said to himself, \xe2\x80\x98What\r\nshall I do with it? if I sell it, it will bring no more than another;\r\nand for eating, the little turnips are better than this; the best thing\r\nperhaps is to carry it and give it to the king as a mark of respect.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThen he yoked his oxen, and drew the turnip to the court, and gave it\r\nto the king. \xe2\x80\x98What a wonderful thing!\xe2\x80\x99 said the king; \xe2\x80\x98I have seen many\r\nstrange things, but such a monster as this I never saw. Where did you\r\nget the seed? or is it only your good luck? If so, you are a true child\r\nof fortune.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Ah, no!\xe2\x80\x99 answered the gardener, \xe2\x80\x98I am no child of fortune;\r\nI am a poor soldier, who never could get enough to live upon; so I\r\nlaid aside my red coat, and set to work, tilling the ground. I have a\r\nbrother, who is rich, and your majesty knows him well, and all the world\r\nknows him; but because I am poor, everybody forgets me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe king then took pity on him, and said, \xe2\x80\x98You shall be poor no\r\nlonger. I will give you so much that you shall be even richer than your\r\nbrother.\xe2\x80\x99 Then he gave him gold and lands and flocks, and made him so\r\nrich that his brother\xe2\x80\x99s fortune could not at all be compared with his.\r\n\r\nWhen the brother heard of all this, and how a turnip had made the\r\ngardener so rich, he envied him sorely, and bethought himself how he\r\ncould contrive to get the same good fortune for himself. However, he\r\ndetermined to manage more cleverly than his brother, and got together a\r\nrich present of gold and fine horses for the king; and thought he must\r\nhave a much larger gift in return; for if his brother had received so\r\nmuch for only a turnip, what must his present be worth?\r\n\r\nThe king took the gift very graciously, and said he knew not what to\r\ngive in return more valuable and wonderful than the great turnip; so\r\nthe soldier was forced to put it into a cart, and drag it home with him.\r\nWhen he reached home, he knew not upon whom to vent his rage and spite;\r\nand at length wicked thoughts came into his head, and he resolved to\r\nkill his brother.\r\n\r\nSo he hired some villains to murder him; and having shown them where to\r\nlie in ambush, he went to his brother, and said, \xe2\x80\x98Dear brother, I have\r\nfound a hidden treasure; let us go and dig it up, and share it between\r\nus.\xe2\x80\x99 The other had no suspicions of his roguery: so they went out\r\ntogether, and as they were travelling along, the murderers rushed out\r\nupon him, bound him, and were going to hang him on a tree.\r\n\r\nBut whilst they were getting all ready, they heard the trampling of a\r\nhorse at a distance, which so frightened them that they pushed their\r\nprisoner neck and shoulders together into a sack, and swung him up by a\r\ncord to the tree, where they left him dangling, and ran away. Meantime\r\nhe worked and worked away, till he made a hole large enough to put out\r\nhis head.\r\n\r\nWhen the horseman came up, he proved to be a student, a merry fellow,\r\nwho was journeying along on his nag, and singing as he went. As soon as\r\nthe man in the sack saw him passing under the tree, he cried out, \xe2\x80\x98Good\r\nmorning! good morning to thee, my friend!\xe2\x80\x99 The student looked about\r\neverywhere; and seeing no one, and not knowing where the voice came\r\nfrom, cried out, \xe2\x80\x98Who calls me?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThen the man in the tree answered, \xe2\x80\x98Lift up thine eyes, for behold here\r\nI sit in the sack of wisdom; here have I, in a short time, learned great\r\nand wondrous things. Compared to this seat, all the learning of the\r\nschools is as empty air. A little longer, and I shall know all that man\r\ncan know, and shall come forth wiser than the wisest of mankind. Here\r\nI discern the signs and motions of the heavens and the stars; the laws\r\nthat control the winds; the number of the sands on the seashore; the\r\nhealing of the sick; the virtues of all simples, of birds, and of\r\nprecious stones. Wert thou but once here, my friend, though wouldst feel\r\nand own the power of knowledge.\r\n\r\nThe student listened to all this and wondered much; at last he said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Blessed be the day and hour when I found you; cannot you contrive to\r\nlet me into the sack for a little while?\xe2\x80\x99 Then the other answered, as if\r\nvery unwillingly, \xe2\x80\x98A little space I may allow thee to sit here, if thou\r\nwilt reward me well and entreat me kindly; but thou must tarry yet an\r\nhour below, till I have learnt some little matters that are yet unknown\r\nto me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSo the student sat himself down and waited a while; but the time hung\r\nheavy upon him, and he begged earnestly that he might ascend forthwith,\r\nfor his thirst for knowledge was great. Then the other pretended to give\r\nway, and said, \xe2\x80\x98Thou must let the sack of wisdom descend, by untying\r\nyonder cord, and then thou shalt enter.\xe2\x80\x99 So the student let him down,\r\nopened the sack, and set him free. \xe2\x80\x98Now then,\xe2\x80\x99 cried he, \xe2\x80\x98let me ascend\r\nquickly.\xe2\x80\x99 As he began to put himself into the sack heels first, \xe2\x80\x98Wait a\r\nwhile,\xe2\x80\x99 said the gardener, \xe2\x80\x98that is not the way.\xe2\x80\x99 Then he pushed him\r\nin head first, tied up the sack, and soon swung up the searcher after\r\nwisdom dangling in the air. \xe2\x80\x98How is it with thee, friend?\xe2\x80\x99 said he,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98dost thou not feel that wisdom comes unto thee? Rest there in peace,\r\ntill thou art a wiser man than thou wert.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSo saying, he trotted off on the student\xe2\x80\x99s nag, and left the poor fellow\r\nto gather wisdom till somebody should come and let him down.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCLEVER HANS\r\n\r\nThe mother of Hans said: \xe2\x80\x98Whither away, Hans?\xe2\x80\x99 Hans answered: \xe2\x80\x98To\r\nGretel.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Behave well, Hans.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Oh, I\xe2\x80\x99ll behave well.

Where have you been?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98With Gretel.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98What did you take\r\nher?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98I took her nothing.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98What did Gretel give you?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98She gave me\r\nnothing, she came with me.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Where have you left Gretel?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98I led her by\r\nthe rope, tied her to the rack, and scattered some grass for her.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98That\r\nwas ill done, Hans, you should have cast friendly eyes on her.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Never\r\nmind, will do better.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHans went into the stable, cut out all the calves\xe2\x80\x99 and sheep\xe2\x80\x99s eyes,\r\nand threw them in Gretel\xe2\x80\x99s face. Then Gretel became angry, tore herself\r\nloose and ran away, and was no longer the bride of Hans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE THREE LANGUAGES\r\n\r\nAn aged count once lived in Switzerland, who had an only son, but he\r\nwas stupid, and could learn nothing. Then said the father: \xe2\x80\x98Hark you,\r\nmy son, try as I will I can get nothing into your head. You must go from\r\nhence, I will give you into the care of a celebrated master, who shall\r\nsee what he can do with you.\xe2\x80\x99 The youth was sent into a strange town,\r\nand remained a whole year with the master. At the end of this time,\r\nhe came home again, and his father asked: \xe2\x80\x98Now, my son, what have you\r\nlearnt?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Father, I have learnt what the dogs say when they bark.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Lord\r\nhave mercy on us!\xe2\x80\x99 cried the father; \xe2\x80\x98is that all you have learnt? I\r\nwill send you into another town, to another master.\xe2\x80\x99 The youth was taken\r\nthither, and stayed a year with this master likewise. When he came back\r\nthe father again asked: \xe2\x80\x98My son, what have you learnt?\xe2\x80\x99 He answered:\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Father, I have learnt what the birds say.\xe2\x80\x99 Then the father fell into a\r\nrage and said: \xe2\x80\x98Oh, you lost man, you have spent the precious time and\r\nlearnt nothing; are you not ashamed to appear before my eyes? I will\r\nsend you to a third master, but if you learn nothing this time also, I\r\nwill no longer be your father.\xe2\x80\x99 The youth remained a whole year with the\r\nthird master also, and when he came home again, and his father inquired:\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My son, what have you learnt?\xe2\x80\x99 he answered: \xe2\x80\x98Dear father, I have this\r\nyear learnt what the frogs croak.\xe2\x80\x99 Then the father fell into the most\r\nfurious anger, sprang up, called his people thither, and said: \xe2\x80\x98This man\r\nis no longer my son, I drive him forth, and command you to take him\r\nout into the forest, and kill him.\xe2\x80\x99 They took him forth, but when they\r\nshould have killed him, they could not do it for pity, and let him go,\r\nand they cut the eyes and tongue out of a deer that they might carry\r\nthem to the old man as a token.\r\n\r\nThe youth wandered on, and after some time came to a fortress where he\r\nbegged for a night\xe2\x80\x99s lodging. \xe2\x80\x98Yes,\xe2\x80\x99 said the lord of the castle, \xe2\x80\x98if\r\nyou will pass the night down there in the old tower, go thither; but I\r\nwarn you, it is at the peril of your life, for it is full of wild dogs,\r\nwhich bark and howl without stopping, and at certain hours a man has to\r\nbe given to them, whom they at once devour.\xe2\x80\x99 The whole district was in\r\nsorrow and dismay because of them, and yet no one could do anything to\r\nstop this. The youth, however, was without fear, and said: \xe2\x80\x98Just let me\r\ngo down to the barking dogs, and give me something that I can throw to\r\nthem; they will do nothing to harm me.\xe2\x80\x99 As he himself would have it so,\r\nthey gave him some food for the wild animals, and led him down to the\r\ntower. When he went inside, the dogs did not bark at him, but wagged\r\ntheir tails quite amicably around him, ate what he set before them, and\r\ndid not hurt one hair of his head. Next morning, to the astonishment of\r\neveryone, he came out again safe and unharmed, and said to the lord of\r\nthe castle: \xe2\x80\x98The dogs have revealed to me, in their own language, why\r\nthey dwell there, and bring evil on the land. They are bewitched, and\r\nare obliged to watch over a great treasure which is below in the tower,\r\nand they can have no rest until it is taken away, and I have likewise\r\nlearnt, from their discourse, how that is to be done.\xe2\x80\x99 Then all who\r\nheard this rejoiced, and the lord of the castle said he would adopt him\r\nas a son if he accomplished it successfully. He went down again, and\r\nas he knew what he had to do, he did it thoroughly, and brought a chest\r\nfull of gold out with him. The howling of the wild dogs was henceforth\r\nheard no more; they had disappeared, and the country was freed from the\r\ntrouble.\r\n\r\nAfter some time he took it in his head that he would travel to Rome. On\r\nthe way he passed by a marsh, in which a number of frogs were sitting\r\ncroaking. He listened to them, and when he became aware of what they\r\nwere saying, he grew very thoughtful and sad. At last he arrived in\r\nRome, where the Pope had just died, and there was great doubt among\r\nthe cardinals as to whom they should appoint as his successor. They at\r\nlength agreed that the person should be chosen as pope who should be\r\ndistinguished by some divine and miraculous token. And just as that was\r\ndecided on, the young count entered into the church, and suddenly two\r\nsnow-white doves flew on his shoulders and remained sitting there. The\r\necclesiastics recognized therein the token from above, and asked him on\r\nthe spot if he would be pope. He was undecided, and knew not if he were\r\nworthy of this, but the doves counselled him to do it, and at length he\r\nsaid yes. Then was he anointed and consecrated, and thus was fulfilled\r\nwhat he had heard from the frogs on his way, which had so affected him,\r\nthat he was to be his Holiness the Pope. Then he had to sing a mass, and\r\ndid not know one word of it, but the two doves sat continually on his\r\nshoulders, and said it all in his ear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FOX AND THE CAT\r\n\r\nIt happened that the cat met the fox in a forest, and as she thought to\r\nherself: \xe2\x80\x98He is clever and full of experience, and much esteemed in the\r\nworld,\xe2\x80\x99 she spoke to him in a friendly way. \xe2\x80\x98Good day, dear Mr Fox,\r\nhow are you? How is all with you? How are you getting on in these hard\r\ntimes?\xe2\x80\x99 The fox, full of all kinds of arrogance, looked at the cat from\r\nhead to foot, and for a long time did not know whether he would give\r\nany answer or not. At last he said: \xe2\x80\x98Oh, you wretched beard-cleaner, you\r\npiebald fool, you hungry mouse-hunter, what can you be thinking of? Have\r\nyou the cheek to ask how I am getting on? What have you learnt? How\r\nmany arts do you understand?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98I understand but one,\xe2\x80\x99 replied the\r\ncat, modestly. \xe2\x80\x98What art is that?\xe2\x80\x99 asked the fox. \xe2\x80\x98When the hounds are\r\nfollowing me, I can spring into a tree and save myself.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Is that all?\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsaid the fox. \xe2\x80\x98I am master of a hundred arts, and have into the bargain\r\na sackful of cunning. You make me sorry for you; come with me, I will\r\nteach you how people get away from the hounds.\xe2\x80\x99 Just then came a hunter\r\nwith four dogs. The cat sprang nimbly up a tree, and sat down at the top\r\nof it, where the branches and foliage quite concealed her. \xe2\x80\x98Open your\r\nsack, Mr Fox, open your sack,\xe2\x80\x99 cried the cat to him, but the dogs had\r\nalready seized him, and were holding him fast. \xe2\x80\x98Ah, Mr Fox,\xe2\x80\x99 cried the\r\ncat. \xe2\x80\x98You with your hundred arts are left in the lurch! Had you been\r\nable to climb like me, you would not have lost your life.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FOUR CLEVER BROTHERS\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Dear children,\xe2\x80\x99 said a poor man to his four sons, \xe2\x80\x98I have nothing to\r\ngive you; you must go out into the wide world and try your luck. Begin\r\nby learning some craft or another, and see how you can get on.\xe2\x80\x99 So the\r\nfour brothers took their walking-sticks in their hands, and their little\r\nbundles on their shoulders, and after bidding their father goodbye, went\r\nall out at the gate together. When they had got on some way they came\r\nto four crossways, each leading to a different country. Then the eldest\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x98Here we must part; but this day four years we will come back\r\nto this spot, and in the meantime each must try what he can do for\r\nhimself.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSo each brother went his way; and as the eldest was hastening on a man\r\nmet him, and asked him where he was going, and what he wanted. \xe2\x80\x98I am\r\ngoing to try my luck in the world, and should like to begin by learning\r\nsome art or trade,\xe2\x80\x99 answered he. \xe2\x80\x98Then,\xe2\x80\x99 said the man, \xe2\x80\x98go with me, and\r\nI will teach you to become the cunningest thief that ever was.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98No,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsaid the other, \xe2\x80\x98that is not an honest calling, and what can one look\r\nto earn by it in the end but the gallows?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Oh!\xe2\x80\x99 said the man, \xe2\x80\x98you need\r\nnot fear the gallows; for I will only teach you to steal what will be\r\nfair game: I meddle with nothing but what no one else can get or care\r\nanything about, and where no one can find you out.\xe2\x80\x99 So the young man\r\nagreed to follow his trade, and he soon showed himself so clever, that\r\nnothing could escape him that he had once set his mind upon.\r\n\r\nThe second brother also met a man, who, when he found out what he was\r\nsetting out upon, asked him what craft he meant to follow. \xe2\x80\x98I do not\r\nknow yet,\xe2\x80\x99 said he. \xe2\x80\x98Then come with me, and be a star-gazer. It is a\r\nnoble art, for nothing can be hidden from you, when once you understand\r\nthe stars.\xe2\x80\x99 The plan pleased him much, and he soon became such a skilful\r\nstar-gazer, that when he had served out his time, and wanted to leave\r\nhis master, he gave him a glass, and said, \xe2\x80\x98With this you can see all\r\nthat is passing in the sky and on earth, and nothing can be hidden from\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe third brother met a huntsman, who took him with him, and taught him\r\nso well all that belonged to hunting, that he became very clever in the\r\ncraft of the woods; and when he left his master he gave him a bow, and\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x98Whatever you shoot at with this bow you will be sure to hit.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe youngest brother likewise met a man who asked him what he wished to\r\ndo. \xe2\x80\x98Would not you like,\xe2\x80\x99 said he, \xe2\x80\x98to be a tailor?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Oh, no!\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nthe young man; \xe2\x80\x98sitting cross-legged from morning to night, working\r\nbackwards and forwards with a needle and goose, will never suit me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh!\xe2\x80\x99 answered the man, \xe2\x80\x98that is not my sort of tailoring; come with me,\r\nand you will learn quite another kind of craft from that.\xe2\x80\x99 Not knowing\r\nwhat better to do, he came into the plan, and learnt tailoring from the\r\nbeginning; and when he left his master, he gave him a needle, and said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You can sew anything with this, be it as soft as an egg or as hard as\r\nsteel; and the joint will be so fine that no seam will be seen.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAfter the space of four years, at the time agreed upon, the four\r\nbrothers met at the four cross-roads; and having welcomed each other,\r\nset off towards their father\xe2\x80\x99s home, where they told him all that had\r\nhappened to them, and how each had learned some craft.\r\n\r\nThen, one day, as they were sitting before the house under a very high\r\ntree, the father said, \xe2\x80\x98I should like to try what each of you can do in\r\nthis way.\xe2\x80\x99 So he looked up, and said to the second son, \xe2\x80\x98At the top of\r\nthis tree there is a chaffinch\xe2\x80\x99s nest; tell me how many eggs there are\r\nin it.\xe2\x80\x99 The star-gazer took his glass, looked up, and said, \xe2\x80\x98Five.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now,\xe2\x80\x99 said the father to the eldest son, \xe2\x80\x98take away the eggs without\r\nletting the bird that is sitting upon them and hatching them know\r\nanything of what you are doing.\xe2\x80\x99 So the cunning thief climbed up the\r\ntree, and brought away to his father the five eggs from under the bird;\r\nand it never saw or felt what he was doing, but kept sitting on at its\r\nease. Then the father took the eggs, and put one on each corner of the\r\ntable, and the fifth in the middle, and said to the huntsman, \xe2\x80\x98Cut all\r\nthe eggs in two pieces at one shot.\xe2\x80\x99 The huntsman took up his bow, and\r\nat one shot struck all the five eggs as his father wished.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now comes your turn,\xe2\x80\x99 said he to the young tailor; \xe2\x80\x98sew the eggs and\r\nthe young birds in them together again, so neatly that the shot shall\r\nhave done them no harm.\xe2\x80\x99 Then the tailor took his needle, and sewed the\r\neggs as he was told; and when he had done, the thief was sent to take\r\nthem back to the nest, and put them under the bird without its knowing\r\nit. Then she went on sitting, and hatched them: and in a few days they\r\ncrawled out, and had only a little red streak across their necks, where\r\nthe tailor had sewn them together.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well done, sons!\xe2\x80\x99 said the old man; \xe2\x80\x98you have made good use of your\r\ntime, and learnt something worth the knowing; but I am sure I do not\r\nknow which ought to have the prize. Oh, that a time might soon come for\r\nyou to turn your skill to some account!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nNot long after this there was a great bustle in the country; for the\r\nking\xe2\x80\x99s daughter had been carried off by a mighty dragon, and the king\r\nmourned over his loss day and night, and made it known that whoever\r\nbrought her back to him should have her for a wife. Then the four\r\nbrothers said to each other, \xe2\x80\x98Here is a chance for us; let us try\r\nwhat we can do.\xe2\x80\x99 And they agreed to see whether they could not set the\r\nprincess free. \xe2\x80\x98I will soon find out where she is, however,\xe2\x80\x99 said the\r\nstar-gazer, as he looked through his glass; and he soon cried out, \xe2\x80\x98I\r\nsee her afar off, sitting upon a rock in the sea, and I can spy the\r\ndragon close by, guarding her.\xe2\x80\x99 Then he went to the king, and asked for\r\na ship for himself and his brothers; and they sailed together over the\r\nsea, till they came to the right place. There they found the princess\r\nsitting, as the star-gazer had said, on the rock; and the dragon was\r\nlying asleep, with his head upon her lap. \xe2\x80\x98I dare not shoot at him,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsaid the huntsman, \xe2\x80\x98for I should kill the beautiful young lady also.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Then I will try my skill,\xe2\x80\x99 said the thief, and went and stole her away\r\nfrom under the dragon, so quietly and gently that the beast did not know\r\nit, but went on snoring.\r\n\r\nThen away they hastened with her full of joy in their boat towards the\r\nship; but soon came the dragon roaring behind them through the air; for\r\nhe awoke and missed the princess. But when he got over the boat, and\r\nwanted to pounce upon them and carry off the princess, the huntsman took\r\nup his bow and shot him straight through the heart so that he fell down\r\ndead. They were still not safe; for he was such a great beast that in\r\nhis fall he overset the boat, and they had to swim in the open sea\r\nupon a few planks. So the tailor took his needle, and with a few large\r\nstitches put some of the planks together; and he sat down upon these,\r\nand sailed about and gathered up all pieces of the boat; and then tacked\r\nthem together so quickly that the boat was soon ready, and they then\r\nreached the ship and got home safe.\r\n\r\nWhen they had brought home the princess to her father, there was great\r\nrejoicing; and he said to the four brothers, \xe2\x80\x98One of you shall marry\r\nher, but you must settle amongst yourselves which it is to be.\xe2\x80\x99 Then\r\nthere arose a quarrel between them; and the star-gazer said, \xe2\x80\x98If I had\r\nnot found the princess out, all your skill would have been of no use;\r\ntherefore she ought to be mine.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Your seeing her would have been of\r\nno use,\xe2\x80\x99 said the thief, \xe2\x80\x98if I had not taken her away from the dragon;\r\ntherefore she ought to be mine.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98No, she is mine,\xe2\x80\x99 said the huntsman;\r\n\xe2\x80\x98for if I had not killed the dragon, he would, after all, have torn you\r\nand the princess into pieces.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98And if I had not sewn the boat together\r\nagain,\xe2\x80\x99 said the tailor, \xe2\x80\x98you would all have been drowned, therefore she\r\nis mine.\xe2\x80\x99 Then the king put in a word, and said, \xe2\x80\x98Each of you is right;\r\nand as all cannot have the young lady, the best way is for neither of\r\nyou to have her: for the truth is, there is somebody she likes a great\r\ndeal better. But to make up for your loss, I will give each of you, as a\r\nreward for his skill, half a kingdom.\xe2\x80\x99 So the brothers agreed that this\r\nplan would be much better than either quarrelling or marrying a lady who\r\nhad no mind to have them. And the king then gave to each half a kingdom,\r\nas he had said; and they lived very happily the rest of their days, and\r\ntook good care of their father; and somebody took better care of the\r\nyoung lady, than to let either the dragon or one of the craftsmen have\r\nher again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLILY AND THE LION\r\n\r\nA merchant, who had three daughters, was once setting out upon a\r\njourney; but before he went he asked each daughter what gift he should\r\nbring back for her. The eldest wished for pearls; the second for jewels;\r\nbut the third, who was called Lily, said, \xe2\x80\x98Dear father, bring me a\r\nrose.\xe2\x80\x99 Now it was no easy task to find a rose, for it was the middle\r\nof winter; yet as she was his prettiest daughter, and was very fond of\r\nflowers, her father said he would try what he could do. So he kissed all\r\nthree, and bid them goodbye.\r\n\r\nAnd when the time came for him to go home, he had bought pearls and\r\njewels for the two eldest, but he had sought everywhere in vain for the\r\nrose; and when he went into any garden and asked for such a thing, the\r\npeople laughed at him, and asked him whether he thought roses grew in\r\nsnow. This grieved him very much, for Lily was his dearest child; and as\r\nhe was journeying home, thinking what he should bring her, he came to a\r\nfine castle; and around the castle was a garden, in one half of which it\r\nseemed to be summer-time and in the other half winter. On one side the\r\nfinest flowers were in full bloom, and on the other everything looked\r\ndreary and buried in the snow. \xe2\x80\x98A lucky hit!\xe2\x80\x99 said he, as he called to\r\nhis servant, and told him to go to a beautiful bed of roses that was\r\nthere, and bring him away one of the finest flowers.\r\n\r\nThis done, they were riding away well pleased, when up sprang a fierce\r\nlion, and roared out, \xe2\x80\x98Whoever has stolen my roses shall be eaten up\r\nalive!\xe2\x80\x99 Then the man said, \xe2\x80\x98I knew not that the garden belonged to you;\r\ncan nothing save my life?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98No!\xe2\x80\x99 said the lion, \xe2\x80\x98nothing, unless you\r\nundertake to give me whatever meets you on your return home; if you\r\nagree to this, I will give you your life, and the rose too for your\r\ndaughter.\xe2\x80\x99 But the man was unwilling to do so and said, \xe2\x80\x98It may be my\r\nyoungest daughter, who loves me most, and always runs to meet me when\r\nI go home.\xe2\x80\x99 Then the servant was greatly frightened, and said, \xe2\x80\x98It may\r\nperhaps be only a cat or a dog.\xe2\x80\x99 And at last the man yielded with a\r\nheavy heart, and took the rose; and said he would give the lion whatever\r\nshould meet him first on his return.\r\n\r\nAnd as he came near home, it was Lily, his youngest and dearest\r\ndaughter, that met him; she came running, and kissed him, and welcomed\r\nhim home; and when she saw that he had brought her the rose, she was\r\nstill more glad. But her father began to be very sorrowful, and to weep,\r\nsaying, \xe2\x80\x98Alas, my dearest child! I have bought this flower at a high\r\nprice, for I have said I would give you to a wild lion; and when he has\r\nyou, he will tear you in pieces, and eat you.\xe2\x80\x99 Then he told her all that\r\nhad happened, and said she should not go, let what would happen.\r\n\r\nBut she comforted him, and said, \xe2\x80\x98Dear father, the word you have given\r\nmust be kept; I will go to the lion, and soothe him: perhaps he will let\r\nme come safe home again.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe next morning she asked the way she was to go, and took leave of her\r\nfather, and went forth with a bold heart into the wood. But the lion was\r\nan enchanted prince. By day he and all his court were lions, but in the\r\nevening they took their right forms again. And when Lily came to the\r\ncastle, he welcomed her so courteously that she agreed to marry him. The\r\nwedding-feast was held, and they lived happily together a long time. The\r\nprince was only to be seen as soon as evening came, and then he held his\r\ncourt; but every morning he left his bride, and went away by himself,\r\nshe knew not whither, till the night came again.\r\n\r\nAfter some time he said to her, \xe2\x80\x98Tomorrow there will be a great feast in\r\nyour father\xe2\x80\x99s house, for your eldest sister is to be married; and if\r\nyou wish to go and visit her my lions shall lead you thither.\xe2\x80\x99 Then she\r\nrejoiced much at the thoughts of seeing her father once more, and set\r\nout with the lions; and everyone was overjoyed to see her, for they had\r\nthought her dead long since. But she told them how happy she was, and\r\nstayed till the feast was over, and then went back to the wood.\r\n\r\nHer second sister was soon after married, and when Lily was asked to\r\ngo to the wedding, she said to the prince, \xe2\x80\x98I will not go alone this\r\ntime--you must go with me.\xe2\x80\x99 But he would not, and said that it would be\r\na very hazardous thing; for if the least ray of the torch-light should\r\nfall upon him his enchantment would become still worse, for he should be\r\nchanged into a dove, and be forced to wander about the world for seven\r\nlong years. However, she gave him no rest, and said she would take care\r\nno light should fall upon him. So at last they set out together, and\r\ntook with them their little child; and she chose a large hall with thick\r\nwalls for him to sit in while the wedding-torches were lighted; but,\r\nunluckily, no one saw that there was a crack in the door. Then the\r\nwedding was held with great pomp, but as the train came from the church,\r\nand passed with the torches before the hall, a very small ray of light\r\nfell upon the prince. In a moment he disappeared, and when his wife came\r\nin and looked for him, she found only a white dove; and it said to her,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Seven years must I fly up and down over the face of the earth, but\r\nevery now and then I will let fall a white feather, that will show you\r\nthe way I am going; follow it, and at last you may overtake and set me\r\nfree.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThis said, he flew out at the door, and poor Lily followed; and every\r\nnow and then a white feather fell, and showed her the way she was to\r\njourney. Thus she went roving on through the wide world, and looked\r\nneither to the right hand nor to the left, nor took any rest, for seven\r\nyears. Then she began to be glad, and thought to herself that the time\r\nwas fast coming when all her troubles should end; yet repose was still\r\nfar off, for one day as she was travelling on she missed the white\r\nfeather, and when she lifted up her eyes she could nowhere see the dove.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Now,\xe2\x80\x99 thought she to herself, \xe2\x80\x98no aid of man can be of use to me.\xe2\x80\x99 So\r\nshe went to the sun and said, \xe2\x80\x98Thou shinest everywhere, on the hill\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntop and the valley\xe2\x80\x99s depth--hast thou anywhere seen my white dove?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No,\xe2\x80\x99 said the sun, \xe2\x80\x98I have not seen it; but I will give thee a\r\ncasket--open it when thy hour of need comes.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSo she thanked the sun, and went on her way till eventide; and when\r\nthe moon arose, she cried unto it, and said, \xe2\x80\x98Thou shinest through the\r\nnight, over field and grove--hast thou nowhere seen my white dove?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No,\xe2\x80\x99 said the moon, \xe2\x80\x98I cannot help thee but I will give thee an\r\negg--break it when need comes.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThen she thanked the moon, and went on till the night-wind blew; and she\r\nraised up her voice to it, and said, \xe2\x80\x98Thou blowest through every tree\r\nand under every leaf--hast thou not seen my white dove?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98No,\xe2\x80\x99 said the\r\nnight-wind, \xe2\x80\x98but I will ask three other winds; perhaps they have seen\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x99 Then the east wind and the west wind came, and said they too had\r\nnot seen it, but the south wind said, \xe2\x80\x98I have seen the white dove--he\r\nhas fled to the Red Sea, and is changed once more into a lion, for the\r\nseven years are passed away, and there he is fighting with a dragon;\r\nand the dragon is an enchanted princess, who seeks to separate him from\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x99 Then the night-wind said, \xe2\x80\x98I will give thee counsel. Go to the\r\nRed Sea; on the right shore stand many rods--count them, and when thou\r\ncomest to the eleventh, break it off, and smite the dragon with it; and\r\nso the lion will have the victory, and both of them will appear to you\r\nin their own forms. Then look round and thou wilt see a griffin, winged\r\nlike bird, sitting by the Red Sea; jump on to his back with thy beloved\r\none as quickly as possible, and he will carry you over the waters to\r\nyour home. I will also give thee this nut,\xe2\x80\x99 continued the night-wind.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98When you are half-way over, throw it down, and out of the waters will\r\nimmediately spring up a high nut-tree on which the griffin will be able\r\nto rest, otherwise he would not have the strength to bear you the whole\r\nway; if, therefore, thou dost forget to throw down the nut, he will let\r\nyou both fall into the sea.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSo our poor wanderer went forth, and found all as the night-wind had\r\nsaid; and she plucked the eleventh rod, and smote the dragon, and the\r\nlion forthwith became a prince, and the dragon a princess again. But\r\nno sooner was the princess released from the spell, than she seized\r\nthe prince by the arm and sprang on to the griffin\xe2\x80\x99s back, and went off\r\ncarrying the prince away with her.\r\n\r\nThus the unhappy traveller was again forsaken and forlorn; but she\r\ntook heart and said, \xe2\x80\x98As far as the wind blows, and so long as the cock\r\ncrows, I will journey on, till I find him once again.\xe2\x80\x99 She went on for\r\na long, long way, till at length she came to the castle whither the\r\nprincess had carried the prince; and there was a feast got ready, and\r\nshe heard that the wedding was about to be held. \xe2\x80\x98Heaven aid me now!\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsaid she; and she took the casket that the sun had given her, and found\r\nthat within it lay a dress as dazzling as the sun itself. So she put it\r\non, and went into the palace, and all the people gazed upon her; and\r\nthe dress pleased the bride so much that she asked whether it was to be\r\nsold. \xe2\x80\x98Not for gold and silver.\xe2\x80\x99 said she, \xe2\x80\x98but for flesh and blood.\xe2\x80\x99\r\nThe princess asked what she meant, and she said, \xe2\x80\x98Let me speak with the\r\nbridegroom this night in his chamber, and I will give thee the dress.\xe2\x80\x99\r\nAt last the princess agreed, but she told her chamberlain to give the\r\nprince a sleeping draught, that he might not hear or see her. When\r\nevening came, and the prince had fallen asleep, she was led into\r\nhis chamber, and she sat herself down at his feet, and said: \xe2\x80\x98I have\r\nfollowed thee seven years. I have been to the sun, the moon, and the\r\nnight-wind, to seek thee, and at last I have helped thee to overcome\r\nthe dragon. Wilt thou then forget me quite?\xe2\x80\x99 But the prince all the time\r\nslept so soundly, that her voice only passed over him, and seemed like\r\nthe whistling of the wind among the fir-trees.\r\n\r\nThen poor Lily was led away, and forced to give up the golden dress; and\r\nwhen she saw that there was no help for her, she went out into a meadow,\r\nand sat herself down and wept. But as she sat she bethought herself of\r\nthe egg that the moon had given her; and when she broke it, there ran\r\nout a hen and twelve chickens of pure gold, that played about, and then\r\nnestled under the old one\xe2\x80\x99s wings, so as to form the most beautiful\r\nsight in the world. And she rose up and drove them before her, till the\r\nbride saw them from her window, and was so pleased that she came forth\r\nand asked her if she would sell the brood. \xe2\x80\x98Not for gold or silver, but\r\nfor flesh and blood: let me again this evening speak with the bridegroom\r\nin his chamber, and I will give thee the whole brood.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThen the princess thought to betray her as before, and agreed to\r\nwhat she asked: but when the prince went to his chamber he asked\r\nthe chamberlain why the wind had whistled so in the night. And the\r\nchamberlain told him all--how he had given him a sleeping draught, and\r\nhow a poor maiden had come and spoken to him in his chamber, and was\r\nto come again that night. Then the prince took care to throw away the\r\nsleeping draught; and when Lily came and began again to tell him what\r\nwoes had befallen her, and how faithful and true to him she had been,\r\nhe knew his beloved wife\xe2\x80\x99s voice, and sprang up, and said, \xe2\x80\x98You have\r\nawakened me as from a dream, for the strange princess had thrown a spell\r\naround me, so that I had altogether forgotten you; but Heaven hath sent\r\nyou to me in a lucky hour.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAnd they stole away out of the palace by night unawares, and seated\r\nthemselves on the griffin, who flew back with them over the Red Sea.\r\nWhen they were half-way across Lily let the nut fall into the water,\r\nand immediately a large nut-tree arose from the sea, whereon the griffin\r\nrested for a while, and then carried them safely home. There they found\r\ntheir child, now grown up to be comely and fair; and after all their\r\ntroubles they lived happily together to the end of their days.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FOX AND THE HORSE\r\n\r\nA farmer had a horse that had been an excellent faithful servant to\r\nhim: but he was now grown too old to work; so the farmer would give him\r\nnothing more to eat, and said, \xe2\x80\x98I want you no longer, so take yourself\r\noff out of my stable; I shall not take you back again until you are\r\nstronger than a lion.\xe2\x80\x99 Then he opened the door and turned him adrift.\r\n\r\nThe poor horse was very melancholy, and wandered up and down in the\r\nwood, seeking some little shelter from the cold wind and rain. Presently\r\na fox met him: \xe2\x80\x98What\xe2\x80\x99s the matter, my friend?\xe2\x80\x99 said he, \xe2\x80\x98why do you hang\r\ndown your head and look so lonely and woe-begone?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Ah!\xe2\x80\x99 replied the\r\nhorse, \xe2\x80\x98justice and avarice never dwell in one house; my master has\r\nforgotten all that I have done for him so many years, and because I\r\ncan no longer work he has turned me adrift, and says unless I become\r\nstronger than a lion he will not take me back again; what chance can I\r\nhave of that? he knows I have none, or he would not talk so.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHowever, the fox bid him be of good cheer, and said, \xe2\x80\x98I will help you;\r\nlie down there, stretch yourself out quite stiff, and pretend to be\r\ndead.\xe2\x80\x99 The horse did as he was told, and the fox went straight to the\r\nlion who lived in a cave close by, and said to him, \xe2\x80\x98A little way off\r\nlies a dead horse; come with me and you may make an excellent meal of\r\nhis carcase.\xe2\x80\x99 The lion was greatly pleased, and set off immediately; and\r\nwhen they came to the horse, the fox said, \xe2\x80\x98You will not be able to eat\r\nhim comfortably here; I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you what--I will tie you fast to\r\nhis tail, and then you can draw him to your den, and eat him at your\r\nleisure.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThis advice pleased the lion, so he laid himself down quietly for the\r\nfox to make him fast to the horse. But the fox managed to tie his legs\r\ntogether and bound all so hard and fast that with all his strength he\r\ncould not set himself free. When the work was done, the fox clapped the\r\nhorse on the shoulder, and said, \xe2\x80\x98Jip! Dobbin! Jip!\xe2\x80\x99 Then up he sprang,\r\nand moved off, dragging the lion behind him. The beast began to roar\r\nand bellow, till all the birds of the wood flew away for fright; but the\r\nhorse let him sing on, and made his way quietly over the fields to his\r\nmaster\xe2\x80\x99s house.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Here he is, master,\xe2\x80\x99 said he, \xe2\x80\x98I have got the better of him\xe2\x80\x99: and when\r\nthe farmer saw his old servant, his heart relented, and he said. \xe2\x80\x98Thou\r\nshalt stay in thy stable and be well taken care of.\xe2\x80\x99 And so the poor old\r\nhorse had plenty to eat, and lived--till he died.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BLUE LIGHT\r\n\r\nThere was once upon a time a soldier who for many years had served the\r\nking faithfully, but when the war came to an end could serve no longer\r\nbecause of the many wounds which he had received. The king said to him:\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You may return to your home, I need you no longer, and you will not\r\nreceive any more money, for he only receives wages who renders me\r\nservice for them.\xe2\x80\x99 Then the soldier did not know how to earn a living,\r\nwent away greatly troubled, and walked the whole day, until in the\r\nevening he entered a forest. When darkness came on, he saw a light,\r\nwhich he went up to, and came to a house wherein lived a witch. \xe2\x80\x98Do give\r\nme one night\xe2\x80\x99s lodging, and a little to eat and drink,\xe2\x80\x99 said he to\r\nher, \xe2\x80\x98or I shall starve.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Oho!\xe2\x80\x99 she answered, \xe2\x80\x98who gives anything to a\r\nrun-away soldier? Yet will I be compassionate, and take you in, if you\r\nwill do what I wish.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98What do you wish?\xe2\x80\x99 said the soldier. \xe2\x80\x98That you\r\nshould dig all round my garden for me, tomorrow.\xe2\x80\x99 The soldier consented,\r\nand next day laboured with all his strength, but could not finish it by\r\nthe evening. \xe2\x80\x98I see well enough,\xe2\x80\x99 said the witch, \xe2\x80\x98that you can do no\r\nmore today, but I will keep you yet another night, in payment for\r\nwhich you must tomorrow chop me a load of wood, and chop it small.\xe2\x80\x99 The\r\nsoldier spent the whole day in doing it, and in the evening the witch\r\nproposed that he should stay one night more. \xe2\x80\x98Tomorrow, you shall only\r\ndo me a very trifling piece of work. Behind my house, there is an old\r\ndry well, into which my light has fallen, it burns blue, and never goes\r\nout, and you shall bring it up again.\xe2\x80\x99 Next day the old woman took him\r\nto the well, and let him down in a basket. He found the blue light, and\r\nmade her a signal to draw him up again. She did draw him up, but when he\r\ncame near the edge, she stretched down her hand and wanted to take the\r\nblue light away from him. \xe2\x80\x98No,\xe2\x80\x99 said he, perceiving her evil intention,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I will not give you the light until I am standing with both feet upon\r\nthe ground.\xe2\x80\x99 The witch fell into a passion, let him fall again into the\r\nwell, and went away.\r\n\r\nThe poor soldier fell without injury on the moist ground, and the blue\r\nlight went on burning, but of what use was that to him? He saw very well\r\nthat he could not escape death. He sat for a while very sorrowfully,\r\nthen suddenly he felt in his pocket and found his tobacco pipe, which\r\nwas still half full. \xe2\x80\x98This shall be my last pleasure,\xe2\x80\x99 thought he,\r\npulled it out, lit it at the blue light and began to smoke. When the\r\nsmoke had circled about the cavern, suddenly a little black dwarf stood\r\nbefore him, and said: \xe2\x80\x98Lord, what are your commands?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98What my commands\r\nare?\xe2\x80\x99 replied the soldier, quite astonished. \xe2\x80\x98I must do everything you\r\nbid me,\xe2\x80\x99 said the little man. \xe2\x80\x98Good,\xe2\x80\x99 said the soldier; \xe2\x80\x98then in the\r\nfirst place help me out of this well.\xe2\x80\x99 The little man took him by the\r\nhand, and led him through an underground passage, but he did not forget\r\nto take the blue light with him. On the way the dwarf showed him the\r\ntreasures which the witch had collected and hidden there, and the\r\nsoldier took as much gold as he could carry. When he was above, he said\r\nto the little man: \xe2\x80\x98Now go and bind the old witch, and carry her before\r\nthe judge.\xe2\x80\x99 In a short time she came by like the wind, riding on a wild\r\ntom-cat and screaming frightfully. Nor was it long before the little man\r\nreappeared. \xe2\x80\x98It is all done,\xe2\x80\x99 said he, \xe2\x80\x98and the witch is already hanging\r\non the gallows. What further commands has my lord?\xe2\x80\x99 inquired the dwarf.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98At this moment, none,\xe2\x80\x99 answered the soldier; \xe2\x80\x98you can return home, only\r\nbe at hand immediately, if I summon you.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Nothing more is needed than\r\nthat you should light your pipe at the blue light, and I will appear\r\nbefore you at once.\xe2\x80\x99 Thereupon he vanished from his sight.\r\n\r\nThe soldier returned to the town from which he came. He went to the\r\nbest inn, ordered himself handsome clothes, and then bade the landlord\r\nfurnish him a room as handsome as possible. When it was ready and the\r\nsoldier had taken possession of it, he summoned the little black manikin\r\nand said: \xe2\x80\x98I have served the king faithfully, but he has dismissed me,\r\nand left me to hunger, and now I want to take my revenge.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98What am I to\r\ndo?\xe2\x80\x99 asked the little man. \xe2\x80\x98Late at night, when the king\xe2\x80\x99s daughter is\r\nin bed, bring her here in her sleep, she shall do servant\xe2\x80\x99s work for\r\nme.\xe2\x80\x99 The manikin said: \xe2\x80\x98That is an easy thing for me to do, but a very\r\ndangerous thing for you, for if it is discovered, you will fare ill.\xe2\x80\x99\r\nWhen twelve o\xe2\x80\x99clock had struck, the door sprang open, and the manikin\r\ncarried in the princess. \xe2\x80\x98Aha! are you there?\xe2\x80\x99 cried the soldier, \xe2\x80\x98get\r\nto your work at once! Fetch the broom and sweep the chamber.\xe2\x80\x99 When\r\nshe had done this, he ordered her to come to his chair, and then he\r\nstretched out his feet and said: \xe2\x80\x98Pull off my boots,\xe2\x80\x99 and then he\r\nthrew them in her face, and made her pick them up again, and clean\r\nand brighten them. She, however, did everything he bade her, without\r\nopposition, silently and with half-shut eyes. When the first cock\r\ncrowed, the manikin carried her back to the royal palace, and laid her\r\nin her bed.\r\n\r\nNext morning when the princess arose she went to her father, and told\r\nhim that she had had a very strange dream. \xe2\x80\x98I was carried through the\r\nstreets with the rapidity of lightning,\xe2\x80\x99 said she, \xe2\x80\x98and taken into a\r\nsoldier\xe2\x80\x99s room, and I had to wait upon him like a servant, sweep his\r\nroom, clean his boots, and do all kinds of menial work. It was only a\r\ndream, and yet I am just as tired as if I really had done everything.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The dream may have been true,\xe2\x80\x99 said the king. \xe2\x80\x98I will give you a piece\r\nof advice. Fill your pocket full of peas, and make a small hole in the\r\npocket, and then if you are carried away again, they will fall out and\r\nleave a track in the streets.\xe2\x80\x99 But unseen by the king, the manikin was\r\nstanding beside him when he said that, and heard all. At night when\r\nthe sleeping princess was again carried through the streets, some peas\r\ncertainly did fall out of her pocket, but they made no track, for the\r\ncrafty manikin had just before scattered peas in every street there\r\nwas. And again the princess was compelled to do servant\xe2\x80\x99s work until\r\ncock-crow.\r\n\r\nNext morning the king sent his people out to seek the track, but it was\r\nall in vain, for in every street poor children were sitting, picking up\r\npeas, and saying: \xe2\x80\x98It must have rained peas, last night.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98We must think\r\nof something else,\xe2\x80\x99 said the king; \xe2\x80\x98keep your shoes on when you go to\r\nbed, and before you come back from the place where you are taken, hide\r\none of them there, I will soon contrive to find it.\xe2\x80\x99 The black manikin\r\nheard this plot, and at night when the soldier again ordered him to\r\nbring the princess, revealed it to him, and told him that he knew of no\r\nexpedient to counteract this stratagem, and that if the shoe were found\r\nin the soldier\xe2\x80\x99s house it would go badly with him. \xe2\x80\x98Do what I bid you,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nreplied the soldier, and again this third night the princess was obliged\r\nto work like a servant, but before she went away, she hid her shoe under\r\nthe bed.\r\n\r\nNext morning the king had the entire town searched for his daughter\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nshoe. It was found at the soldier\xe2\x80\x99s, and the soldier himself, who at the\r\nentreaty of the dwarf had gone outside the gate, was soon brought back,\r\nand thrown into prison. In his flight he had forgotten the most valuable\r\nthings he had, the blue light and the gold, and had only one ducat in\r\nhis pocket. And now loaded with chains, he was standing at the window of\r\nhis dungeon, when he chanced to see one of his comrades passing by. The\r\nsoldier tapped at the pane of glass, and when this man came up, said to\r\nhim: \xe2\x80\x98Be so kind as to fetch me the small bundle I have left lying in\r\nthe inn, and I will give you a ducat for doing it.\xe2\x80\x99 His comrade ran\r\nthither and brought him what he wanted. As soon as the soldier was alone\r\nagain, he lighted his pipe and summoned the black manikin. \xe2\x80\x98Have no\r\nfear,\xe2\x80\x99 said the latter to his master. \xe2\x80\x98Go wheresoever they take you, and\r\nlet them do what they will, only take the blue light with you.\xe2\x80\x99 Next day\r\nthe soldier was tried, and though he had done nothing wicked, the judge\r\ncondemned him to death. When he was led forth to die, he begged a last\r\nfavour of the king. \xe2\x80\x98What is it?\xe2\x80\x99 asked the king. \xe2\x80\x98That I may smoke one\r\nmore pipe on my way.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98You may smoke three,\xe2\x80\x99 answered the king, \xe2\x80\x98but do\r\nnot imagine that I will spare your life.\xe2\x80\x99 Then the soldier pulled out\r\nhis pipe and lighted it at the blue light, and as soon as a few wreaths\r\nof smoke had ascended, the manikin was there with a small cudgel in his\r\nhand, and said: \xe2\x80\x98What does my lord command?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Strike down to earth that\r\nfalse judge there, and his constable, and spare not the king who has\r\ntreated me so ill.\xe2\x80\x99 Then the manikin fell on them like lightning,\r\ndarting this way and that way, and whosoever was so much as touched by\r\nhis cudgel fell to earth, and did not venture to stir again. The king\r\nwas terrified; he threw himself on the soldier\xe2\x80\x99s mercy, and merely to\r\nbe allowed to live at all, gave him his kingdom for his own, and his\r\ndaughter to wife.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE RAVEN\r\n\r\nThere was once a queen who had a little daughter, still too young to run\r\nalone. One day the child was very troublesome, and the mother could not\r\nquiet it, do what she would. She grew impatient, and seeing the ravens\r\nflying round the castle, she opened the window, and said: \xe2\x80\x98I wish you\r\nwere a raven and would fly away, then I should have a little peace.\xe2\x80\x99\r\nScarcely were the words out of her mouth, when the child in her arms was\r\nturned into a raven, and flew away from her through the open window. The\r\nbird took its flight to a dark wood and remained there for a long time,\r\nand meanwhile the parents could hear nothing of their child.\r\n\r\nLong after this, a man was making his way through the wood when he heard\r\na raven calling, and he followed the sound of the voice. As he drew\r\nnear, the raven said, \xe2\x80\x98I am by birth a king\xe2\x80\x99s daughter, but am now under\r\nthe spell of some enchantment; you can, however, set me free.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98What\r\nam I to do?\xe2\x80\x99 he asked. She replied, \xe2\x80\x98Go farther into the wood until you\r\ncome to a house, wherein lives an old woman; she will offer you food and\r\ndrink, but you must not take of either; if you do, you will fall into\r\na deep sleep, and will not be able to help me. In the garden behind the\r\nhouse is a large tan-heap, and on that you must stand and watch for me.\r\nI shall drive there in my carriage at two o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the afternoon for\r\nthree successive days; the first day it will be drawn by four white, the\r\nsecond by four chestnut, and the last by four black horses; but if you\r\nfail to keep awake and I find you sleeping, I shall not be set free.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe man promised to do all that she wished, but the raven said, \xe2\x80\x98Alas! I\r\nknow even now that you will take something from the woman and be unable\r\nto save me.\xe2\x80\x99 The man assured her again that he would on no account touch\r\na thing to eat or drink.\r\n\r\nWhen he came to the house and went inside, the old woman met him, and\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x98Poor man! how tired you are! Come in and rest and let me give you\r\nsomething to eat and drink.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No,\xe2\x80\x99 answered the man, \xe2\x80\x98I will neither eat not drink.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBut she would not leave him alone, and urged him saying, \xe2\x80\x98If you will\r\nnot eat anything, at least you might take a draught of wine; one drink\r\ncounts for nothing,\xe2\x80\x99 and at last he allowed himself to be persuaded, and\r\ndrank.\r\n\r\nAs it drew towards the appointed hour, he went outside into the garden\r\nand mounted the tan-heap to await the raven. Suddenly a feeling of\r\nfatigue came over him, and unable to resist it, he lay down for a little\r\nwhile, fully determined, however, to keep awake; but in another minute\r\nhis eyes closed of their own accord, and he fell into such a deep sleep,\r\nthat all the noises in the world would not have awakened him. At two\r\no\xe2\x80\x99clock the raven came driving along, drawn by her four white horses;\r\nbut even before she reached the spot, she said to herself, sighing, \xe2\x80\x98I\r\nknow he has fallen asleep.\xe2\x80\x99 When she entered the garden, there she found\r\nhim as she had feared, lying on the tan-heap, fast asleep. She got out\r\nof her carriage and went to him; she called him and shook him, but it\r\nwas all in vain, he still continued sleeping.\r\n\r\nThe next day at noon, the old woman came to him again with food and\r\ndrink which he at first refused. At last, overcome by her persistent\r\nentreaties that he would take something, he lifted the glass and drank\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nTowards two o\xe2\x80\x99clock he went into the garden and on to the tan-heap to\r\nwatch for the raven. He had not been there long before he began to feel\r\nso tired that his limbs seemed hardly able to support him, and he could\r\nnot stand upright any longer; so again he lay down and fell fast asleep.\r\nAs the raven drove along her four chestnut horses, she said sorrowfully\r\nto herself, \xe2\x80\x98I know he has fallen asleep.\xe2\x80\x99 She went as before to look\r\nfor him, but he slept, and it was impossible to awaken him.\r\n\r\nThe following day the old woman said to him, \xe2\x80\x98What is this? You are not\r\neating or drinking anything, do you want to kill yourself?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe answered, \xe2\x80\x98I may not and will not either eat or drink.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBut she put down the dish of food and the glass of wine in front of him,\r\nand when he smelt the wine, he was unable to resist the temptation, and\r\ntook a deep draught.\r\n\r\nWhen the hour came round again he went as usual on to the tan-heap in\r\nthe garden to await the king\xe2\x80\x99s daughter, but he felt even more overcome\r\nwith weariness than on the two previous days, and throwing himself down,\r\nhe slept like a log. At two o\xe2\x80\x99clock the raven could be seen approaching,\r\nand this time her coachman and everything about her, as well as her\r\nhorses, were black.\r\n\r\nShe was sadder than ever as she drove along, and said mournfully, \xe2\x80\x98I\r\nknow he has fallen asleep, and will not be able to set me free.\xe2\x80\x99 She\r\nfound him sleeping heavily, and all her efforts to awaken him were of no\r\navail. Then she placed beside him a loaf, and some meat, and a flask\r\nof wine, of such a kind, that however much he took of them, they would\r\nnever grow less. After that she drew a gold ring, on which her name was\r\nengraved, off her finger, and put it upon one of his. Finally, she laid\r\na letter near him, in which, after giving him particulars of the food\r\nand drink she had left for him, she finished with the following words:\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I see that as long as you remain here you will never be able to set me\r\nfree; if, however, you still wish to do so, come to the golden castle\r\nof Stromberg; this is well within your power to accomplish.\xe2\x80\x99 She then\r\nreturned to her carriage and drove to the golden castle of Stromberg.\r\n\r\nWhen the man awoke and found that he had been sleeping, he was grieved\r\nat heart, and said, \xe2\x80\x98She has no doubt been here and driven away again,\r\nand it is now too late for me to save her.\xe2\x80\x99 Then his eyes fell on the\r\nthings which were lying beside him; he read the letter, and knew from it\r\nall that had happened. He rose up without delay, eager to start on his\r\nway and to reach the castle of Stromberg, but he had no idea in which\r\ndirection he ought to go. He travelled about a long time in search of it\r\nand came at last to a dark forest, through which he went on walking for\r\nfourteen days and still could not find a way out. Once more the night\r\ncame on, and worn out he lay down under a bush and fell asleep. Again\r\nthe next day he pursued his way through the forest, and that evening,\r\nthinking to rest again, he lay down as before, but he heard such a\r\nhowling and wailing that he found it impossible to sleep. He waited till\r\nit was darker and people had begun to light up their houses, and then\r\nseeing a little glimmer ahead of him, he went towards it.\r\n\r\nHe found that the light came from a house which looked smaller than\r\nit really was, from the contrast of its height with that of an immense\r\ngiant who stood in front of it. He thought to himself, \xe2\x80\x98If the giant\r\nsees me going in, my life will not be worth much.\xe2\x80\x99 However, after a\r\nwhile he summoned up courage and went forward. When the giant saw him,\r\nhe called out, \xe2\x80\x98It is lucky for that you have come, for I have not had\r\nanything to eat for a long time. I can have you now for my supper.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98I\r\nwould rather you let that alone,\xe2\x80\x99 said the man, \xe2\x80\x98for I do not willingly\r\ngive myself up to be eaten; if you are wanting food I have enough to\r\nsatisfy your hunger.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98If that is so,\xe2\x80\x99 replied the giant, \xe2\x80\x98I will leave\r\nyou in peace; I only thought of eating you because I had nothing else.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSo they went indoors together and sat down, and the man brought out the\r\nbread, meat, and wine, which although he had eaten and drunk of them,\r\nwere still unconsumed. The giant was pleased with the good cheer, and\r\nate and drank to his heart\xe2\x80\x99s content. When he had finished his supper\r\nthe man asked him if he could direct him to the castle of Stromberg.\r\nThe giant said, \xe2\x80\x98I will look on my map; on it are marked all the towns,\r\nvillages, and houses.\xe2\x80\x99 So he fetched his map, and looked for the castle,\r\nbut could not find it. \xe2\x80\x98Never mind,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, \xe2\x80\x98I have larger maps\r\nupstairs in the cupboard, we will look on those,\xe2\x80\x99 but they searched in\r\nvain, for the castle was not marked even on these. The man now thought\r\nhe should like to continue his journey, but the giant begged him to\r\nremain for a day or two longer until the return of his brother, who was\r\naway in search of provisions. When the brother came home, they asked him\r\nabout the castle of Stromberg, and he told them he would look on his own\r\nmaps as soon as he had eaten and appeased his hunger. Accordingly, when\r\nhe had finished his supper, they all went up together to his room and\r\nlooked through his maps, but the castle was not to be found. Then he\r\nfetched other older maps, and they went on looking for the castle until\r\nat last they found it, but it was many thousand miles away. \xe2\x80\x98How shall I\r\nbe able to get there?\xe2\x80\x99 asked the man. \xe2\x80\x98I have two hours to spare,\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nthe giant, \xe2\x80\x98and I will carry you into the neighbourhood of the castle; I\r\nmust then return to look after the child who is in our care.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe giant, thereupon, carried the man to within about a hundred leagues\r\nof the castle, where he left him, saying, \xe2\x80\x98You will be able to walk the\r\nremainder of the way yourself.\xe2\x80\x99 The man journeyed on day and night\r\ntill he reached the golden castle of Stromberg. He found it situated,\r\nhowever, on a glass mountain, and looking up from the foot he saw the\r\nenchanted maiden drive round her castle and then go inside. He was\r\noverjoyed to see her, and longed to get to the top of the mountain, but\r\nthe sides were so slippery that every time he attempted to climb he\r\nfell back again. When he saw that it was impossible to reach her, he was\r\ngreatly grieved, and said to himself, \xe2\x80\x98I will remain here and wait for\r\nher,\xe2\x80\x99 so he built himself a little hut, and there he sat and watched for\r\na whole year, and every day he saw the king\xe2\x80\x99s daughter driving round her\r\ncastle, but still was unable to get nearer to her.\r\n\r\nLooking out from his hut one day he saw three robbers fighting and he\r\ncalled out to them, \xe2\x80\x98God be with you.\xe2\x80\x99 They stopped when they heard the\r\ncall, but looking round and seeing nobody, they went on again with their\r\nfighting, which now became more furious. \xe2\x80\x98God be with you,\xe2\x80\x99 he cried\r\nagain, and again they paused and looked about, but seeing no one went\r\nback to their fighting. A third time he called out, \xe2\x80\x98God be with you,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nand then thinking he should like to know the cause of dispute between\r\nthe three men, he went out and asked them why they were fighting so\r\nangrily with one another. One of them said that he had found a stick,\r\nand that he had but to strike it against any door through which he\r\nwished to pass, and it immediately flew open. Another told him that he\r\nhad found a cloak which rendered its wearer invisible; and the third had\r\ncaught a horse which would carry its rider over any obstacle, and even\r\nup the glass mountain. They had been unable to decide whether they\r\nwould keep together and have the things in common, or whether they would\r\nseparate. On hearing this, the man said, \xe2\x80\x98I will give you something in\r\nexchange for those three things; not money, for that I have not got,\r\nbut something that is of far more value. I must first, however, prove\r\nwhether all you have told me about your three things is true.\xe2\x80\x99 The\r\nrobbers, therefore, made him get on the horse, and handed him the stick\r\nand the cloak, and when he had put this round him he was no longer\r\nvisible. Then he fell upon them with the stick and beat them one after\r\nanother, crying, \xe2\x80\x98There, you idle vagabonds, you have got what you\r\ndeserve; are you satisfied now!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAfter this he rode up the glass mountain. When he reached the gate of\r\nthe castle, he found it closed, but he gave it a blow with his stick,\r\nand it flew wide open at once and he passed through. He mounted the\r\nsteps and entered the room where the maiden was sitting, with a golden\r\ngoblet full of wine in front of her. She could not see him for he still\r\nwore his cloak. He took the ring which she had given him off his finger,\r\nand threw it into the goblet, so that it rang as it touched the bottom.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That is my own ring,\xe2\x80\x99 she exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x98and if that is so the man must\r\nalso be here who is coming to set me free.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe sought for him about the castle, but could find him nowhere.\r\nMeanwhile he had gone outside again and mounted his horse and thrown off\r\nthe cloak. When therefore she came to the castle gate she saw him, and\r\ncried aloud for joy. Then he dismounted and took her in his arms; and\r\nshe kissed him, and said, \xe2\x80\x98Now you have indeed set me free, and tomorrow\r\nwe will celebrate our marriage.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GOLDEN GOOSE\r\n\r\nThere was a man who had three sons, the youngest of whom was called\r\nDummling,[*] and was despised, mocked, and sneered at on every occasion.\r\n\r\nIt happened that the eldest wanted to go into the forest to hew wood,\r\nand before he went his mother gave him a beautiful sweet cake and a\r\nbottle of wine in order that he might not suffer from hunger or thirst.\r\n\r\nWhen he entered the forest he met a little grey-haired old man who bade\r\nhim good day, and said: \xe2\x80\x98Do give me a piece of cake out of your pocket,\r\nand let me have a draught of your wine; I am so hungry and thirsty.\xe2\x80\x99 But\r\nthe clever son answered: \xe2\x80\x98If I give you my cake and wine, I shall have\r\nnone for myself; be off with you,\xe2\x80\x99 and he left the little man standing\r\nand went on.\r\n\r\nBut when he began to hew down a tree, it was not long before he made a\r\nfalse stroke, and the axe cut him in the arm, so that he had to go home\r\nand have it bound up. And this was the little grey man\xe2\x80\x99s doing.\r\n\r\nAfter this the second son went into the forest, and his mother gave him,\r\nlike the eldest, a cake and a bottle of wine. The little old grey man\r\nmet him likewise, and asked him for a piece of cake and a drink of wine.\r\nBut the second son, too, said sensibly enough: \xe2\x80\x98What I give you will be\r\ntaken away from myself; be off!\xe2\x80\x99 and he left the little man standing and\r\nwent on. His punishment, however, was not delayed; when he had made a\r\nfew blows at the tree he struck himself in the leg, so that he had to be\r\ncarried home.\r\n\r\nThen Dummling said: \xe2\x80\x98Father, do let me go and cut wood.\xe2\x80\x99 The father\r\nanswered: \xe2\x80\x98Your brothers have hurt themselves with it, leave it alone,\r\nyou do not understand anything about it.\xe2\x80\x99 But Dummling begged so long\r\nthat at last he said: \xe2\x80\x98Just go then, you will get wiser by hurting\r\nyourself.\xe2\x80\x99 His mother gave him a cake made with water and baked in the\r\ncinders, and with it a bottle of sour beer.\r\n\r\nWhen he came to the forest the little old grey man met him likewise,\r\nand greeting him, said: \xe2\x80\x98Give me a piece of your cake and a drink out\r\nof your bottle; I am so hungry and thirsty.\xe2\x80\x99 Dummling answered: \xe2\x80\x98I have\r\nonly cinder-cake and sour beer; if that pleases you, we will sit\r\ndown and eat.\xe2\x80\x99 So they sat down, and when Dummling pulled out his\r\ncinder-cake, it was a fine sweet cake, and the sour beer had become good\r\nwine. So they ate and drank, and after that the little man said: \xe2\x80\x98Since\r\nyou have a good heart, and are willing to divide what you have, I will\r\ngive you good luck. There stands an old tree, cut it down, and you will\r\nfind something at the roots.\xe2\x80\x99 Then the little man took leave of him.\r\n\r\nDummling went and cut down the tree, and when it fell there was a goose\r\nsitting in the roots with feathers of pure gold. He lifted her up, and\r\ntaking her with him, went to an inn where he thought he would stay the\r\nnight. Now the host had three daughters, who saw the goose and were\r\ncurious to know what such a wonderful bird might be, and would have\r\nliked to have one of its golden feathers.\r\n\r\nThe eldest thought: \xe2\x80\x98I shall soon find an opportunity of pulling out a\r\nfeather,\xe2\x80\x99 and as soon as Dummling had gone out she seized the goose by\r\nthe wing, but her finger and hand remained sticking fast to it.\r\n\r\nThe second came soon afterwards, thinking only of how she might get a\r\nfeather for herself, but she had scarcely touched her sister than she\r\nwas held fast.\r\n\r\nAt last the third also came with the like intent, and the others\r\nscreamed out: \xe2\x80\x98Keep away; for goodness\xe2\x80\x99 sake keep away!\xe2\x80\x99 But she did\r\nnot understand why she was to keep away. \xe2\x80\x98The others are there,\xe2\x80\x99 she\r\nthought, \xe2\x80\x98I may as well be there too,\xe2\x80\x99 and ran to them; but as soon as\r\nshe had touched her sister, she remained sticking fast to her. So they\r\nhad to spend the night with the goose.\r\n\r\nThe next morning Dummling took the goose under his arm and set out,\r\nwithout troubling himself about the three girls who were hanging on to\r\nit. They were obliged to run after him continually, now left, now right,\r\nwherever his legs took him.\r\n\r\nIn the middle of the fields the parson met them, and when he saw the\r\nprocession he said: \xe2\x80\x98For shame, you good-for-nothing girls, why are you\r\nrunning across the fields after this young man? Is that seemly?\xe2\x80\x99 At the\r\nsame time he seized the youngest by the hand in order to pull her away,\r\nbut as soon as he touched her he likewise stuck fast, and was himself\r\nobliged to run behind.\r\n\r\nBefore long the sexton came by and saw his master, the parson, running\r\nbehind three girls. He was astonished at this and called out: \xe2\x80\x98Hi!\r\nyour reverence, whither away so quickly? Do not forget that we have a\r\nchristening today!\xe2\x80\x99 and running after him he took him by the sleeve, but\r\nwas also held fast to it.\r\n\r\nWhilst the five were trotting thus one behind the other, two labourers\r\ncame with their hoes from the fields; the parson called out to them\r\nand begged that they would set him and the sexton free. But they had\r\nscarcely touched the sexton when they were held fast, and now there were\r\nseven of them running behind Dummling and the goose.\r\n\r\nSoon afterwards he came to a city, where a king ruled who had a daughter\r\nwho was so serious that no one could make her laugh. So he had put forth\r\na decree that whosoever should be able to make her laugh should marry\r\nher. When Dummling heard this, he went with his goose and all her train\r\nbefore the king\xe2\x80\x99s daughter, and as soon as she saw the seven people\r\nrunning on and on, one behind the other, she began to laugh quite\r\nloudly, and as if she would never stop. Thereupon Dummling asked to have\r\nher for his wife; but the king did not like the son-in-law, and made all\r\nmanner of excuses and said he must first produce a man who could drink\r\na cellarful of wine. Dummling thought of the little grey man, who could\r\ncertainly help him; so he went into the forest, and in the same place\r\nwhere he had felled the tree, he saw a man sitting, who had a very\r\nsorrowful face. Dummling asked him what he was taking to heart so\r\nsorely, and he answered: \xe2\x80\x98I have such a great thirst and cannot quench\r\nit; cold water I cannot stand, a barrel of wine I have just emptied, but\r\nthat to me is like a drop on a hot stone!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There, I can help you,\xe2\x80\x99 said Dummling, \xe2\x80\x98just come with me and you shall\r\nbe satisfied.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nHe led him into the king\xe2\x80\x99s cellar, and the man bent over the huge\r\nbarrels, and drank and drank till his loins hurt, and before the day was\r\nout he had emptied all the barrels. Then Dummling asked once more\r\nfor his bride, but the king was vexed that such an ugly fellow, whom\r\neveryone called Dummling, should take away his daughter, and he made a\r\nnew condition; he must first find a man who could eat a whole mountain\r\nof bread. Dummling did not think long, but went straight into the\r\nforest, where in the same place there sat a man who was tying up his\r\nbody with a strap, and making an awful face, and saying: \xe2\x80\x98I have eaten a\r\nwhole ovenful of rolls, but what good is that when one has such a hunger\r\nas I? My stomach remains empty, and I must tie myself up if I am not to\r\ndie of hunger.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAt this Dummling was glad, and said: \xe2\x80\x98Get up and come with me; you shall\r\neat yourself full.\xe2\x80\x99 He led him to the king\xe2\x80\x99s palace where all the\r\nflour in the whole Kingdom was collected, and from it he caused a huge\r\nmountain of bread to be baked. The man from the forest stood before it,\r\nbegan to eat, and by the end of one day the whole mountain had vanished.\r\nThen Dummling for the third time asked for his bride; but the king again\r\nsought a way out, and ordered a ship which could sail on land and on\r\nwater. \xe2\x80\x98As soon as you come sailing back in it,\xe2\x80\x99 said he, \xe2\x80\x98you shall\r\nhave my daughter for wife.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nDummling went straight into the forest, and there sat the little grey\r\nman to whom he had given his cake. When he heard what Dummling wanted,\r\nhe said: \xe2\x80\x98Since you have given me to eat and to drink, I will give you\r\nthe ship; and I do all this because you once were kind to me.\xe2\x80\x99 Then he\r\ngave him the ship which could sail on land and water, and when the king\r\nsaw that, he could no longer prevent him from having his daughter. The\r\nwedding was celebrated, and after the king\xe2\x80\x99s death, Dummling inherited\r\nhis kingdom and lived for a long time contentedly with his wife.\r\n\r\n     [*] Simpleton\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WATER OF LIFE\r\n\r\nLong before you or I were born, there reigned, in a country a great way\r\noff, a king who had three sons. This king once fell very ill--so ill\r\nthat nobody thought he could live. His sons were very much grieved\r\nat their father\xe2\x80\x99s sickness; and as they were walking together very\r\nmournfully in the garden of the palace, a little old man met them and\r\nasked what was the matter. They told him that their father was very ill,\r\nand that they were afraid nothing could save him. \xe2\x80\x98I know what would,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsaid the little old man; \xe2\x80\x98it is the Water of Life. If he could have a\r\ndraught of it he would be well again; but it is very hard to get.\xe2\x80\x99 Then\r\nthe eldest son said, \xe2\x80\x98I will soon find it\xe2\x80\x99: and he went to the sick\r\nking, and begged that he might go in search of the Water of Life, as\r\nit was the only thing that could save him. \xe2\x80\x98No,\xe2\x80\x99 said the king. \xe2\x80\x98I had\r\nrather die than place you in such great danger as you must meet with in\r\nyour journey.\xe2\x80\x99 But he begged so hard that the king let him go; and the\r\nprince thought to himself, \xe2\x80\x98If I bring my father this water, he will\r\nmake me sole heir to his kingdom.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThen he set out: and when he had gone on his way some time he came to a\r\ndeep valley, overhung with rocks and woods; and as he looked around, he\r\nsaw standing above him on one of the rocks a little ugly dwarf, with a\r\nsugarloaf cap and a scarlet cloak; and the dwarf called to him and said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Prince, whither so fast?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98What is that to thee, you ugly imp?\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nthe prince haughtily, and rode on.\r\n\r\nBut the dwarf was enraged at his behaviour, and laid a fairy spell\r\nof ill-luck upon him; so that as he rode on the mountain pass became\r\nnarrower and narrower, and at last the way was so straitened that he\r\ncould not go to step forward: and when he thought to have turned his\r\nhorse round and go back the way he came, he heard a loud laugh ringing\r\nround him, and found that the path was closed behind him, so that he was\r\nshut in all round. He next tried to get off his horse and make his way\r\non foot, but again the laugh rang in his ears, and he found himself\r\nunable to move a step, and thus he was forced to abide spellbound.\r\n\r\nMeantime the old king was lingering on in daily hope of his son\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nreturn, till at last the second son said, \xe2\x80\x98Father, I will go in search\r\nof the Water of Life.\xe2\x80\x99 For he thought to himself, \xe2\x80\x98My brother is surely\r\ndead, and the kingdom will fall to me if I find the water.\xe2\x80\x99 The king was\r\nat first very unwilling to let him go, but at last yielded to his wish.\r\nSo he set out and followed the same road which his brother had done,\r\nand met with the same elf, who stopped him at the same spot in the\r\nmountains, saying, as before, \xe2\x80\x98Prince, prince, whither so fast?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Mind\r\nyour own affairs, busybody!\xe2\x80\x99 said the prince scornfully, and rode on.\r\n\r\nBut the dwarf put the same spell upon him as he put on his elder\r\nbrother, and he, too, was at last obliged to take up his abode in the\r\nheart of the mountains. Thus it is with proud silly people, who think\r\nthemselves above everyone else, and are too proud to ask or take advice.\r\n\r\nWhen the second prince had thus been gone a long time, the youngest son\r\nsaid he would go and search for the Water of Life, and trusted he should\r\nsoon be able to make his father well again. So he set out, and the dwarf\r\nmet him too at the same spot in the valley, among the mountains, and\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x98Prince, whither so fast?\xe2\x80\x99 And the prince said, \xe2\x80\x98I am going in\r\nsearch of the Water of Life, because my father is ill, and like to die:\r\ncan you help me? Pray be kind, and aid me if you can!\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Do you know\r\nwhere it is to be found?\xe2\x80\x99 asked the dwarf. \xe2\x80\x98No,\xe2\x80\x99 said the prince, \xe2\x80\x98I do\r\nnot. Pray tell me if you know.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Then as you have spoken to me kindly,\r\nand are wise enough to seek for advice, I will tell you how and where to\r\ngo. The water you seek springs from a well in an enchanted castle; and,\r\nthat you may be able to reach it in safety, I will give you an iron wand\r\nand two little loaves of bread; strike the iron door of the castle three\r\ntimes with the wand, and it will open: two hungry lions will be lying\r\ndown inside gaping for their prey, but if you throw them the bread they\r\nwill let you pass; then hasten on to the well, and take some of the\r\nWater of Life before the clock strikes twelve; for if you tarry longer\r\nthe door will shut upon you for ever.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThen the prince thanked his little friend with the scarlet cloak for his\r\nfriendly aid, and took the wand and the bread, and went travelling on\r\nand on, over sea and over land, till he came to his journey\xe2\x80\x99s end, and\r\nfound everything to be as the dwarf had told him. The door flew open at\r\nthe third stroke of the wand, and when the lions were quieted he went on\r\nthrough the castle and came at length to a beautiful hall. Around it he\r\nsaw several knights sitting in a trance; then he pulled off their rings\r\nand put them on his own fingers. In another room he saw on a table a\r\nsword and a loaf of bread, which he also took. Further on he came to a\r\nroom where a beautiful young lady sat upon a couch; and she welcomed him\r\njoyfully, and said, if he would set her free from the spell that bound\r\nher, the kingdom should be his, if he would come back in a year and\r\nmarry her. Then she told him that the well that held the Water of Life\r\nwas in the palace gardens; and bade him make haste, and draw what he\r\nwanted before the clock struck twelve.\r\n\r\nHe walked on; and as he walked through beautiful gardens he came to a\r\ndelightful shady spot in which stood a couch; and he thought to himself,\r\nas he felt tired, that he would rest himself for a while, and gaze on\r\nthe lovely scenes around him. So he laid himself down, and sleep\r\nfell upon him unawares, so that he did not wake up till the clock was\r\nstriking a quarter to twelve. Then he sprang from the couch dreadfully\r\nfrightened, ran to the well, filled a cup that was standing by him full\r\nof water, and hastened to get away in time. Just as he was going out of\r\nthe iron door it struck twelve, and the door fell so quickly upon him\r\nthat it snapped off a piece of his heel.\r\n\r\nWhen he found himself safe, he was overjoyed to think that he had got\r\nthe Water of Life; and as he was going on his way homewards, he passed\r\nby the little dwarf, who, when he saw the sword and the loaf, said, \xe2\x80\x98You\r\nhave made a noble prize; with the sword you can at a blow slay whole\r\narmies, and the bread will never fail you.\xe2\x80\x99 Then the prince thought\r\nto himself, \xe2\x80\x98I cannot go home to my father without my brothers\xe2\x80\x99; so he\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x98My dear friend, cannot you tell me where my two brothers are, who\r\nset out in search of the Water of Life before me, and never came back?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have shut them up by a charm between two mountains,\xe2\x80\x99 said the dwarf,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98because they were proud and ill-behaved, and scorned to ask advice.\xe2\x80\x99\r\nThe prince begged so hard for his brothers, that the dwarf at last set\r\nthem free, though unwillingly, saying, \xe2\x80\x98Beware of them, for they have\r\nbad hearts.\xe2\x80\x99 Their brother, however, was greatly rejoiced to see them,\r\nand told them all that had happened to him; how he had found the Water\r\nof Life, and had taken a cup full of it; and how he had set a beautiful\r\nprincess free from a spell that bound her; and how she had engaged to\r\nwait a whole year, and then to marry him, and to give him the kingdom.\r\n\r\nThen they all three rode on together, and on their way home came to a\r\ncountry that was laid waste by war and a dreadful famine, so that it was\r\nfeared all must die for want. But the prince gave the king of the land\r\nthe bread, and all his kingdom ate of it. And he lent the king the\r\nwonderful sword, and he slew the enemy\xe2\x80\x99s army with it; and thus the\r\nkingdom was once more in peace and plenty. In the same manner he\r\nbefriended two other countries through which they passed on their way.\r\n\r\nWhen they came to the sea, they got into a ship and during their voyage\r\nthe two eldest said to themselves, \xe2\x80\x98Our brother has got the water which\r\nwe could not find, therefore our father will forsake us and give him the\r\nkingdom, which is our right\xe2\x80\x99; so they were full of envy and revenge, and\r\nagreed together how they could ruin him. Then they waited till he was\r\nfast asleep, and poured the Water of Life out of the cup, and took it\r\nfor themselves, giving him bitter sea-water instead.\r\n\r\nWhen they came to their journey\xe2\x80\x99s end, the youngest son brought his cup\r\nto the sick king, that he might drink and be healed. Scarcely, however,\r\nhad he tasted the bitter sea-water when he became worse even than he was\r\nbefore; and then both the elder sons came in, and blamed the youngest\r\nfor what they had done; and said that he wanted to poison their father,\r\nbut that they had found the Water of Life, and had brought it with them.\r\nHe no sooner began to drink of what they brought him, than he felt his\r\nsickness leave him, and was as strong and well as in his younger days.\r\nThen they went to their brother, and laughed at him, and said, \xe2\x80\x98Well,\r\nbrother, you found the Water of Life, did you? You have had the trouble\r\nand we shall have the reward. Pray, with all your cleverness, why did\r\nnot you manage to keep your eyes open? Next year one of us will take\r\naway your beautiful princess, if you do not take care. You had better\r\nsay nothing about this to our father, for he does not believe a word you\r\nsay; and if you tell tales, you shall lose your life into the bargain:\r\nbut be quiet, and we will let you off.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe old king was still very angry with his youngest son, and thought\r\nthat he really meant to have taken away his life; so he called his court\r\ntogether, and asked what should be done, and all agreed that he ought to\r\nbe put to death. The prince knew nothing of what was going on, till one\r\nday, when the king\xe2\x80\x99s chief huntsmen went a-hunting with him, and they\r\nwere alone in the wood together, the huntsman looked so sorrowful that\r\nthe prince said, \xe2\x80\x98My friend, what is the matter with you?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98I cannot and\r\ndare not tell you,\xe2\x80\x99 said he. But the prince begged very hard, and said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Only tell me what it is, and do not think I shall be angry, for I will\r\nforgive you.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Alas!\xe2\x80\x99 said the huntsman; \xe2\x80\x98the king has ordered me to\r\nshoot you.\xe2\x80\x99 The prince started at this, and said, \xe2\x80\x98Let me live, and I\r\nwill change dresses with you; you shall take my royal coat to show to my\r\nfather, and do you give me your shabby one.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98With all my heart,\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nthe huntsman; \xe2\x80\x98I am sure I shall be glad to save you, for I could not\r\nhave shot you.\xe2\x80\x99 Then he took the prince\xe2\x80\x99s coat, and gave him the shabby\r\none, and went away through the wood.\r\n\r\nSome time after, three grand embassies came to the old king\xe2\x80\x99s court,\r\nwith rich gifts of gold and precious stones for his youngest son; now\r\nall these were sent from the three kings to whom he had lent his sword\r\nand loaf of bread, in order to rid them of their enemy and feed their\r\npeople. This touched the old king\xe2\x80\x99s heart, and he thought his son might\r\nstill be guiltless, and said to his court, \xe2\x80\x98O that my son were still\r\nalive! how it grieves me that I had him killed!\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98He is still alive,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsaid the huntsman; \xe2\x80\x98and I am glad that I had pity on him, but let him\r\ngo in peace, and brought home his royal coat.\xe2\x80\x99 At this the king was\r\noverwhelmed with joy, and made it known throughout all his kingdom, that\r\nif his son would come back to his court he would forgive him.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the princess was eagerly waiting till her deliverer should\r\ncome back; and had a road made leading up to her palace all of shining\r\ngold; and told her courtiers that whoever came on horseback, and rode\r\nstraight up to the gate upon it, was her true lover; and that they must\r\nlet him in: but whoever rode on one side of it, they must be sure was\r\nnot the right one; and that they must send him away at once.\r\n\r\nThe time soon came, when the eldest brother thought that he would make\r\nhaste to go to the princess, and say that he was the one who had set\r\nher free, and that he should have her for his wife, and the kingdom with\r\nher. As he came before the palace and saw the golden road, he stopped to\r\nlook at it, and he thought to himself, \xe2\x80\x98It is a pity to ride upon this\r\nbeautiful road\xe2\x80\x99; so he turned aside and rode on the right-hand side of\r\nit. But when he came to the gate, the guards, who had seen the road\r\nhe took, said to him, he could not be what he said he was, and must go\r\nabout his business.\r\n\r\nThe second prince set out soon afterwards on the same errand; and when\r\nhe came to the golden road, and his horse had set one foot upon it,\r\nhe stopped to look at it, and thought it very beautiful, and said to\r\nhimself, \xe2\x80\x98What a pity it is that anything should tread here!\xe2\x80\x99 Then he\r\ntoo turned aside and rode on the left side of it. But when he came to\r\nthe gate the guards said he was not the true prince, and that he too\r\nmust go away about his business; and away he went.\r\n\r\nNow when the full year was come round, the third brother left the forest\r\nin which he had lain hid for fear of his father\xe2\x80\x99s anger, and set out in\r\nsearch of his betrothed bride. So he journeyed on, thinking of her all\r\nthe way, and rode so quickly that he did not even see what the road was\r\nmade of, but went with his horse straight over it; and as he came to the\r\ngate it flew open, and the princess welcomed him with joy, and said\r\nhe was her deliverer, and should now be her husband and lord of the\r\nkingdom. When the first joy at their meeting was over, the princess told\r\nhim she had heard of his father having forgiven him, and of his wish to\r\nhave him home again: so, before his wedding with the princess, he went\r\nto visit his father, taking her with him. Then he told him everything;\r\nhow his brothers had cheated and robbed him, and yet that he had borne\r\nall those wrongs for the love of his father. And the old king was very\r\nangry, and wanted to punish his wicked sons; but they made their escape,\r\nand got into a ship and sailed away over the wide sea, and where they\r\nwent to nobody knew and nobody cared.\r\n\r\nAnd now the old king gathered together his court, and asked all his\r\nkingdom to come and celebrate the wedding of his son and the princess.\r\nAnd young and old, noble and squire, gentle and simple, came at once\r\non the summons; and among the rest came the friendly dwarf, with the\r\nsugarloaf hat, and a new scarlet cloak.\r\n\r\n  And the wedding was held, and the merry bells run.\r\n  And all the good people they danced and they sung,\r\n  And feasted and frolick\xe2\x80\x99d I can\xe2\x80\x99t tell how long.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TWELVE HUNTSMEN\r\n\r\nThere was once a king\xe2\x80\x99s son who had a bride whom he loved very much. And\r\nwhen he was sitting beside her and very happy, news came that his father\r\nlay sick unto death, and desired to see him once again before his end.\r\nThen he said to his beloved: \xe2\x80\x98I must now go and leave you, I give you\r\na ring as a remembrance of me. When I am king, I will return and fetch\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x99 So he rode away, and when he reached his father, the latter was\r\ndangerously ill, and near his death. He said to him: \xe2\x80\x98Dear son, I wished\r\nto see you once again before my end, promise me to marry as I wish,\xe2\x80\x99 and\r\nhe named a certain king\xe2\x80\x99s daughter who was to be his wife. The son was\r\nin such trouble that he did not think what he was doing, and said: \xe2\x80\x98Yes,\r\ndear father, your will shall be done,\xe2\x80\x99 and thereupon the king shut his\r\neyes, and died.\r\n\r\nWhen therefore the son had been proclaimed king, and the time of\r\nmourning was over, he was forced to keep the promise which he had given\r\nhis father, and caused the king\xe2\x80\x99s daughter to be asked in marriage, and\r\nshe was promised to him. His first betrothed heard of this, and fretted\r\nso much about his faithfulness that she nearly died. Then her father\r\nsaid to her: \xe2\x80\x98Dearest child, why are you so sad? You shall have\r\nwhatsoever you will.\xe2\x80\x99 She thought for a moment and said: \xe2\x80\x98Dear father,\r\nI wish for eleven girls exactly like myself in face, figure, and size.\xe2\x80\x99\r\nThe father said: \xe2\x80\x98If it be possible, your desire shall be fulfilled,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nand he caused a search to be made in his whole kingdom, until eleven\r\nyoung maidens were found who exactly resembled his daughter in face,\r\nfigure, and size.\r\n\r\nWhen they came to the king\xe2\x80\x99s daughter, she had twelve suits of\r\nhuntsmen\xe2\x80\x99s clothes made, all alike, and the eleven maidens had to put\r\non the huntsmen\xe2\x80\x99s clothes, and she herself put on the twelfth suit.\r\nThereupon she took her leave of her father, and rode away with them,\r\nand rode to the court of her former betrothed, whom she loved so dearly.\r\nThen she asked if he required any huntsmen, and if he would take all of\r\nthem into his service. The king looked at her and did not know her, but\r\nas they were such handsome fellows, he said: \xe2\x80\x98Yes,\xe2\x80\x99 and that he would\r\nwillingly take them, and now they were the king\xe2\x80\x99s twelve huntsmen.\r\n\r\nThe king, however, had a lion which was a wondrous animal, for he knew\r\nall concealed and secret things. It came to pass that one evening he\r\nsaid to the king: \xe2\x80\x98You think you have twelve huntsmen?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Yes,\xe2\x80\x99 said the\r\nking, \xe2\x80\x98they are twelve huntsmen.\xe2\x80\x99 The lion continued: \xe2\x80\x98You are mistaken,\r\nthey are twelve girls.\xe2\x80\x99 The king said: \xe2\x80\x98That cannot be true! How\r\nwill you prove that to me?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Oh, just let some peas be strewn in the\r\nante-chamber,\xe2\x80\x99 answered the lion, \xe2\x80\x98and then you will soon see. Men have\r\na firm step, and when they walk over peas none of them stir, but girls\r\ntrip and skip, and drag their feet, and the peas roll about.\xe2\x80\x99 The king\r\nwas well pleased with the counsel, and caused the peas to be strewn.\r\n\r\nThere was, however, a servant of the king\xe2\x80\x99s who favoured the huntsmen,\r\nand when he heard that they were going to be put to this test he went to\r\nthem and repeated everything, and said: \xe2\x80\x98The lion wants to make the king\r\nbelieve that you are girls.\xe2\x80\x99 Then the king\xe2\x80\x99s daughter thanked him, and\r\nsaid to her maidens: \xe2\x80\x98Show some strength, and step firmly on the peas.\xe2\x80\x99\r\nSo next morning when the king had the twelve huntsmen called before\r\nhim, and they came into the ante-chamber where the peas were lying, they\r\nstepped so firmly on them, and had such a strong, sure walk, that not\r\none of the peas either rolled or stirred. Then they went away again,\r\nand the king said to the lion: \xe2\x80\x98You have lied to me, they walk just like\r\nmen.\xe2\x80\x99 The lion said: \xe2\x80\x98They have been informed that they were going to\r\nbe put to the test, and have assumed some strength. Just let twelve\r\nspinning-wheels be brought into the ante-chamber, and they will go to\r\nthem and be pleased with them, and that is what no man would do.\xe2\x80\x99\r\nThe king liked the advice, and had the spinning-wheels placed in the\r\nante-chamber.\r\n\r\nBut the servant, who was well disposed to the huntsmen, went to them,\r\nand disclosed the project. So when they were alone the king\xe2\x80\x99s daughter\r\nsaid to her eleven girls: \xe2\x80\x98Show some constraint, and do not look round\r\nat the spinning-wheels.\xe2\x80\x99 And next morning when the king had his twelve\r\nhuntsmen summoned, they went through the ante-chamber, and never once\r\nlooked at the spinning-wheels. Then the king again said to the lion:\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You have deceived me, they are men, for they have not looked at the\r\nspinning-wheels.\xe2\x80\x99 The lion replied: \xe2\x80\x98They have restrained themselves.\xe2\x80\x99\r\nThe king, however, would no longer believe the lion.\r\n\r\nThe twelve huntsmen always followed the king to the chase, and his\r\nliking for them continually increased. Now it came to pass that\r\nonce when they were out hunting, news came that the king\xe2\x80\x99s bride was\r\napproaching. When the true bride heard that, it hurt her so much that\r\nher heart was almost broken, and she fell fainting to the ground. The\r\nking thought something had happened to his dear huntsman, ran up to him,\r\nwanted to help him, and drew his glove off. Then he saw the ring which\r\nhe had given to his first bride, and when he looked in her face he\r\nrecognized her. Then his heart was so touched that he kissed her, and\r\nwhen she opened her eyes he said: \xe2\x80\x98You are mine, and I am yours, and\r\nno one in the world can alter that.\xe2\x80\x99 He sent a messenger to the other\r\nbride, and entreated her to return to her own kingdom, for he had a wife\r\nalready, and someone who had just found an old key did not require a new\r\none. Thereupon the wedding was celebrated, and the lion was again taken\r\ninto favour, because, after all, he had told the truth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE KING OF THE GOLDEN MOUNTAIN\r\n\r\nThere was once a merchant who had only one child, a son, that was very\r\nyoung, and barely able to run alone. He had two richly laden ships then\r\nmaking a voyage upon the seas, in which he had embarked all his wealth,\r\nin the hope of making great gains, when the news came that both were\r\nlost. Thus from being a rich man he became all at once so very poor that\r\nnothing was left to him but one small plot of land; and there he often\r\nwent in an evening to take his walk, and ease his mind of a little of\r\nhis trouble.\r\n\r\nOne day, as he was roaming along in a brown study, thinking with no\r\ngreat comfort on what he had been and what he now was, and was like\r\nto be, all on a sudden there stood before him a little, rough-looking,\r\nblack dwarf. \xe2\x80\x98Prithee, friend, why so sorrowful?\xe2\x80\x99 said he to the\r\nmerchant; \xe2\x80\x98what is it you take so deeply to heart?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98If you would do me\r\nany good I would willingly tell you,\xe2\x80\x99 said the merchant. \xe2\x80\x98Who knows but\r\nI may?\xe2\x80\x99 said the little man: \xe2\x80\x98tell me what ails you, and perhaps you\r\nwill find I may be of some use.\xe2\x80\x99 Then the merchant told him how all his\r\nwealth was gone to the bottom of the sea, and how he had nothing left\r\nbut that little plot of land. \xe2\x80\x98Oh, trouble not yourself about that,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsaid the dwarf; \xe2\x80\x98only undertake to bring me here, twelve years hence,\r\nwhatever meets you first on your going home, and I will give you as much\r\nas you please.\xe2\x80\x99 The merchant thought this was no great thing to ask;\r\nthat it would most likely be his dog or his cat, or something of that\r\nsort, but forgot his little boy Heinel; so he agreed to the bargain, and\r\nsigned and sealed the bond to do what was asked of him.\r\n\r\nBut as he drew near home, his little boy was so glad to see him that he\r\ncrept behind him, and laid fast hold of his legs, and looked up in\r\nhis face and laughed. Then the father started, trembling with fear and\r\nhorror, and saw what it was that he had bound himself to do; but as no\r\ngold was come, he made himself easy by thinking that it was only a joke\r\nthat the dwarf was playing him, and that, at any rate, when the money\r\ncame, he should see the bearer, and would not take it in.\r\n\r\nAbout a month afterwards he went upstairs into a lumber-room to look\r\nfor some old iron, that he might sell it and raise a little money; and\r\nthere, instead of his iron, he saw a large pile of gold lying on the\r\nfloor. At the sight of this he was overjoyed, and forgetting all about\r\nhis son, went into trade again, and became a richer merchant than\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nMeantime little Heinel grew up, and as the end of the twelve years drew\r\nnear the merchant began to call to mind his bond, and became very sad\r\nand thoughtful; so that care and sorrow were written upon his face. The\r\nboy one day asked what was the matter, but his father would not tell for\r\nsome time; at last, however, he said that he had, without knowing it,\r\nsold him for gold to a little, ugly-looking, black dwarf, and that the\r\ntwelve years were coming round when he must keep his word. Then Heinel\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x98Father, give yourself very little trouble about that; I shall be\r\ntoo much for the little man.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWhen the time came, the father and son went out together to the place\r\nagreed upon: and the son drew a circle on the ground, and set himself\r\nand his father in the middle of it. The little black dwarf soon came,\r\nand walked round and round about the circle, but could not find any way\r\nto get into it, and he either could not, or dared not, jump over it. At\r\nlast the boy said to him. \xe2\x80\x98Have you anything to say to us, my friend, or\r\nwhat do you want?\xe2\x80\x99 Now Heinel had found a friend in a good fairy, that\r\nwas fond of him, and had told him what to do; for this fairy knew what\r\ngood luck was in store for him. \xe2\x80\x98Have you brought me what you said you\r\nwould?\xe2\x80\x99 said the dwarf to the merchant. The old man held his tongue, but\r\nHeinel said again, \xe2\x80\x98What do you want here?\xe2\x80\x99 The dwarf said, \xe2\x80\x98I come to\r\ntalk with your father, not with you.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98You have cheated and taken in my\r\nfather,\xe2\x80\x99 said the son; \xe2\x80\x98pray give him up his bond at once.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Fair and\r\nsoftly,\xe2\x80\x99 said the little old man; \xe2\x80\x98right is right; I have paid my money,\r\nand your father has had it, and spent it; so be so good as to let me\r\nhave what I paid it for.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98You must have my consent to that first,\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nHeinel, \xe2\x80\x98so please to step in here, and let us talk it over.\xe2\x80\x99 The old\r\nman grinned, and showed his teeth, as if he should have been very glad\r\nto get into the circle if he could. Then at last, after a long talk,\r\nthey came to terms. Heinel agreed that his father must give him up, and\r\nthat so far the dwarf should have his way: but, on the other hand, the\r\nfairy had told Heinel what fortune was in store for him, if he followed\r\nhis own course; and he did not choose to be given up to his hump-backed\r\nfriend, who seemed so anxious for his company.\r\n\r\nSo, to make a sort of drawn battle of the matter, it was settled that\r\nHeinel should be put into an open boat, that lay on the sea-shore hard\r\nby; that the father should push him off with his own hand, and that he\r\nshould thus be set adrift, and left to the bad or good luck of wind and\r\nweather. Then he took leave of his father, and set himself in the boat,\r\nbut before it got far off a wave struck it, and it fell with one side\r\nlow in the water, so the merchant thought that poor Heinel was lost, and\r\nwent home very sorrowful, while the dwarf went his way, thinking that at\r\nany rate he had had his revenge.\r\n\r\nThe boat, however, did not sink, for the good fairy took care of her\r\nfriend, and soon raised the boat up again, and it went safely on. The\r\nyoung man sat safe within, till at length it ran ashore upon an unknown\r\nland. As he jumped upon the shore he saw before him a beautiful castle\r\nbut empty and dreary within, for it was enchanted. \xe2\x80\x98Here,\xe2\x80\x99 said he to\r\nhimself, \xe2\x80\x98must I find the prize the good fairy told me of.\xe2\x80\x99 So he once\r\nmore searched the whole palace through, till at last he found a white\r\nsnake, lying coiled up on a cushion in one of the chambers.\r\n\r\nNow the white snake was an enchanted princess; and she was very glad\r\nto see him, and said, \xe2\x80\x98Are you at last come to set me free? Twelve\r\nlong years have I waited here for the fairy to bring you hither as she\r\npromised, for you alone can save me. This night twelve men will come:\r\ntheir faces will be black, and they will be dressed in chain armour.\r\nThey will ask what you do here, but give no answer; and let them do\r\nwhat they will--beat, whip, pinch, prick, or torment you--bear all; only\r\nspeak not a word, and at twelve o\xe2\x80\x99clock they must go away. The second\r\nnight twelve others will come: and the third night twenty-four, who\r\nwill even cut off your head; but at the twelfth hour of that night their\r\npower is gone, and I shall be free, and will come and bring you the\r\nWater of Life, and will wash you with it, and bring you back to life\r\nand health.\xe2\x80\x99 And all came to pass as she had said; Heinel bore all, and\r\nspoke not a word; and the third night the princess came, and fell on his\r\nneck and kissed him. Joy and gladness burst forth throughout the castle,\r\nthe wedding was celebrated, and he was crowned king of the Golden\r\nMountain.\r\n\r\nThey lived together very happily, and the queen had a son. And thus\r\neight years had passed over their heads, when the king thought of his\r\nfather; and he began to long to see him once again. But the queen was\r\nagainst his going, and said, \xe2\x80\x98I know well that misfortunes will come\r\nupon us if you go.\xe2\x80\x99 However, he gave her no rest till she agreed. At his\r\ngoing away she gave him a wishing-ring, and said, \xe2\x80\x98Take this ring, and\r\nput it on your finger; whatever you wish it will bring you; only promise\r\nnever to make use of it to bring me hence to your father\xe2\x80\x99s house.\xe2\x80\x99 Then\r\nhe said he would do what she asked, and put the ring on his finger, and\r\nwished himself near the town where his father lived.\r\n\r\nHeinel found himself at the gates in a moment; but the guards would\r\nnot let him go in, because he was so strangely clad. So he went up to a\r\nneighbouring hill, where a shepherd dwelt, and borrowed his old frock,\r\nand thus passed unknown into the town. When he came to his father\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhouse, he said he was his son; but the merchant would not believe him,\r\nand said he had had but one son, his poor Heinel, who he knew was long\r\nsince dead: and as he was only dressed like a poor shepherd, he would\r\nnot even give him anything to eat. The king, however, still vowed that\r\nhe was his son, and said, \xe2\x80\x98Is there no mark by which you would know me\r\nif I am really your son?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Yes,\xe2\x80\x99 said his mother, \xe2\x80\x98our Heinel had a mark\r\nlike a raspberry on his right arm.\xe2\x80\x99 Then he showed them the mark, and\r\nthey knew that what he had said was true.\r\n\r\nHe next told them how he was king of the Golden Mountain, and was\r\nmarried to a princess, and had a son seven years old. But the merchant\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x98that can never be true; he must be a fine king truly who travels\r\nabout in a shepherd\xe2\x80\x99s frock!\xe2\x80\x99 At this the son was vexed; and forgetting\r\nhis word, turned his ring, and wished for his queen and son. In an\r\ninstant they stood before him; but the queen wept, and said he had\r\nbroken his word, and bad luck would follow. He did all he could to\r\nsoothe her, and she at last seemed to be appeased; but she was not so in\r\ntruth, and was only thinking how she should punish him.\r\n\r\nOne day he took her to walk with him out of the town, and showed her\r\nthe spot where the boat was set adrift upon the wide waters. Then he sat\r\nhimself down, and said, \xe2\x80\x98I am very much tired; sit by me, I will rest my\r\nhead in your lap, and sleep a while.\xe2\x80\x99 As soon as he had fallen asleep,\r\nhowever, she drew the ring from his finger, and crept softly away, and\r\nwished herself and her son at home in their kingdom. And when he awoke\r\nhe found himself alone, and saw that the ring was gone from his finger.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I can never go back to my father\xe2\x80\x99s house,\xe2\x80\x99 said he; \xe2\x80\x98they would say I\r\nam a sorcerer: I will journey forth into the world, till I come again to\r\nmy kingdom.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSo saying he set out and travelled till he came to a hill, where three\r\ngiants were sharing their father\xe2\x80\x99s goods; and as they saw him pass they\r\ncried out and said, \xe2\x80\x98Little men have sharp wits; he shall part the goods\r\nbetween us.\xe2\x80\x99 Now there was a sword that cut off an enemy\xe2\x80\x99s head whenever\r\nthe wearer gave the words, \xe2\x80\x98Heads off!\xe2\x80\x99; a cloak that made the owner\r\ninvisible, or gave him any form he pleased; and a pair of boots that\r\ncarried the wearer wherever he wished. Heinel said they must first let\r\nhim try these wonderful things, then he might know how to set a value\r\nupon them. Then they gave him the cloak, and he wished himself a fly,\r\nand in a moment he was a fly. \xe2\x80\x98The cloak is very well,\xe2\x80\x99 said he: \xe2\x80\x98now\r\ngive me the sword.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98No,\xe2\x80\x99 said they; \xe2\x80\x98not unless you undertake not to\r\nsay, \xe2\x80\x9cHeads off!\xe2\x80\x9d for if you do we are all dead men.\xe2\x80\x99 So they gave it\r\nhim, charging him to try it on a tree. He next asked for the boots also;\r\nand the moment he had all three in his power, he wished himself at\r\nthe Golden Mountain; and there he was at once. So the giants were left\r\nbehind with no goods to share or quarrel about.\r\n\r\nAs Heinel came near his castle he heard the sound of merry music; and\r\nthe people around told him that his queen was about to marry another\r\nhusband. Then he threw his cloak around him, and passed through the\r\ncastle hall, and placed himself by the side of the queen, where no one\r\nsaw him. But when anything to eat was put upon her plate, he took it\r\naway and ate it himself; and when a glass of wine was handed to her, he\r\ntook it and drank it; and thus, though they kept on giving her meat and\r\ndrink, her plate and cup were always empty.\r\n\r\nUpon this, fear and remorse came over her, and she went into her chamber\r\nalone, and sat there weeping; and he followed her there. \xe2\x80\x98Alas!\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nshe to herself, \xe2\x80\x98was I not once set free? Why then does this enchantment\r\nstill seem to bind me?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98False and fickle one!\xe2\x80\x99 said he. \xe2\x80\x98One indeed came who set thee free, and\r\nhe is now near thee again; but how have you used him? Ought he to\r\nhave had such treatment from thee?\xe2\x80\x99 Then he went out and sent away the\r\ncompany, and said the wedding was at an end, for that he was come back\r\nto the kingdom. But the princes, peers, and great men mocked at him.\r\nHowever, he would enter into no parley with them, but only asked them\r\nif they would go in peace or not. Then they turned upon him and tried\r\nto seize him; but he drew his sword. \xe2\x80\x98Heads Off!\xe2\x80\x99 cried he; and with the\r\nword the traitors\xe2\x80\x99 heads fell before him, and Heinel was once more king\r\nof the Golden Mountain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDOCTOR KNOWALL\r\n\r\nThere was once upon a time a poor peasant called Crabb, who drove with\r\ntwo oxen a load of wood to the town, and sold it to a doctor for two\r\ntalers. When the money was being counted out to him, it so happened that\r\nthe doctor was sitting at table, and when the peasant saw how well he\r\nate and drank, his heart desired what he saw, and would willingly\r\nhave been a doctor too. So he remained standing a while, and at length\r\ninquired if he too could not be a doctor. \xe2\x80\x98Oh, yes,\xe2\x80\x99 said the doctor,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98that is soon managed.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98What must I do?\xe2\x80\x99 asked the peasant. \xe2\x80\x98In the\r\nfirst place buy yourself an A B C book of the kind which has a cock on\r\nthe frontispiece; in the second, turn your cart and your two oxen into\r\nmoney, and get yourself some clothes, and whatsoever else pertains to\r\nmedicine; thirdly, have a sign painted for yourself with the words: \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nam Doctor Knowall,\xe2\x80\x9d and have that nailed up above your house-door.\xe2\x80\x99 The\r\npeasant did everything that he had been told to do. When he had doctored\r\npeople awhile, but not long, a rich and great lord had some money\r\nstolen. Then he was told about Doctor Knowall who lived in such and such\r\na village, and must know what had become of the money. So the lord had\r\nthe horses harnessed to his carriage, drove out to the village, and\r\nasked Crabb if he were Doctor Knowall. Yes, he was, he said. Then he was\r\nto go with him and bring back the stolen money. \xe2\x80\x98Oh, yes, but Grete, my\r\nwife, must go too.\xe2\x80\x99 The lord was willing, and let both of them have a\r\nseat in the carriage, and they all drove away together. When they came\r\nto the nobleman\xe2\x80\x99s castle, the table was spread, and Crabb was told to\r\nsit down and eat. \xe2\x80\x98Yes, but my wife, Grete, too,\xe2\x80\x99 said he, and he seated\r\nhimself with her at the table. And when the first servant came with a\r\ndish of delicate fare, the peasant nudged his wife, and said: \xe2\x80\x98Grete,\r\nthat was the first,\xe2\x80\x99 meaning that was the servant who brought the first\r\ndish. The servant, however, thought he intended by that to say: \xe2\x80\x98That is\r\nthe first thief,\xe2\x80\x99 and as he actually was so, he was terrified, and said\r\nto his comrade outside: \xe2\x80\x98The doctor knows all: we shall fare ill, he\r\nsaid I was the first.\xe2\x80\x99 The second did not want to go in at all, but was\r\nforced. So when he went in with his dish, the peasant nudged his wife,\r\nand said: \xe2\x80\x98Grete, that is the second.\xe2\x80\x99 This servant was equally alarmed,\r\nand he got out as fast as he could. The third fared no better, for the\r\npeasant again said: \xe2\x80\x98Grete, that is the third.\xe2\x80\x99 The fourth had to carry\r\nin a dish that was covered, and the lord told the doctor that he was to\r\nshow his skill, and guess what was beneath the cover. Actually, there\r\nwere crabs. The doctor looked at the dish, had no idea what to say, and\r\ncried: \xe2\x80\x98Ah, poor Crabb.\xe2\x80\x99 When the lord heard that, he cried: \xe2\x80\x98There! he\r\nknows it; he must also know who has the money!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nOn this the servants looked terribly uneasy, and made a sign to the\r\ndoctor that they wished him to step outside for a moment. When therefore\r\nhe went out, all four of them confessed to him that they had stolen\r\nthe money, and said that they would willingly restore it and give him a\r\nheavy sum into the bargain, if he would not denounce them, for if he\r\ndid they would be hanged. They led him to the spot where the money was\r\nconcealed. With this the doctor was satisfied, and returned to the hall,\r\nsat down to the table, and said: \xe2\x80\x98My lord, now will I search in my book\r\nwhere the gold is hidden.\xe2\x80\x99 The fifth servant, however, crept into the\r\nstove to hear if the doctor knew still more. But the doctor sat still\r\nand opened his A B C book, turned the pages backwards and forwards, and\r\nlooked for the cock. As he could not find it immediately he said: \xe2\x80\x98I\r\nknow you are there, so you had better come out!\xe2\x80\x99 Then the fellow in the\r\nstove thought that the doctor meant him, and full of terror, sprang out,\r\ncrying: \xe2\x80\x98That man knows everything!\xe2\x80\x99 Then Doctor Knowall showed the lord\r\nwhere the money was, but did not say who had stolen it, and received\r\nfrom both sides much money in reward, and became a renowned man.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SEVEN RAVENS\r\n\r\nThere was once a man who had seven sons, and last of all one daughter.\r\nAlthough the little girl was very pretty, she was so weak and small that\r\nthey thought she could not live; but they said she should at once be\r\nchristened.\r\n\r\nSo the father sent one of his sons in haste to the spring to get some\r\nwater, but the other six ran with him. Each wanted to be first at\r\ndrawing the water, and so they were in such a hurry that all let their\r\npitchers fall into the well, and they stood very foolishly looking at\r\none another, and did not know what to do, for none dared go home. In the\r\nmeantime the father was uneasy, and could not tell what made the\r\nyoung men stay so long. \xe2\x80\x98Surely,\xe2\x80\x99 said he, \xe2\x80\x98the whole seven must have\r\nforgotten themselves over some game of play\xe2\x80\x99; and when he had waited\r\nstill longer and they yet did not come, he flew into a rage and wished\r\nthem all turned into ravens. Scarcely had he spoken these words when he\r\nheard a croaking over his head, and looked up and saw seven ravens as\r\nblack as coal flying round and round. Sorry as he was to see his wish\r\nso fulfilled, he did not know how what was done could be undone, and\r\ncomforted himself as well as he could for the loss of his seven sons\r\nwith his dear little daughter, who soon became stronger and every day\r\nmore beautiful.\r\n\r\nFor a long time she did not know that she had ever had any brothers; for\r\nher father and mother took care not to speak of them before her: but one\r\nday by chance she heard the people about her speak of them. \xe2\x80\x98Yes,\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nthey, \xe2\x80\x98she is beautiful indeed, but still \xe2\x80\x98tis a pity that her brothers\r\nshould have been lost for her sake.\xe2\x80\x99 Then she was much grieved, and went\r\nto her father and mother, and asked if she had any brothers, and what\r\nhad become of them. So they dared no longer hide the truth from her, but\r\nsaid it was the will of Heaven, and that her birth was only the innocent\r\ncause of it; but the little girl mourned sadly about it every day, and\r\nthought herself bound to do all she could to bring her brothers back;\r\nand she had neither rest nor ease, till at length one day she stole\r\naway, and set out into the wide world to find her brothers, wherever\r\nthey might be, and free them, whatever it might cost her.\r\n\r\nShe took nothing with her but a little ring which her father and mother\r\nhad given her, a loaf of bread in case she should be hungry, a little\r\npitcher of water in case she should be thirsty, and a little stool\r\nto rest upon when she should be weary. Thus she went on and on, and\r\njourneyed till she came to the world\xe2\x80\x99s end; then she came to the sun,\r\nbut the sun looked much too hot and fiery; so she ran away quickly to\r\nthe moon, but the moon was cold and chilly, and said, \xe2\x80\x98I smell flesh\r\nand blood this way!\xe2\x80\x99 so she took herself away in a hurry and came to the\r\nstars, and the stars were friendly and kind to her, and each star sat\r\nupon his own little stool; but the morning star rose up and gave her a\r\nlittle piece of wood, and said, \xe2\x80\x98If you have not this little piece of\r\nwood, you cannot unlock the castle that stands on the glass-mountain,\r\nand there your brothers live.\xe2\x80\x99 The little girl took the piece of wood,\r\nrolled it up in a little cloth, and went on again until she came to the\r\nglass-mountain, and found the door shut. Then she felt for the little\r\npiece of wood; but when she unwrapped the cloth it was not there, and\r\nshe saw she had lost the gift of the good stars. What was to be done?\r\nShe wanted to save her brothers, and had no key of the castle of the\r\nglass-mountain; so this faithful little sister took a knife out of her\r\npocket and cut off her little finger, that was just the size of the\r\npiece of wood she had lost, and put it in the door and opened it.\r\n\r\nAs she went in, a little dwarf came up to her, and said, \xe2\x80\x98What are you\r\nseeking for?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98I seek for my brothers, the seven ravens,\xe2\x80\x99 answered she.\r\nThen the dwarf said, \xe2\x80\x98My masters are not at home; but if you will wait\r\ntill they come, pray step in.\xe2\x80\x99 Now the little dwarf was getting their\r\ndinner ready, and he brought their food upon seven little plates, and\r\ntheir drink in seven little glasses, and set them upon the table, and\r\nout of each little plate their sister ate a small piece, and out of each\r\nlittle glass she drank a small drop; but she let the ring that she had\r\nbrought with her fall into the last glass.\r\n\r\nOn a sudden she heard a fluttering and croaking in the air, and the\r\ndwarf said, \xe2\x80\x98Here come my masters.\xe2\x80\x99 When they came in, they wanted to\r\neat and drink, and looked for their little plates and glasses. Then said\r\none after the other,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Who has eaten from my little plate? And who has been drinking out of my\r\nlittle glass?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n \xe2\x80\x98Caw! Caw! well I ween\r\n  Mortal lips have this way been.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWhen the seventh came to the bottom of his glass, and found there the\r\nring, he looked at it, and knew that it was his father\xe2\x80\x99s and mother\xe2\x80\x99s,\r\nand said, \xe2\x80\x98O that our little sister would but come! then we should be\r\nfree.\xe2\x80\x99 When the little girl heard this (for she stood behind the door\r\nall the time and listened), she ran forward, and in an instant all\r\nthe ravens took their right form again; and all hugged and kissed each\r\nother, and went merrily home.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WEDDING OF MRS FOX\r\n\r\n\r\nFIRST STORY\r\n\r\nThere was once upon a time an old fox with nine tails, who believed that\r\nhis wife was not faithful to him, and wished to put her to the test. He\r\nstretched himself out under the bench, did not move a limb, and behaved\r\nas if he were stone dead. Mrs Fox went up to her room, shut herself in,\r\nand her maid, Miss Cat, sat by the fire, and did the cooking. When it\r\nbecame known that the old fox was dead, suitors presented themselves.\r\nThe maid heard someone standing at the house-door, knocking. She went\r\nand opened it, and it was a young fox, who said:\r\n\r\n \xe2\x80\x98What may you be about, Miss Cat?\r\n  Do you sleep or do you wake?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShe answered:\r\n\r\n \xe2\x80\x98I am not sleeping, I am waking,\r\n  Would you know what I am making?\r\n  I am boiling warm beer with butter,\r\n  Will you be my guest for supper?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, thank you, miss,\xe2\x80\x99 said the fox, \xe2\x80\x98what is Mrs Fox doing?\xe2\x80\x99 The maid\r\nreplied:\r\n\r\n \xe2\x80\x98She is sitting in her room,\r\n  Moaning in her gloom,\r\n  Weeping her little eyes quite red,\r\n  Because old Mr Fox is dead.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Do just tell her, miss, that a young fox is here, who would like to woo\r\nher.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Certainly, young sir.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n  The cat goes up the stairs trip, trap,\r\n  The door she knocks at tap, tap, tap,\r\n \xe2\x80\x98Mistress Fox, are you inside?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n \xe2\x80\x98Oh, yes, my little cat,\xe2\x80\x99 she cried.\r\n \xe2\x80\x98A wooer he stands at the door out there.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n \xe2\x80\x98What does he look like, my dear?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Has he nine as beautiful tails as the late Mr Fox?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Oh, no,\xe2\x80\x99 answered\r\nthe cat, \xe2\x80\x98he has only one.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Then I will not have him.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMiss Cat went downstairs and sent the wooer away. Soon afterwards there\r\nwas another knock, and another fox was at the door who wished to woo Mrs\r\nFox. He had two tails, but he did not fare better than the first. After\r\nthis still more came, each with one tail more than the other, but they\r\nwere all turned away, until at last one came who had nine tails, like\r\nold Mr Fox. When the widow heard that, she said joyfully to the cat:\r\n\r\n \xe2\x80\x98Now open the gates and doors all wide,\r\n  And carry old Mr Fox outside.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBut just as the wedding was going to be solemnized, old Mr Fox stirred\r\nunder the bench, and cudgelled all the rabble, and drove them and Mrs\r\nFox out of the house.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECOND STORY\r\n\r\nWhen old Mr Fox was dead, the wolf came as a suitor, and knocked at the\r\ndoor, and the cat who was servant to Mrs Fox, opened it for him. The\r\nwolf greeted her, and said:\r\n\r\n \xe2\x80\x98Good day, Mrs Cat of Kehrewit,\r\n  How comes it that alone you sit?\r\n  What are you making good?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe cat replied:\r\n\r\n \xe2\x80\x98In milk I\xe2\x80\x99m breaking bread so sweet,\r\n  Will you be my guest, and eat?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98No, thank you, Mrs Cat,\xe2\x80\x99 answered the wolf. \xe2\x80\x98Is Mrs Fox not at home?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe cat said:\r\n\r\n \xe2\x80\x98She sits upstairs in her room,\r\n  Bewailing her sorrowful doom,\r\n  Bewailing her trouble so sore,\r\n  For old Mr Fox is no more.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe wolf answered:\r\n\r\n \xe2\x80\x98If she\xe2\x80\x99s in want of a husband now,\r\n  Then will it please her to step below?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n  The cat runs quickly up the stair,\r\n  And lets her tail fly here and there,\r\n  Until she comes to the parlour door.\r\n  With her five gold rings at the door she knocks:\r\n \xe2\x80\x98Are you within, good Mistress Fox?\r\n  If you\xe2\x80\x99re in want of a husband now,\r\n  Then will it please you to step below?\r\n\r\nMrs Fox asked: \xe2\x80\x98Has the gentleman red stockings on, and has he a pointed\r\nmouth?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98No,\xe2\x80\x99 answered the cat. \xe2\x80\x98Then he won\xe2\x80\x99t do for me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWhen the wolf was gone, came a dog, a stag, a hare, a bear, a lion, and\r\nall the beasts of the forest, one after the other. But one of the good\r\nqualities which old Mr Fox had possessed, was always lacking, and the\r\ncat had continually to send the suitors away. At length came a young\r\nfox. Then Mrs Fox said: \xe2\x80\x98Has the gentleman red stockings on, and has a\r\nlittle pointed mouth?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Yes,\xe2\x80\x99 said the cat, \xe2\x80\x98he has.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Then let him come\r\nupstairs,\xe2\x80\x99 said Mrs Fox, and ordered the servant to prepare the wedding\r\nfeast.\r\n\r\n \xe2\x80\x98Sweep me the room as clean as you can,\r\n  Up with the window, fling out my old man!\r\n  For many a fine fat mouse he brought,\r\n  Yet of his wife he never thought,\r\n  But ate up every one he caught.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThen the wedding was solemnized with young Mr Fox, and there was much\r\nrejoicing and dancing; and if they have not left off, they are dancing\r\nstill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SALAD\r\n\r\nAs a merry young huntsman was once going briskly along through a wood,\r\nthere came up a little old woman, and said to him, \xe2\x80\x98Good day, good day;\r\nyou seem merry enough, but I am hungry and thirsty; do pray give me\r\nsomething to eat.\xe2\x80\x99 The huntsman took pity on her, and put his hand in\r\nhis pocket and gave her what he had. Then he wanted to go his way; but\r\nshe took hold of him, and said, \xe2\x80\x98Listen, my friend, to what I am going\r\nto tell you; I will reward you for your kindness; go your way, and after\r\na little time you will come to a tree where you will see nine birds\r\nsitting on a cloak. Shoot into the midst of them, and one will fall down\r\ndead: the cloak will fall too; take it, it is a wishing-cloak, and when\r\nyou wear it you will find yourself at any place where you may wish to\r\nbe. Cut open the dead bird, take out its heart and keep it, and you will\r\nfind a piece of gold under your pillow every morning when you rise. It\r\nis the bird\xe2\x80\x99s heart that will bring you this good luck.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe huntsman thanked her, and thought to himself, \xe2\x80\x98If all this does\r\nhappen, it will be a fine thing for me.\xe2\x80\x99 When he had gone a hundred\r\nsteps or so, he heard a screaming and chirping in the branches over him,\r\nand looked up and saw a flock of birds pulling a cloak with their bills\r\nand feet; screaming, fighting, and tugging at each other as if\r\neach wished to have it himself. \xe2\x80\x98Well,\xe2\x80\x99 said the huntsman, \xe2\x80\x98this is\r\nwonderful; this happens just as the old woman said\xe2\x80\x99; then he shot into\r\nthe midst of them so that their feathers flew all about. Off went the\r\nflock chattering away; but one fell down dead, and the cloak with it.\r\nThen the huntsman did as the old woman told him, cut open the bird, took\r\nout the heart, and carried the cloak home with him.\r\n\r\nThe next morning when he awoke he lifted up his pillow, and there lay\r\nthe piece of gold glittering underneath; the same happened next day, and\r\nindeed every day when he arose. He heaped up a great deal of gold, and\r\nat last thought to himself, \xe2\x80\x98Of what use is this gold to me whilst I am\r\nat home? I will go out into the world and look about me.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThen he took leave of his friends, and hung his bag and bow about his\r\nneck, and went his way. It so happened that his road one day led through\r\na thick wood, at the end of which was a large castle in a green meadow,\r\nand at one of the windows stood an old woman with a very beautiful young\r\nlady by her side looking about them. Now the old woman was a witch, and\r\nsaid to the young lady, \xe2\x80\x98There is a young man coming out of the wood who\r\ncarries a wonderful prize; we must get it away from him, my dear child,\r\nfor it is more fit for us than for him. He has a bird\xe2\x80\x99s heart that\r\nbrings a piece of gold under his pillow every morning.\xe2\x80\x99 Meantime the\r\nhuntsman came nearer and looked at the lady, and said to himself, \xe2\x80\x98I\r\nhave been travelling so long that I should like to go into this castle\r\nand rest myself, for I have money enough to pay for anything I want\xe2\x80\x99;\r\nbut the real reason was, that he wanted to see more of the beautiful\r\nlady. Then he went into the house, and was welcomed kindly; and it was\r\nnot long before he was so much in love that he thought of nothing else\r\nbut looking at the lady\xe2\x80\x99s eyes, and doing everything that she wished.\r\nThen the old woman said, \xe2\x80\x98Now is the time for getting the bird\xe2\x80\x99s heart.\xe2\x80\x99\r\nSo the lady stole it away, and he never found any more gold under his\r\npillow, for it lay now under the young lady\xe2\x80\x99s, and the old woman took it\r\naway every morning; but he was so much in love that he never missed his\r\nprize.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Well,\xe2\x80\x99 said the old witch, \xe2\x80\x98we have got the bird\xe2\x80\x99s heart, but not the\r\nwishing-cloak yet, and that we must also get.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Let us leave him that,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsaid the young lady; \xe2\x80\x98he has already lost his wealth.\xe2\x80\x99 Then the witch\r\nwas very angry, and said, \xe2\x80\x98Such a cloak is a very rare and wonderful\r\nthing, and I must and will have it.\xe2\x80\x99 So she did as the old woman told\r\nher, and set herself at the window, and looked about the country and\r\nseemed very sorrowful; then the huntsman said, \xe2\x80\x98What makes you so sad?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Alas! dear sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said she, \xe2\x80\x98yonder lies the granite rock where all the\r\ncostly diamonds grow, and I want so much to go there, that whenever I\r\nthink of it I cannot help being sorrowful, for who can reach it? only\r\nthe birds and the flies--man cannot.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98If that\xe2\x80\x99s all your grief,\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nthe huntsman, \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll take you there with all my heart\xe2\x80\x99; so he drew her under\r\nhis cloak, and the moment he wished to be on the granite mountain they\r\nwere both there. The diamonds glittered so on all sides that they were\r\ndelighted with the sight and picked up the finest. But the old witch\r\nmade a deep sleep come upon him, and he said to the young lady, \xe2\x80\x98Let us\r\nsit down and rest ourselves a little, I am so tired that I cannot stand\r\nany longer.\xe2\x80\x99 So they sat down, and he laid his head in her lap and\r\nfell asleep; and whilst he was sleeping on she took the cloak from\r\nhis shoulders, hung it on her own, picked up the diamonds, and wished\r\nherself home again.\r\n\r\nWhen he awoke and found that his lady had tricked him, and left him\r\nalone on the wild rock, he said, \xe2\x80\x98Alas! what roguery there is in the\r\nworld!\xe2\x80\x99 and there he sat in great grief and fear, not knowing what to\r\ndo. Now this rock belonged to fierce giants who lived upon it; and as\r\nhe saw three of them striding about, he thought to himself, \xe2\x80\x98I can only\r\nsave myself by feigning to be asleep\xe2\x80\x99; so he laid himself down as if he\r\nwere in a sound sleep. When the giants came up to him, the first pushed\r\nhim with his foot, and said, \xe2\x80\x98What worm is this that lies here curled\r\nup?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Tread upon him and kill him,\xe2\x80\x99 said the second. \xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s not worth the\r\ntrouble,\xe2\x80\x99 said the third; \xe2\x80\x98let him live, he\xe2\x80\x99ll go climbing higher up the\r\nmountain, and some cloud will come rolling and carry him away.\xe2\x80\x99 And they\r\npassed on. But the huntsman had heard all they said; and as soon as they\r\nwere gone, he climbed to the top of the mountain, and when he had sat\r\nthere a short time a cloud came rolling around him, and caught him in a\r\nwhirlwind and bore him along for some time, till it settled in a garden,\r\nand he fell quite gently to the ground amongst the greens and cabbages.\r\n\r\nThen he looked around him, and said, \xe2\x80\x98I wish I had something to eat, if\r\nnot I shall be worse off than before; for here I see neither apples\r\nnor pears, nor any kind of fruits, nothing but vegetables.\xe2\x80\x99 At last he\r\nthought to himself, \xe2\x80\x98I can eat salad, it will refresh and strengthen\r\nme.\xe2\x80\x99 So he picked out a fine head and ate of it; but scarcely had he\r\nswallowed two bites when he felt himself quite changed, and saw with\r\nhorror that he was turned into an ass. However, he still felt very\r\nhungry, and the salad tasted very nice; so he ate on till he came\r\nto another kind of salad, and scarcely had he tasted it when he felt\r\nanother change come over him, and soon saw that he was lucky enough to\r\nhave found his old shape again.\r\n\r\nThen he laid himself down and slept off a little of his weariness; and\r\nwhen he awoke the next morning he broke off a head both of the good and\r\nthe bad salad, and thought to himself, \xe2\x80\x98This will help me to my fortune\r\nagain, and enable me to pay off some folks for their treachery.\xe2\x80\x99 So he\r\nwent away to try and find the castle of his friends; and after wandering\r\nabout a few days he luckily found it. Then he stained his face all over\r\nbrown, so that even his mother would not have known him, and went into\r\nthe castle and asked for a lodging; \xe2\x80\x98I am so tired,\xe2\x80\x99 said he, \xe2\x80\x98that I\r\ncan go no farther.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Countryman,\xe2\x80\x99 said the witch, \xe2\x80\x98who are you? and what\r\nis your business?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98I am,\xe2\x80\x99 said he, \xe2\x80\x98a messenger sent by the king to\r\nfind the finest salad that grows under the sun. I have been lucky\r\nenough to find it, and have brought it with me; but the heat of the sun\r\nscorches so that it begins to wither, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that I can carry\r\nit farther.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWhen the witch and the young lady heard of his beautiful salad, they\r\nlonged to taste it, and said, \xe2\x80\x98Dear countryman, let us just taste it.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\xe2\x80\x98To be sure,\xe2\x80\x99 answered he; \xe2\x80\x98I have two heads of it with me, and will\r\ngive you one\xe2\x80\x99; so he opened his bag and gave them the bad. Then the\r\nwitch herself took it into the kitchen to be dressed; and when it was\r\nready she could not wait till it was carried up, but took a few leaves\r\nimmediately and put them in her mouth, and scarcely were they swallowed\r\nwhen she lost her own form and ran braying down into the court in the\r\nform of an ass. Now the servant-maid came into the kitchen, and seeing\r\nthe salad ready, was going to carry it up; but on the way she too felt a\r\nwish to taste it as the old woman had done, and ate some leaves; so she\r\nalso was turned into an ass and ran after the other, letting the dish\r\nwith the salad fall on the ground. The messenger sat all this time with\r\nthe beautiful young lady, and as nobody came with the salad and she\r\nlonged to taste it, she said, \xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t know where the salad can be.\xe2\x80\x99\r\nThen he thought something must have happened, and said, \xe2\x80\x98I will go\r\ninto the kitchen and see.\xe2\x80\x99 And as he went he saw two asses in the court\r\nrunning about, and the salad lying on the ground. \xe2\x80\x98All right!\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nhe; \xe2\x80\x98those two have had their share.\xe2\x80\x99 Then he took up the rest of\r\nthe leaves, laid them on the dish and brought them to the young lady,\r\nsaying, \xe2\x80\x98I bring you the dish myself that you may not wait any longer.\xe2\x80\x99\r\nSo she ate of it, and like the others ran off into the court braying\r\naway.\r\n\r\nThen the huntsman washed his face and went into the court that they\r\nmight know him. \xe2\x80\x98Now you shall be paid for your roguery,\xe2\x80\x99 said he; and\r\ntied them all three to a rope and took them along with him till he\r\ncame to a mill and knocked at the window. \xe2\x80\x98What\xe2\x80\x99s the matter?\xe2\x80\x99 said the\r\nmiller. \xe2\x80\x98I have three tiresome beasts here,\xe2\x80\x99 said the other; \xe2\x80\x98if you\r\nwill take them, give them food and room, and treat them as I tell you,\r\nI will pay you whatever you ask.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98With all my heart,\xe2\x80\x99 said the miller;\r\n\xe2\x80\x98but how shall I treat them?\xe2\x80\x99 Then the huntsman said, \xe2\x80\x98Give the old\r\none stripes three times a day and hay once; give the next (who was\r\nthe servant-maid) stripes once a day and hay three times; and give\r\nthe youngest (who was the beautiful lady) hay three times a day and\r\nno stripes\xe2\x80\x99: for he could not find it in his heart to have her beaten.\r\nAfter this he went back to the castle, where he found everything he\r\nwanted.\r\n\r\nSome days after, the miller came to him and told him that the old ass\r\nwas dead; \xe2\x80\x98The other two,\xe2\x80\x99 said he, \xe2\x80\x98are alive and eat, but are so\r\nsorrowful that they cannot last long.\xe2\x80\x99 Then the huntsman pitied them,\r\nand told the miller to drive them back to him, and when they came, he\r\ngave them some of the good salad to eat. And the beautiful young lady\r\nfell upon her knees before him, and said, \xe2\x80\x98O dearest huntsman! forgive\r\nme all the ill I have done you; my mother forced me to it, it was\r\nagainst my will, for I always loved you very much. Your wishing-cloak\r\nhangs up in the closet, and as for the bird\xe2\x80\x99s heart, I will give it you\r\ntoo.\xe2\x80\x99 But he said, \xe2\x80\x98Keep it, it will be just the same thing, for I mean\r\nto make you my wife.\xe2\x80\x99 So they were married, and lived together very\r\nhappily till they died.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STORY OF THE YOUTH WHO WENT FORTH TO LEARN WHAT FEAR WAS\r\n\r\nA certain father had two sons, the elder of who was smart and sensible,\r\nand could do everything, but the younger was stupid and could neither\r\nlearn nor understand anything, and when people saw him they said:\r\n\xe2\x80\x98There\xe2\x80\x99s a fellow who will give his father some trouble!\xe2\x80\x99 When anything\r\nhad to be done, it was always the elder who was forced to do it; but\r\nif his father bade him fetch anything when it was late, or in the\r\nnight-time, and the way led through the churchyard, or any other dismal\r\nplace, he answered: \xe2\x80\x98Oh, no father, I\xe2\x80\x99ll not go there, it makes me\r\nshudder!\xe2\x80\x99 for he was afraid. Or when stories were told by the fire at\r\nnight which made the flesh creep, the listeners sometimes said: \xe2\x80\x98Oh,\r\nit makes us shudder!\xe2\x80\x99 The younger sat in a corner and listened with\r\nthe rest of them, and could not imagine what they could mean. \xe2\x80\x98They are\r\nalways saying: \xe2\x80\x9cIt makes me shudder, it makes me shudder!\xe2\x80\x9d It does not\r\nmake me shudder,\xe2\x80\x99 thought he. \xe2\x80\x98That, too, must be an art of which I\r\nunderstand nothing!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nNow it came to pass that his father said to him one day: \xe2\x80\x98Hearken to me,\r\nyou fellow in the corner there, you are growing tall and strong, and you\r\ntoo must learn something by which you can earn your bread. Look how your\r\nbrother works, but you do not even earn your salt.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Well, father,\xe2\x80\x99 he\r\nreplied, \xe2\x80\x98I am quite willing to learn something--indeed, if it could but\r\nbe managed, I should like to learn how to shudder. I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand\r\nthat at all yet.\xe2\x80\x99 The elder brother smiled when he heard that, and\r\nthought to himself: \xe2\x80\x98Goodness, what a blockhead that brother of mine is!\r\nHe will never be good for anything as long as he lives! He who wants to\r\nbe a sickle must bend himself betimes.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe father sighed, and answered him: \xe2\x80\x98You shall soon learn what it is to\r\nshudder, but you will not earn your bread by that.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSoon after this the sexton came to the house on a visit, and the father\r\nbewailed his trouble, and told him how his younger son was so backward\r\nin every respect that he knew nothing and learnt nothing. \xe2\x80\x98Just think,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsaid he, \xe2\x80\x98when I asked him how he was going to earn his bread, he\r\nactually wanted to learn to shudder.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98If that be all,\xe2\x80\x99 replied the\r\nsexton, \xe2\x80\x98he can learn that with me. Send him to me, and I will soon\r\npolish him.\xe2\x80\x99 The father was glad to do it, for he thought: \xe2\x80\x98It will\r\ntrain the boy a little.\xe2\x80\x99 The sexton therefore took him into his house,\r\nand he had to ring the church bell. After a day or two, the sexton awoke\r\nhim at midnight, and bade him arise and go up into the church tower and\r\nring the bell. \xe2\x80\x98You shall soon learn what shuddering is,\xe2\x80\x99 thought he,\r\nand secretly went there before him; and when the boy was at the top of\r\nthe tower and turned round, and was just going to take hold of the bell\r\nrope, he saw a white figure standing on the stairs opposite the sounding\r\nhole. \xe2\x80\x98Who is there?\xe2\x80\x99 cried he, but the figure made no reply, and did\r\nnot move or stir. \xe2\x80\x98Give an answer,\xe2\x80\x99 cried the boy, \xe2\x80\x98or take yourself\r\noff, you have no business here at night.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe sexton, however, remained standing motionless that the boy might\r\nthink he was a ghost. The boy cried a second time: \xe2\x80\x98What do you want\r\nhere?--speak if you are an honest fellow, or I will throw you down the\r\nsteps!\xe2\x80\x99 The sexton thought: \xe2\x80\x98He can\xe2\x80\x99t mean to be as bad as his words,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nuttered no sound and stood as if he were made of stone. Then the boy\r\ncalled to him for the third time, and as that was also to no purpose,\r\nhe ran against him and pushed the ghost down the stairs, so that it fell\r\ndown the ten steps and remained lying there in a corner. Thereupon he\r\nrang the bell, went home, and without saying a word went to bed, and\r\nfell asleep. The sexton\xe2\x80\x99s wife waited a long time for her husband, but\r\nhe did not come back. At length she became uneasy, and wakened the boy,\r\nand asked: \xe2\x80\x98Do you know where my husband is? He climbed up the tower\r\nbefore you did.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98No, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know,\xe2\x80\x99 replied the boy, \xe2\x80\x98but someone was\r\nstanding by the sounding hole on the other side of the steps, and as he\r\nwould neither gave an answer nor go away, I took him for a scoundrel,\r\nand threw him downstairs. Just go there and you will see if it was he.\r\nI should be sorry if it were.\xe2\x80\x99 The woman ran away and found her husband,\r\nwho was lying moaning in the corner, and had broken his leg.\r\n\r\nShe carried him down, and then with loud screams she hastened to the\r\nboy\xe2\x80\x99s father, \xe2\x80\x98Your boy,\xe2\x80\x99 cried she, \xe2\x80\x98has been the cause of a great\r\nmisfortune! He has thrown my husband down the steps so that he broke his\r\nleg. Take the good-for-nothing fellow out of our house.\xe2\x80\x99 The father was\r\nterrified, and ran thither and scolded the boy. \xe2\x80\x98What wicked tricks\r\nare these?\xe2\x80\x99 said he. \xe2\x80\x98The devil must have put them into your head.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Father,\xe2\x80\x99 he replied, \xe2\x80\x98do listen to me. I am quite innocent. He was\r\nstanding there by night like one intent on doing evil. I did not know\r\nwho it was, and I entreated him three times either to speak or to go\r\naway.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Ah,\xe2\x80\x99 said the father, \xe2\x80\x98I have nothing but unhappiness with you.\r\nGo out of my sight. I will see you no more.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, father, right willingly, wait only until it is day. Then will I\r\ngo forth and learn how to shudder, and then I shall, at any rate,\r\nunderstand one art which will support me.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Learn what you will,\xe2\x80\x99 spoke\r\nthe father, \xe2\x80\x98it is all the same to me. Here are fifty talers for you.\r\nTake these and go into the wide world, and tell no one from whence you\r\ncome, and who is your father, for I have reason to be ashamed of you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Yes, father, it shall be as you will. If you desire nothing more than\r\nthat, I can easily keep it in mind.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWhen the day dawned, therefore, the boy put his fifty talers into his\r\npocket, and went forth on the great highway, and continually said to\r\nhimself: \xe2\x80\x98If I could but shudder! If I could but shudder!\xe2\x80\x99 Then a man\r\napproached who heard this conversation which the youth was holding with\r\nhimself, and when they had walked a little farther to where they could\r\nsee the gallows, the man said to him: \xe2\x80\x98Look, there is the tree where\r\nseven men have married the ropemaker\xe2\x80\x99s daughter, and are now learning\r\nhow to fly. Sit down beneath it, and wait till night comes, and you will\r\nsoon learn how to shudder.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98If that is all that is wanted,\xe2\x80\x99 answered\r\nthe youth, \xe2\x80\x98it is easily done; but if I learn how to shudder as fast as\r\nthat, you shall have my fifty talers. Just come back to me early in the\r\nmorning.\xe2\x80\x99 Then the youth went to the gallows, sat down beneath it, and\r\nwaited till evening came. And as he was cold, he lighted himself a fire,\r\nbut at midnight the wind blew so sharply that in spite of his fire, he\r\ncould not get warm. And as the wind knocked the hanged men against each\r\nother, and they moved backwards and forwards, he thought to himself:\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If you shiver below by the fire, how those up above must freeze and\r\nsuffer!\xe2\x80\x99 And as he felt pity for them, he raised the ladder, and climbed\r\nup, unbound one of them after the other, and brought down all seven.\r\nThen he stoked the fire, blew it, and set them all round it to warm\r\nthemselves. But they sat there and did not stir, and the fire caught\r\ntheir clothes. So he said: \xe2\x80\x98Take care, or I will hang you up again.\xe2\x80\x99 The\r\ndead men, however, did not hear, but were quite silent, and let their\r\nrags go on burning. At this he grew angry, and said: \xe2\x80\x98If you will not\r\ntake care, I cannot help you, I will not be burnt with you,\xe2\x80\x99 and he hung\r\nthem up again each in his turn. Then he sat down by his fire and fell\r\nasleep, and the next morning the man came to him and wanted to have\r\nthe fifty talers, and said: \xe2\x80\x98Well do you know how to shudder?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98No,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nanswered he, \xe2\x80\x98how should I know? Those fellows up there did not open\r\ntheir mouths, and were so stupid that they let the few old rags which\r\nthey had on their bodies get burnt.\xe2\x80\x99 Then the man saw that he would not\r\nget the fifty talers that day, and went away saying: \xe2\x80\x98Such a youth has\r\nnever come my way before.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe youth likewise went his way, and once more began to mutter to\r\nhimself: \xe2\x80\x98Ah, if I could but shudder! Ah, if I could but shudder!\xe2\x80\x99 A\r\nwaggoner who was striding behind him heard this and asked: \xe2\x80\x98Who are\r\nyou?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t know,\xe2\x80\x99 answered the youth. Then the waggoner asked: \xe2\x80\x98From\r\nwhence do you come?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98I know not.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Who is your father?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98That I may\r\nnot tell you.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98What is it that you are always muttering between your\r\nteeth?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Ah,\xe2\x80\x99 replied the youth, \xe2\x80\x98I do so wish I could shudder, but\r\nno one can teach me how.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Enough of your foolish chatter,\xe2\x80\x99 said the\r\nwaggoner. \xe2\x80\x98Come, go with me, I will see about a place for you.\xe2\x80\x99 The\r\nyouth went with the waggoner, and in the evening they arrived at an inn\r\nwhere they wished to pass the night. Then at the entrance of the parlour\r\nthe youth again said quite loudly: \xe2\x80\x98If I could but shudder! If I could\r\nbut shudder!\xe2\x80\x99 The host who heard this, laughed and said: \xe2\x80\x98If that is\r\nyour desire, there ought to be a good opportunity for you here.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Ah,\r\nbe silent,\xe2\x80\x99 said the hostess, \xe2\x80\x98so many prying persons have already lost\r\ntheir lives, it would be a pity and a shame if such beautiful eyes as\r\nthese should never see the daylight again.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBut the youth said: \xe2\x80\x98However difficult it may be, I will learn it. For\r\nthis purpose indeed have I journeyed forth.\xe2\x80\x99 He let the host have\r\nno rest, until the latter told him, that not far from thence stood a\r\nhaunted castle where anyone could very easily learn what shuddering was,\r\nif he would but watch in it for three nights. The king had promised that\r\nhe who would venture should have his daughter to wife, and she was the\r\nmost beautiful maiden the sun shone on. Likewise in the castle lay great\r\ntreasures, which were guarded by evil spirits, and these treasures would\r\nthen be freed, and would make a poor man rich enough. Already many men\r\nhad gone into the castle, but as yet none had come out again. Then the\r\nyouth went next morning to the king, and said: \xe2\x80\x98If it be allowed, I will\r\nwillingly watch three nights in the haunted castle.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe king looked at him, and as the youth pleased him, he said: \xe2\x80\x98You may\r\nask for three things to take into the castle with you, but they must\r\nbe things without life.\xe2\x80\x99 Then he answered: \xe2\x80\x98Then I ask for a fire, a\r\nturning lathe, and a cutting-board with the knife.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe king had these things carried into the castle for him during the\r\nday. When night was drawing near, the youth went up and made himself\r\na bright fire in one of the rooms, placed the cutting-board and knife\r\nbeside it, and seated himself by the turning-lathe. \xe2\x80\x98Ah, if I could\r\nbut shudder!\xe2\x80\x99 said he, \xe2\x80\x98but I shall not learn it here either.\xe2\x80\x99 Towards\r\nmidnight he was about to poke his fire, and as he was blowing it,\r\nsomething cried suddenly from one corner: \xe2\x80\x98Au, miau! how cold we are!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You fools!\xe2\x80\x99 cried he, \xe2\x80\x98what are you crying about? If you are cold, come\r\nand take a seat by the fire and warm yourselves.\xe2\x80\x99 And when he had said\r\nthat, two great black cats came with one tremendous leap and sat down\r\non each side of him, and looked savagely at him with their fiery\r\neyes. After a short time, when they had warmed themselves, they said:\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Comrade, shall we have a game of cards?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Why not?\xe2\x80\x99 he replied, \xe2\x80\x98but\r\njust show me your paws.\xe2\x80\x99 Then they stretched out their claws. \xe2\x80\x98Oh,\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nhe, \xe2\x80\x98what long nails you have! Wait, I must first cut them for you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\nThereupon he seized them by the throats, put them on the cutting-board\r\nand screwed their feet fast. \xe2\x80\x98I have looked at your fingers,\xe2\x80\x99 said he,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98and my fancy for card-playing has gone,\xe2\x80\x99 and he struck them dead and\r\nthrew them out into the water. But when he had made away with these two,\r\nand was about to sit down again by his fire, out from every hole and\r\ncorner came black cats and black dogs with red-hot chains, and more\r\nand more of them came until he could no longer move, and they yelled\r\nhorribly, and got on his fire, pulled it to pieces, and tried to put\r\nit out. He watched them for a while quietly, but at last when they were\r\ngoing too far, he seized his cutting-knife, and cried: \xe2\x80\x98Away with you,\r\nvermin,\xe2\x80\x99 and began to cut them down. Some of them ran away, the others\r\nhe killed, and threw out into the fish-pond. When he came back he fanned\r\nthe embers of his fire again and warmed himself. And as he thus sat, his\r\neyes would keep open no longer, and he felt a desire to sleep. Then he\r\nlooked round and saw a great bed in the corner. \xe2\x80\x98That is the very thing\r\nfor me,\xe2\x80\x99 said he, and got into it. When he was just going to shut his\r\neyes, however, the bed began to move of its own accord, and went over\r\nthe whole of the castle. \xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s right,\xe2\x80\x99 said he, \xe2\x80\x98but go faster.\xe2\x80\x99 Then\r\nthe bed rolled on as if six horses were harnessed to it, up and down,\r\nover thresholds and stairs, but suddenly hop, hop, it turned over upside\r\ndown, and lay on him like a mountain. But he threw quilts and pillows up\r\nin the air, got out and said: \xe2\x80\x98Now anyone who likes, may drive,\xe2\x80\x99 and\r\nlay down by his fire, and slept till it was day. In the morning the king\r\ncame, and when he saw him lying there on the ground, he thought the evil\r\nspirits had killed him and he was dead. Then said he: \xe2\x80\x98After all it is a\r\npity,--for so handsome a man.\xe2\x80\x99 The youth heard it, got up, and said: \xe2\x80\x98It\r\nhas not come to that yet.\xe2\x80\x99 Then the king was astonished, but very glad,\r\nand asked how he had fared. \xe2\x80\x98Very well indeed,\xe2\x80\x99 answered he; \xe2\x80\x98one\r\nnight is past, the two others will pass likewise.\xe2\x80\x99 Then he went to the\r\ninnkeeper, who opened his eyes very wide, and said: \xe2\x80\x98I never expected to\r\nsee you alive again! Have you learnt how to shudder yet?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98No,\xe2\x80\x99 said he,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98it is all in vain. If someone would but tell me!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe second night he again went up into the old castle, sat down by the\r\nfire, and once more began his old song: \xe2\x80\x98If I could but shudder!\xe2\x80\x99 When\r\nmidnight came, an uproar and noise of tumbling about was heard; at\r\nfirst it was low, but it grew louder and louder. Then it was quiet for\r\na while, and at length with a loud scream, half a man came down the\r\nchimney and fell before him. \xe2\x80\x98Hullo!\xe2\x80\x99 cried he, \xe2\x80\x98another half belongs\r\nto this. This is not enough!\xe2\x80\x99 Then the uproar began again, there was a\r\nroaring and howling, and the other half fell down likewise. \xe2\x80\x98Wait,\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nhe, \xe2\x80\x98I will just stoke up the fire a little for you.\xe2\x80\x99 When he had done\r\nthat and looked round again, the two pieces were joined together, and a\r\nhideous man was sitting in his place. \xe2\x80\x98That is no part of our bargain,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsaid the youth, \xe2\x80\x98the bench is mine.\xe2\x80\x99 The man wanted to push him away;\r\nthe youth, however, would not allow that, but thrust him off with all\r\nhis strength, and seated himself again in his own place. Then still more\r\nmen fell down, one after the other; they brought nine dead men\xe2\x80\x99s legs\r\nand two skulls, and set them up and played at nine-pins with them. The\r\nyouth also wanted to play and said: \xe2\x80\x98Listen you, can I join you?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Yes,\r\nif you have any money.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Money enough,\xe2\x80\x99 replied he, \xe2\x80\x98but your balls are\r\nnot quite round.\xe2\x80\x99 Then he took the skulls and put them in the lathe and\r\nturned them till they were round. \xe2\x80\x98There, now they will roll better!\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsaid he. \xe2\x80\x98Hurrah! now we\xe2\x80\x99ll have fun!\xe2\x80\x99 He played with them and lost some\r\nof his money, but when it struck twelve, everything vanished from his\r\nsight. He lay down and quietly fell asleep. Next morning the king came\r\nto inquire after him. \xe2\x80\x98How has it fared with you this time?\xe2\x80\x99 asked he.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I have been playing at nine-pins,\xe2\x80\x99 he answered, \xe2\x80\x98and have lost a couple\r\nof farthings.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Have you not shuddered then?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98What?\xe2\x80\x99 said he, \xe2\x80\x98I have\r\nhad a wonderful time! If I did but know what it was to shudder!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe third night he sat down again on his bench and said quite sadly:\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If I could but shudder.\xe2\x80\x99 When it grew late, six tall men came in and\r\nbrought a coffin. Then he said: \xe2\x80\x98Ha, ha, that is certainly my little\r\ncousin, who died only a few days ago,\xe2\x80\x99 and he beckoned with his finger,\r\nand cried: \xe2\x80\x98Come, little cousin, come.\xe2\x80\x99 They placed the coffin on the\r\nground, but he went to it and took the lid off, and a dead man lay\r\ntherein. He felt his face, but it was cold as ice. \xe2\x80\x98Wait,\xe2\x80\x99 said he, \xe2\x80\x98I\r\nwill warm you a little,\xe2\x80\x99 and went to the fire and warmed his hand and\r\nlaid it on the dead man\xe2\x80\x99s face, but he remained cold. Then he took him\r\nout, and sat down by the fire and laid him on his breast and rubbed his\r\narms that the blood might circulate again. As this also did no good, he\r\nthought to himself: \xe2\x80\x98When two people lie in bed together, they warm each\r\nother,\xe2\x80\x99 and carried him to the bed, covered him over and lay down by\r\nhim. After a short time the dead man became warm too, and began to move.\r\nThen said the youth, \xe2\x80\x98See, little cousin, have I not warmed you?\xe2\x80\x99 The\r\ndead man, however, got up and cried: \xe2\x80\x98Now will I strangle you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What!\xe2\x80\x99 said he, \xe2\x80\x98is that the way you thank me? You shall at once go\r\ninto your coffin again,\xe2\x80\x99 and he took him up, threw him into it, and shut\r\nthe lid. Then came the six men and carried him away again. \xe2\x80\x98I cannot\r\nmanage to shudder,\xe2\x80\x99 said he. \xe2\x80\x98I shall never learn it here as long as I\r\nlive.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThen a man entered who was taller than all others, and looked terrible.\r\nHe was old, however, and had a long white beard. \xe2\x80\x98You wretch,\xe2\x80\x99 cried he,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98you shall soon learn what it is to shudder, for you shall die.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Not so\r\nfast,\xe2\x80\x99 replied the youth. \xe2\x80\x98If I am to die, I shall have to have a say\r\nin it.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98I will soon seize you,\xe2\x80\x99 said the fiend. \xe2\x80\x98Softly, softly, do not\r\ntalk so big. I am as strong as you are, and perhaps even stronger.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\xe2\x80\x98We shall see,\xe2\x80\x99 said the old man. \xe2\x80\x98If you are stronger, I will let you\r\ngo--come, we will try.\xe2\x80\x99 Then he led him by dark passages to a smith\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nforge, took an axe, and with one blow struck an anvil into the ground.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I can do better than that,\xe2\x80\x99 said the youth, and went to the other\r\nanvil. The old man placed himself near and wanted to look on, and his\r\nwhite beard hung down. Then the youth seized the axe, split the anvil\r\nwith one blow, and in it caught the old man\xe2\x80\x99s beard. \xe2\x80\x98Now I have you,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsaid the youth. \xe2\x80\x98Now it is your turn to die.\xe2\x80\x99 Then he seized an iron bar\r\nand beat the old man till he moaned and entreated him to stop, when he\r\nwould give him great riches. The youth drew out the axe and let him go.\r\nThe old man led him back into the castle, and in a cellar showed him\r\nthree chests full of gold. \xe2\x80\x98Of these,\xe2\x80\x99 said he, \xe2\x80\x98one part is for the\r\npoor, the other for the king, the third yours.\xe2\x80\x99 In the meantime it\r\nstruck twelve, and the spirit disappeared, so that the youth stood in\r\ndarkness. \xe2\x80\x98I shall still be able to find my way out,\xe2\x80\x99 said he, and felt\r\nabout, found the way into the room, and slept there by his fire.\r\nNext morning the king came and said: \xe2\x80\x98Now you must have learnt what\r\nshuddering is?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98No,\xe2\x80\x99 he answered; \xe2\x80\x98what can it be? My dead cousin was\r\nhere, and a bearded man came and showed me a great deal of money down\r\nbelow, but no one told me what it was to shudder.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Then,\xe2\x80\x99 said the\r\nking, \xe2\x80\x98you have saved the castle, and shall marry my daughter.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98That\r\nis all very well,\xe2\x80\x99 said he, \xe2\x80\x98but still I do not know what it is to\r\nshudder!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThen the gold was brought up and the wedding celebrated; but howsoever\r\nmuch the young king loved his wife, and however happy he was, he still\r\nsaid always: \xe2\x80\x98If I could but shudder--if I could but shudder.\xe2\x80\x99 And this\r\nat last angered her. Her waiting-maid said: \xe2\x80\x98I will find a cure for him;\r\nhe shall soon learn what it is to shudder.\xe2\x80\x99 She went out to the stream\r\nwhich flowed through the garden, and had a whole bucketful of gudgeons\r\nbrought to her. At night when the young king was sleeping, his wife was\r\nto draw the clothes off him and empty the bucket full of cold water\r\nwith the gudgeons in it over him, so that the little fishes would\r\nsprawl about him. Then he woke up and cried: \xe2\x80\x98Oh, what makes me shudder\r\nso?--what makes me shudder so, dear wife? Ah! now I know what it is to\r\nshudder!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKING GRISLY-BEARD\r\n\r\nA great king of a land far away in the East had a daughter who was very\r\nbeautiful, but so proud, and haughty, and conceited, that none of the\r\nprinces who came to ask her in marriage was good enough for her, and she\r\nonly made sport of them.\r\n\r\nOnce upon a time the king held a great feast, and asked thither all\r\nher suitors; and they all sat in a row, ranged according to their\r\nrank--kings, and princes, and dukes, and earls, and counts, and barons,\r\nand knights. Then the princess came in, and as she passed by them she\r\nhad something spiteful to say to every one. The first was too fat: \xe2\x80\x98He\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nas round as a tub,\xe2\x80\x99 said she. The next was too tall: \xe2\x80\x98What a maypole!\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsaid she. The next was too short: \xe2\x80\x98What a dumpling!\xe2\x80\x99 said she. The\r\nfourth was too pale, and she called him \xe2\x80\x98Wallface.\xe2\x80\x99 The fifth was too\r\nred, so she called him \xe2\x80\x98Coxcomb.\xe2\x80\x99 The sixth was not straight enough;\r\nso she said he was like a green stick, that had been laid to dry over\r\na baker\xe2\x80\x99s oven. And thus she had some joke to crack upon every one: but\r\nshe laughed more than all at a good king who was there. \xe2\x80\x98Look at\r\nhim,\xe2\x80\x99 said she; \xe2\x80\x98his beard is like an old mop; he shall be called\r\nGrisly-beard.\xe2\x80\x99 So the king got the nickname of Grisly-beard.\r\n\r\nBut the old king was very angry when he saw how his daughter behaved,\r\nand how she ill-treated all his guests; and he vowed that, willing or\r\nunwilling, she should marry the first man, be he prince or beggar, that\r\ncame to the door.\r\n\r\nTwo days after there came by a travelling fiddler, who began to play\r\nunder the window and beg alms; and when the king heard him, he said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Let him come in.\xe2\x80\x99 So they brought in a dirty-looking fellow; and when\r\nhe had sung before the king and the princess, he begged a boon. Then the\r\nking said, \xe2\x80\x98You have sung so well, that I will give you my daughter for\r\nyour wife.\xe2\x80\x99 The princess begged and prayed; but the king said, \xe2\x80\x98I have\r\nsworn to give you to the first comer, and I will keep my word.\xe2\x80\x99 So words\r\nand tears were of no avail; the parson was sent for, and she was married\r\nto the fiddler. When this was over the king said, \xe2\x80\x98Now get ready to\r\ngo--you must not stay here--you must travel on with your husband.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThen the fiddler went his way, and took her with him, and they soon came\r\nto a great wood. \xe2\x80\x98Pray,\xe2\x80\x99 said she, \xe2\x80\x98whose is this wood?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98It belongs\r\nto King Grisly-beard,\xe2\x80\x99 answered he; \xe2\x80\x98hadst thou taken him, all had been\r\nthine.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Ah! unlucky wretch that I am!\xe2\x80\x99 sighed she; \xe2\x80\x98would that I had\r\nmarried King Grisly-beard!\xe2\x80\x99 Next they came to some fine meadows. \xe2\x80\x98Whose\r\nare these beautiful green meadows?\xe2\x80\x99 said she. \xe2\x80\x98They belong to King\r\nGrisly-beard, hadst thou taken him, they had all been thine.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Ah!\r\nunlucky wretch that I am!\xe2\x80\x99 said she; \xe2\x80\x98would that I had married King\r\nGrisly-beard!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThen they came to a great city. \xe2\x80\x98Whose is this noble city?\xe2\x80\x99 said she.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It belongs to King Grisly-beard; hadst thou taken him, it had all been\r\nthine.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Ah! wretch that I am!\xe2\x80\x99 sighed she; \xe2\x80\x98why did I not marry King\r\nGrisly-beard?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98That is no business of mine,\xe2\x80\x99 said the fiddler: \xe2\x80\x98why\r\nshould you wish for another husband? Am not I good enough for you?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAt last they came to a small cottage. \xe2\x80\x98What a paltry place!\xe2\x80\x99 said she;\r\n\xe2\x80\x98to whom does that little dirty hole belong?\xe2\x80\x99 Then the fiddler said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98That is your and my house, where we are to live.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Where are your\r\nservants?\xe2\x80\x99 cried she. \xe2\x80\x98What do we want with servants?\xe2\x80\x99 said he; \xe2\x80\x98you\r\nmust do for yourself whatever is to be done. Now make the fire, and put\r\non water and cook my supper, for I am very tired.\xe2\x80\x99 But the princess knew\r\nnothing of making fires and cooking, and the fiddler was forced to help\r\nher. When they had eaten a very scanty meal they went to bed; but the\r\nfiddler called her up very early in the morning to clean the house. Thus\r\nthey lived for two days: and when they had eaten up all there was in the\r\ncottage, the man said, \xe2\x80\x98Wife, we can\xe2\x80\x99t go on thus, spending money and\r\nearning nothing. You must learn to weave baskets.\xe2\x80\x99 Then he went out and\r\ncut willows, and brought them home, and she began to weave; but it made\r\nher fingers very sore. \xe2\x80\x98I see this work won\xe2\x80\x99t do,\xe2\x80\x99 said he: \xe2\x80\x98try and\r\nspin; perhaps you will do that better.\xe2\x80\x99 So she sat down and tried to\r\nspin; but the threads cut her tender fingers till the blood ran. \xe2\x80\x98See\r\nnow,\xe2\x80\x99 said the fiddler, \xe2\x80\x98you are good for nothing; you can do no work:\r\nwhat a bargain I have got! However, I\xe2\x80\x99ll try and set up a trade in pots\r\nand pans, and you shall stand in the market and sell them.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Alas!\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsighed she, \xe2\x80\x98if any of my father\xe2\x80\x99s court should pass by and see me\r\nstanding in the market, how they will laugh at me!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBut her husband did not care for that, and said she must work, if she\r\ndid not wish to die of hunger. At first the trade went well; for many\r\npeople, seeing such a beautiful woman, went to buy her wares, and paid\r\ntheir money without thinking of taking away the goods. They lived on\r\nthis as long as it lasted; and then her husband bought a fresh lot of\r\nware, and she sat herself down with it in the corner of the market; but\r\na drunken soldier soon came by, and rode his horse against her stall,\r\nand broke all her goods into a thousand pieces. Then she began to cry,\r\nand knew not what to do. \xe2\x80\x98Ah! what will become of me?\xe2\x80\x99 said she; \xe2\x80\x98what\r\nwill my husband say?\xe2\x80\x99 So she ran home and told him all. \xe2\x80\x98Who would\r\nhave thought you would have been so silly,\xe2\x80\x99 said he, \xe2\x80\x98as to put an\r\nearthenware stall in the corner of the market, where everybody passes?\r\nbut let us have no more crying; I see you are not fit for this sort of\r\nwork, so I have been to the king\xe2\x80\x99s palace, and asked if they did not\r\nwant a kitchen-maid; and they say they will take you, and there you will\r\nhave plenty to eat.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThus the princess became a kitchen-maid, and helped the cook to do all\r\nthe dirtiest work; but she was allowed to carry home some of the meat\r\nthat was left, and on this they lived.\r\n\r\nShe had not been there long before she heard that the king\xe2\x80\x99s eldest son\r\nwas passing by, going to be married; and she went to one of the windows\r\nand looked out. Everything was ready, and all the pomp and brightness of\r\nthe court was there. Then she bitterly grieved for the pride and folly\r\nwhich had brought her so low. And the servants gave her some of the rich\r\nmeats, which she put into her basket to take home.\r\n\r\nAll on a sudden, as she was going out, in came the king\xe2\x80\x99s son in golden\r\nclothes; and when he saw a beautiful woman at the door, he took her\r\nby the hand, and said she should be his partner in the dance; but she\r\ntrembled for fear, for she saw that it was King Grisly-beard, who was\r\nmaking sport of her. However, he kept fast hold, and led her in; and the\r\ncover of the basket came off, so that the meats in it fell about. Then\r\neverybody laughed and jeered at her; and she was so abashed, that she\r\nwished herself a thousand feet deep in the earth. She sprang to the\r\ndoor to run away; but on the steps King Grisly-beard overtook her, and\r\nbrought her back and said, \xe2\x80\x98Fear me not! I am the fiddler who has lived\r\nwith you in the hut. I brought you there because I really loved you. I\r\nam also the soldier that overset your stall. I have done all this only\r\nto cure you of your silly pride, and to show you the folly of your\r\nill-treatment of me. Now all is over: you have learnt wisdom, and it is\r\ntime to hold our marriage feast.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThen the chamberlains came and brought her the most beautiful robes; and\r\nher father and his whole court were there already, and welcomed her home\r\non her marriage. Joy was in every face and every heart. The feast was\r\ngrand; they danced and sang; all were merry; and I only wish that you\r\nand I had been of the party.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIRON HANS\r\n\r\nThere was once upon a time a king who had a great forest near his\r\npalace, full of all kinds of wild animals. One day he sent out a\r\nhuntsman to shoot him a roe, but he did not come back. \xe2\x80\x98Perhaps some\r\naccident has befallen him,\xe2\x80\x99 said the king, and the next day he sent out\r\ntwo more huntsmen who were to search for him, but they too stayed away.\r\nThen on the third day, he sent for all his huntsmen, and said: \xe2\x80\x98Scour\r\nthe whole forest through, and do not give up until you have found all\r\nthree.\xe2\x80\x99 But of these also, none came home again, none were seen again.\r\nFrom that time forth, no one would any longer venture into the forest,\r\nand it lay there in deep stillness and solitude, and nothing was seen\r\nof it, but sometimes an eagle or a hawk flying over it. This lasted for\r\nmany years, when an unknown huntsman announced himself to the king as\r\nseeking a situation, and offered to go into the dangerous forest. The\r\nking, however, would not give his consent, and said: \xe2\x80\x98It is not safe in\r\nthere; I fear it would fare with you no better than with the others,\r\nand you would never come out again.\xe2\x80\x99 The huntsman replied: \xe2\x80\x98Lord, I will\r\nventure it at my own risk, of fear I know nothing.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe huntsman therefore betook himself with his dog to the forest. It was\r\nnot long before the dog fell in with some game on the way, and wanted to\r\npursue it; but hardly had the dog run two steps when it stood before a\r\ndeep pool, could go no farther, and a naked arm stretched itself out of\r\nthe water, seized it, and drew it under. When the huntsman saw that, he\r\nwent back and fetched three men to come with buckets and bale out the\r\nwater. When they could see to the bottom there lay a wild man whose body\r\nwas brown like rusty iron, and whose hair hung over his face down to his\r\nknees. They bound him with cords, and led him away to the castle. There\r\nwas great astonishment over the wild man; the king, however, had him put\r\nin an iron cage in his courtyard, and forbade the door to be opened\r\non pain of death, and the queen herself was to take the key into her\r\nkeeping. And from this time forth everyone could again go into the\r\nforest with safety.\r\n\r\nThe king had a son of eight years, who was once playing in the\r\ncourtyard, and while he was playing, his golden ball fell into the cage.\r\nThe boy ran thither and said: \xe2\x80\x98Give me my ball out.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Not till you have\r\nopened the door for me,\xe2\x80\x99 answered the man. \xe2\x80\x98No,\xe2\x80\x99 said the boy, \xe2\x80\x98I will\r\nnot do that; the king has forbidden it,\xe2\x80\x99 and ran away. The next day he\r\nagain went and asked for his ball; the wild man said: \xe2\x80\x98Open my door,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nbut the boy would not. On the third day the king had ridden out hunting,\r\nand the boy went once more and said: \xe2\x80\x98I cannot open the door even if I\r\nwished, for I have not the key.\xe2\x80\x99 Then the wild man said: \xe2\x80\x98It lies under\r\nyour mother\xe2\x80\x99s pillow, you can get it there.\xe2\x80\x99 The boy, who wanted to have\r\nhis ball back, cast all thought to the winds, and brought the key. The\r\ndoor opened with difficulty, and the boy pinched his fingers. When it\r\nwas open the wild man stepped out, gave him the golden ball, and hurried\r\naway. The boy had become afraid; he called and cried after him: \xe2\x80\x98Oh,\r\nwild man, do not go away, or I shall be beaten!\xe2\x80\x99 The wild man turned\r\nback, took him up, set him on his shoulder, and went with hasty steps\r\ninto the forest. When the king came home, he observed the empty cage,\r\nand asked the queen how that had happened. She knew nothing about it,\r\nand sought the key, but it was gone. She called the boy, but no one\r\nanswered. The king sent out people to seek for him in the fields, but\r\nthey did not find him. Then he could easily guess what had happened, and\r\nmuch grief reigned in the royal court.\r\n\r\nWhen the wild man had once more reached the dark forest, he took the boy\r\ndown from his shoulder, and said to him: \xe2\x80\x98You will never see your father\r\nand mother again, but I will keep you with me, for you have set me free,\r\nand I have compassion on you. If you do all I bid you, you shall fare\r\nwell. Of treasure and gold have I enough, and more than anyone in the\r\nworld.\xe2\x80\x99 He made a bed of moss for the boy on which he slept, and the\r\nnext morning the man took him to a well, and said: \xe2\x80\x98Behold, the gold\r\nwell is as bright and clear as crystal, you shall sit beside it, and\r\ntake care that nothing falls into it, or it will be polluted. I will\r\ncome every evening to see if you have obeyed my order.\xe2\x80\x99 The boy placed\r\nhimself by the brink of the well, and often saw a golden fish or a\r\ngolden snake show itself therein, and took care that nothing fell in.\r\nAs he was thus sitting, his finger hurt him so violently that he\r\ninvoluntarily put it in the water. He drew it quickly out again, but saw\r\nthat it was quite gilded, and whatsoever pains he took to wash the gold\r\noff again, all was to no purpose. In the evening Iron Hans came back,\r\nlooked at the boy, and said: \xe2\x80\x98What has happened to the well?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Nothing\r\nnothing,\xe2\x80\x99 he answered, and held his finger behind his back, that the\r\nman might not see it. But he said: \xe2\x80\x98You have dipped your finger into\r\nthe water, this time it may pass, but take care you do not again let\r\nanything go in.\xe2\x80\x99 By daybreak the boy was already sitting by the well and\r\nwatching it. His finger hurt him again and he passed it over his head,\r\nand then unhappily a hair fell down into the well. He took it quickly\r\nout, but it was already quite gilded. Iron Hans came, and already knew\r\nwhat had happened. \xe2\x80\x98You have let a hair fall into the well,\xe2\x80\x99 said he.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I will allow you to watch by it once more, but if this happens for the\r\nthird time then the well is polluted and you can no longer remain with\r\nme.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nOn the third day, the boy sat by the well, and did not stir his finger,\r\nhowever much it hurt him. But the time was long to him, and he looked at\r\nthe reflection of his face on the surface of the water. And as he\r\nstill bent down more and more while he was doing so, and trying to look\r\nstraight into the eyes, his long hair fell down from his shoulders into\r\nthe water. He raised himself up quickly, but the whole of the hair of\r\nhis head was already golden and shone like the sun. You can imagine how\r\nterrified the poor boy was! He took his pocket-handkerchief and tied it\r\nround his head, in order that the man might not see it. When he came he\r\nalready knew everything, and said: \xe2\x80\x98Take the handkerchief off.\xe2\x80\x99 Then the\r\ngolden hair streamed forth, and let the boy excuse himself as he might,\r\nit was of no use. \xe2\x80\x98You have not stood the trial and can stay here no\r\nlonger. Go forth into the world, there you will learn what poverty is.\r\nBut as you have not a bad heart, and as I mean well by you, there is\r\none thing I will grant you; if you fall into any difficulty, come to the\r\nforest and cry: \xe2\x80\x9cIron Hans,\xe2\x80\x9d and then I will come and help you. My\r\npower is great, greater than you think, and I have gold and silver in\r\nabundance.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThen the king\xe2\x80\x99s son left the forest, and walked by beaten and unbeaten\r\npaths ever onwards until at length he reached a great city. There he\r\nlooked for work, but could find none, and he learnt nothing by which he\r\ncould help himself. At length he went to the palace, and asked if they\r\nwould take him in. The people about court did not at all know what use\r\nthey could make of him, but they liked him, and told him to stay. At\r\nlength the cook took him into his service, and said he might carry wood\r\nand water, and rake the cinders together. Once when it so happened that\r\nno one else was at hand, the cook ordered him to carry the food to the\r\nroyal table, but as he did not like to let his golden hair be seen, he\r\nkept his little cap on. Such a thing as that had never yet come under\r\nthe king\xe2\x80\x99s notice, and he said: \xe2\x80\x98When you come to the royal table you\r\nmust take your hat off.\xe2\x80\x99 He answered: \xe2\x80\x98Ah, Lord, I cannot; I have a bad\r\nsore place on my head.\xe2\x80\x99 Then the king had the cook called before him\r\nand scolded him, and asked how he could take such a boy as that into his\r\nservice; and that he was to send him away at once. The cook, however,\r\nhad pity on him, and exchanged him for the gardener\xe2\x80\x99s boy.\r\n\r\nAnd now the boy had to plant and water the garden, hoe and dig, and bear\r\nthe wind and bad weather. Once in summer when he was working alone in\r\nthe garden, the day was so warm he took his little cap off that the air\r\nmight cool him. As the sun shone on his hair it glittered and flashed so\r\nthat the rays fell into the bedroom of the king\xe2\x80\x99s daughter, and up she\r\nsprang to see what that could be. Then she saw the boy, and cried to\r\nhim: \xe2\x80\x98Boy, bring me a wreath of flowers.\xe2\x80\x99 He put his cap on with all\r\nhaste, and gathered wild field-flowers and bound them together. When he\r\nwas ascending the stairs with them, the gardener met him, and said: \xe2\x80\x98How\r\ncan you take the king\xe2\x80\x99s daughter a garland of such common flowers? Go\r\nquickly, and get another, and seek out the prettiest and rarest.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Oh,\r\nno,\xe2\x80\x99 replied the boy, \xe2\x80\x98the wild ones have more scent, and will please\r\nher better.\xe2\x80\x99 When he got into the room, the king\xe2\x80\x99s daughter said: \xe2\x80\x98Take\r\nyour cap off, it is not seemly to keep it on in my presence.\xe2\x80\x99 He again\r\nsaid: \xe2\x80\x98I may not, I have a sore head.\xe2\x80\x99 She, however, caught at his\r\ncap and pulled it off, and then his golden hair rolled down on his\r\nshoulders, and it was splendid to behold. He wanted to run out, but she\r\nheld him by the arm, and gave him a handful of ducats. With these he\r\ndeparted, but he cared nothing for the gold pieces. He took them to the\r\ngardener, and said: \xe2\x80\x98I present them to your children, they can play with\r\nthem.\xe2\x80\x99 The following day the king\xe2\x80\x99s daughter again called to him that he\r\nwas to bring her a wreath of field-flowers, and then he went in with it,\r\nshe instantly snatched at his cap, and wanted to take it away from him,\r\nbut he held it fast with both hands. She again gave him a handful of\r\nducats, but he would not keep them, and gave them to the gardener for\r\nplaythings for his children. On the third day things went just the\r\nsame; she could not get his cap away from him, and he would not have her\r\nmoney.\r\n\r\nNot long afterwards, the country was overrun by war. The king gathered\r\ntogether his people, and did not know whether or not he could offer any\r\nopposition to the enemy, who was superior in strength and had a mighty\r\narmy. Then said the gardener\xe2\x80\x99s boy: \xe2\x80\x98I am grown up, and will go to the\r\nwars also, only give me a horse.\xe2\x80\x99 The others laughed, and said: \xe2\x80\x98Seek\r\none for yourself when we are gone, we will leave one behind us in the\r\nstable for you.\xe2\x80\x99 When they had gone forth, he went into the stable, and\r\nled the horse out; it was lame of one foot, and limped hobblety jib,\r\nhobblety jib; nevertheless he mounted it, and rode away to the dark\r\nforest. When he came to the outskirts, he called \xe2\x80\x98Iron Hans\xe2\x80\x99 three\r\ntimes so loudly that it echoed through the trees. Thereupon the wild man\r\nappeared immediately, and said: \xe2\x80\x98What do you desire?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98I want a strong\r\nsteed, for I am going to the wars.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98That you shall have, and still more\r\nthan you ask for.\xe2\x80\x99 Then the wild man went back into the forest, and it\r\nwas not long before a stable-boy came out of it, who led a horse that\r\nsnorted with its nostrils, and could hardly be restrained, and behind\r\nthem followed a great troop of warriors entirely equipped in iron, and\r\ntheir swords flashed in the sun. The youth made over his three-legged\r\nhorse to the stable-boy, mounted the other, and rode at the head of the\r\nsoldiers. When he got near the battlefield a great part of the king\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmen had already fallen, and little was wanting to make the rest give\r\nway. Then the youth galloped thither with his iron soldiers, broke like\r\na hurricane over the enemy, and beat down all who opposed him. They\r\nbegan to flee, but the youth pursued, and never stopped, until there\r\nwas not a single man left. Instead of returning to the king, however, he\r\nconducted his troop by byways back to the forest, and called forth Iron\r\nHans. \xe2\x80\x98What do you desire?\xe2\x80\x99 asked the wild man. \xe2\x80\x98Take back your horse\r\nand your troops, and give me my three-legged horse again.\xe2\x80\x99 All that he\r\nasked was done, and soon he was riding on his three-legged horse. When\r\nthe king returned to his palace, his daughter went to meet him, and\r\nwished him joy of his victory. \xe2\x80\x98I am not the one who carried away the\r\nvictory,\xe2\x80\x99 said he, \xe2\x80\x98but a strange knight who came to my assistance with\r\nhis soldiers.\xe2\x80\x99 The daughter wanted to hear who the strange knight was,\r\nbut the king did not know, and said: \xe2\x80\x98He followed the enemy, and I did\r\nnot see him again.\xe2\x80\x99 She inquired of the gardener where his boy was, but\r\nhe smiled, and said: \xe2\x80\x98He has just come home on his three-legged horse,\r\nand the others have been mocking him, and crying: \xe2\x80\x9cHere comes our\r\nhobblety jib back again!\xe2\x80\x9d They asked, too: \xe2\x80\x9cUnder what hedge have you\r\nbeen lying sleeping all the time?\xe2\x80\x9d So he said: \xe2\x80\x9cI did the best of all,\r\nand it would have gone badly without me.\xe2\x80\x9d And then he was still more\r\nridiculed.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe king said to his daughter: \xe2\x80\x98I will proclaim a great feast that shall\r\nlast for three days, and you shall throw a golden apple. Perhaps the\r\nunknown man will show himself.\xe2\x80\x99 When the feast was announced, the youth\r\nwent out to the forest, and called Iron Hans. \xe2\x80\x98What do you desire?\xe2\x80\x99\r\nasked he. \xe2\x80\x98That I may catch the king\xe2\x80\x99s daughter\xe2\x80\x99s golden apple.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98It is\r\nas safe as if you had it already,\xe2\x80\x99 said Iron Hans. \xe2\x80\x98You shall likewise\r\nhave a suit of red armour for the occasion, and ride on a spirited\r\nchestnut-horse.\xe2\x80\x99 When the day came, the youth galloped to the spot, took\r\nhis place amongst the knights, and was recognized by no one. The king\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndaughter came forward, and threw a golden apple to the knights, but none\r\nof them caught it but he, only as soon as he had it he galloped away.\r\n\r\nOn the second day Iron Hans equipped him as a white knight, and gave him\r\na white horse. Again he was the only one who caught the apple, and\r\nhe did not linger an instant, but galloped off with it. The king grew\r\nangry, and said: \xe2\x80\x98That is not allowed; he must appear before me and tell\r\nhis name.\xe2\x80\x99 He gave the order that if the knight who caught the apple,\r\nshould go away again they should pursue him, and if he would not come\r\nback willingly, they were to cut him down and stab him.\r\n\r\nOn the third day, he received from Iron Hans a suit of black armour and\r\na black horse, and again he caught the apple. But when he was riding off\r\nwith it, the king\xe2\x80\x99s attendants pursued him, and one of them got so near\r\nhim that he wounded the youth\xe2\x80\x99s leg with the point of his sword. The\r\nyouth nevertheless escaped from them, but his horse leapt so violently\r\nthat the helmet fell from the youth\xe2\x80\x99s head, and they could see that he\r\nhad golden hair. They rode back and announced this to the king.\r\n\r\nThe following day the king\xe2\x80\x99s daughter asked the gardener about his\r\nboy. \xe2\x80\x98He is at work in the garden; the queer creature has been at the\r\nfestival too, and only came home yesterday evening; he has likewise\r\nshown my children three golden apples which he has won.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe king had him summoned into his presence, and he came and again had\r\nhis little cap on his head. But the king\xe2\x80\x99s daughter went up to him and\r\ntook it off, and then his golden hair fell down over his shoulders, and\r\nhe was so handsome that all were amazed. \xe2\x80\x98Are you the knight who came\r\nevery day to the festival, always in different colours, and who caught\r\nthe three golden apples?\xe2\x80\x99 asked the king. \xe2\x80\x98Yes,\xe2\x80\x99 answered he, \xe2\x80\x98and here\r\nthe apples are,\xe2\x80\x99 and he took them out of his pocket, and returned them\r\nto the king. \xe2\x80\x98If you desire further proof, you may see the wound which\r\nyour people gave me when they followed me. But I am likewise the knight\r\nwho helped you to your victory over your enemies.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98If you can perform\r\nsuch deeds as that, you are no gardener\xe2\x80\x99s boy; tell me, who is your\r\nfather?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98My father is a mighty king, and gold have I in plenty as great\r\nas I require.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98I well see,\xe2\x80\x99 said the king, \xe2\x80\x98that I owe my thanks to\r\nyou; can I do anything to please you?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Yes,\xe2\x80\x99 answered he, \xe2\x80\x98that indeed\r\nyou can. Give me your daughter to wife.\xe2\x80\x99 The maiden laughed, and said:\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He does not stand much on ceremony, but I have already seen by his\r\ngolden hair that he was no gardener\xe2\x80\x99s boy,\xe2\x80\x99 and then she went and\r\nkissed him. His father and mother came to the wedding, and were in great\r\ndelight, for they had given up all hope of ever seeing their dear\r\nson again. And as they were sitting at the marriage-feast, the music\r\nsuddenly stopped, the doors opened, and a stately king came in with a\r\ngreat retinue. He went up to the youth, embraced him and said: \xe2\x80\x98I am\r\nIron Hans, and was by enchantment a wild man, but you have set me free;\r\nall the treasures which I possess, shall be your property.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCAT-SKIN\r\n\r\nThere was once a king, whose queen had hair of the purest gold, and was\r\nso beautiful that her match was not to be met with on the whole face of\r\nthe earth. But this beautiful queen fell ill, and when she felt that her\r\nend drew near she called the king to her and said, \xe2\x80\x98Promise me that you\r\nwill never marry again, unless you meet with a wife who is as beautiful\r\nas I am, and who has golden hair like mine.\xe2\x80\x99 Then when the king in his\r\ngrief promised all she asked, she shut her eyes and died. But the king\r\nwas not to be comforted, and for a long time never thought of taking\r\nanother wife. At last, however, his wise men said, \xe2\x80\x98this will not do;\r\nthe king must marry again, that we may have a queen.\xe2\x80\x99 So messengers were\r\nsent far and wide, to seek for a bride as beautiful as the late queen.\r\nBut there was no princess in the world so beautiful; and if there had\r\nbeen, still there was not one to be found who had golden hair. So the\r\nmessengers came home, and had had all their trouble for nothing.\r\n\r\nNow the king had a daughter, who was just as beautiful as her mother,\r\nand had the same golden hair. And when she was grown up, the king looked\r\nat her and saw that she was just like this late queen: then he said to\r\nhis courtiers, \xe2\x80\x98May I not marry my daughter? She is the very image of my\r\ndead wife: unless I have her, I shall not find any bride upon the whole\r\nearth, and you say there must be a queen.\xe2\x80\x99 When the courtiers heard this\r\nthey were shocked, and said, \xe2\x80\x98Heaven forbid that a father should marry\r\nhis daughter! Out of so great a sin no good can come.\xe2\x80\x99 And his daughter\r\nwas also shocked, but hoped the king would soon give up such thoughts;\r\nso she said to him, \xe2\x80\x98Before I marry anyone I must have three dresses:\r\none must be of gold, like the sun; another must be of shining silver,\r\nlike the moon; and a third must be dazzling as the stars: besides this,\r\nI want a mantle of a thousand different kinds of fur put together, to\r\nwhich every beast in the kingdom must give a part of his skin.\xe2\x80\x99 And thus\r\nshe thought he would think of the matter no more. But the king made the\r\nmost skilful workmen in his kingdom weave the three dresses: one golden,\r\nlike the sun; another silvery, like the moon; and a third sparkling,\r\nlike the stars: and his hunters were told to hunt out all the beasts in\r\nhis kingdom, and to take the finest fur out of their skins: and thus a\r\nmantle of a thousand furs was made.\r\n\r\nWhen all were ready, the king sent them to her; but she got up in the\r\nnight when all were asleep, and took three of her trinkets, a golden\r\nring, a golden necklace, and a golden brooch, and packed the three\r\ndresses--of the sun, the moon, and the stars--up in a nutshell, and\r\nwrapped herself up in the mantle made of all sorts of fur, and besmeared\r\nher face and hands with soot. Then she threw herself upon Heaven for\r\nhelp in her need, and went away, and journeyed on the whole night, till\r\nat last she came to a large wood. As she was very tired, she sat herself\r\ndown in the hollow of a tree and soon fell asleep: and there she slept\r\non till it was midday.\r\n\r\nNow as the king to whom the wood belonged was hunting in it, his dogs\r\ncame to the tree, and began to snuff about, and run round and round, and\r\nbark. \xe2\x80\x98Look sharp!\xe2\x80\x99 said the king to the huntsmen, \xe2\x80\x98and see what sort\r\nof game lies there.\xe2\x80\x99 And the huntsmen went up to the tree, and when they\r\ncame back again said, \xe2\x80\x98In the hollow tree there lies a most wonderful\r\nbeast, such as we never saw before; its skin seems to be of a thousand\r\nkinds of fur, but there it lies fast asleep.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98See,\xe2\x80\x99 said the king, \xe2\x80\x98if\r\nyou can catch it alive, and we will take it with us.\xe2\x80\x99 So the huntsmen\r\ntook it up, and the maiden awoke and was greatly frightened, and said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am a poor child that has neither father nor mother left; have pity on\r\nme and take me with you.\xe2\x80\x99 Then they said, \xe2\x80\x98Yes, Miss Cat-skin, you will\r\ndo for the kitchen; you can sweep up the ashes, and do things of that\r\nsort.\xe2\x80\x99 So they put her into the coach, and took her home to the king\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npalace. Then they showed her a little corner under the staircase, where\r\nno light of day ever peeped in, and said, \xe2\x80\x98Cat-skin, you may lie and\r\nsleep there.\xe2\x80\x99 And she was sent into the kitchen, and made to fetch wood\r\nand water, to blow the fire, pluck the poultry, pick the herbs, sift the\r\nashes, and do all the dirty work.\r\n\r\nThus Cat-skin lived for a long time very sorrowfully. \xe2\x80\x98Ah! pretty\r\nprincess!\xe2\x80\x99 thought she, \xe2\x80\x98what will now become of thee?\xe2\x80\x99 But it happened\r\none day that a feast was to be held in the king\xe2\x80\x99s castle, so she said to\r\nthe cook, \xe2\x80\x98May I go up a little while and see what is going on? I will\r\ntake care and stand behind the door.\xe2\x80\x99 And the cook said, \xe2\x80\x98Yes, you may\r\ngo, but be back again in half an hour\xe2\x80\x99s time, to rake out the ashes.\xe2\x80\x99\r\nThen she took her little lamp, and went into her cabin, and took off the\r\nfur skin, and washed the soot from off her face and hands, so that her\r\nbeauty shone forth like the sun from behind the clouds. She next opened\r\nher nutshell, and brought out of it the dress that shone like the sun,\r\nand so went to the feast. Everyone made way for her, for nobody knew\r\nher, and they thought she could be no less than a king\xe2\x80\x99s daughter. But\r\nthe king came up to her, and held out his hand and danced with her; and\r\nhe thought in his heart, \xe2\x80\x98I never saw any one half so beautiful.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWhen the dance was at an end she curtsied; and when the king looked\r\nround for her, she was gone, no one knew wither. The guards that stood\r\nat the castle gate were called in: but they had seen no one. The truth\r\nwas, that she had run into her little cabin, pulled off her dress,\r\nblackened her face and hands, put on the fur-skin cloak, and was\r\nCat-skin again. When she went into the kitchen to her work, and began\r\nto rake the ashes, the cook said, \xe2\x80\x98Let that alone till the morning, and\r\nheat the king\xe2\x80\x99s soup; I should like to run up now and give a peep: but\r\ntake care you don\xe2\x80\x99t let a hair fall into it, or you will run a chance of\r\nnever eating again.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nAs soon as the cook went away, Cat-skin heated the king\xe2\x80\x99s soup, and\r\ntoasted a slice of bread first, as nicely as ever she could; and when it\r\nwas ready, she went and looked in the cabin for her little golden ring,\r\nand put it into the dish in which the soup was. When the dance was over,\r\nthe king ordered his soup to be brought in; and it pleased him so well,\r\nthat he thought he had never tasted any so good before. At the bottom\r\nhe saw a gold ring lying; and as he could not make out how it had got\r\nthere, he ordered the cook to be sent for. The cook was frightened when\r\nhe heard the order, and said to Cat-skin, \xe2\x80\x98You must have let a hair fall\r\ninto the soup; if it be so, you will have a good beating.\xe2\x80\x99 Then he went\r\nbefore the king, and he asked him who had cooked the soup. \xe2\x80\x98I did,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nanswered the cook. But the king said, \xe2\x80\x98That is not true; it was better\r\ndone than you could do it.\xe2\x80\x99 Then he answered, \xe2\x80\x98To tell the truth I did\r\nnot cook it, but Cat-skin did.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Then let Cat-skin come up,\xe2\x80\x99 said the\r\nking: and when she came he said to her, \xe2\x80\x98Who are you?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98I am a poor\r\nchild,\xe2\x80\x99 said she, \xe2\x80\x98that has lost both father and mother.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98How came you\r\nin my palace?\xe2\x80\x99 asked he. \xe2\x80\x98I am good for nothing,\xe2\x80\x99 said she, \xe2\x80\x98but to be\r\nscullion-girl, and to have boots and shoes thrown at my head.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98But how\r\ndid you get the ring that was in the soup?\xe2\x80\x99 asked the king. Then she\r\nwould not own that she knew anything about the ring; so the king sent\r\nher away again about her business.\r\n\r\nAfter a time there was another feast, and Cat-skin asked the cook to let\r\nher go up and see it as before. \xe2\x80\x98Yes,\xe2\x80\x99 said he, \xe2\x80\x98but come again in half\r\nan hour, and cook the king the soup that he likes so much.\xe2\x80\x99 Then she\r\nran to her little cabin, washed herself quickly, and took her dress\r\nout which was silvery as the moon, and put it on; and when she went in,\r\nlooking like a king\xe2\x80\x99s daughter, the king went up to her, and rejoiced at\r\nseeing her again, and when the dance began he danced with her. After the\r\ndance was at an end she managed to slip out, so slyly that the king did\r\nnot see where she was gone; but she sprang into her little cabin, and\r\nmade herself into Cat-skin again, and went into the kitchen to cook the\r\nsoup. Whilst the cook was above stairs, she got the golden necklace and\r\ndropped it into the soup; then it was brought to the king, who ate it,\r\nand it pleased him as well as before; so he sent for the cook, who\r\nwas again forced to tell him that Cat-skin had cooked it. Cat-skin was\r\nbrought again before the king, but she still told him that she was only\r\nfit to have boots and shoes thrown at her head.\r\n\r\nBut when the king had ordered a feast to be got ready for the third\r\ntime, it happened just the same as before. \xe2\x80\x98You must be a witch,\r\nCat-skin,\xe2\x80\x99 said the cook; \xe2\x80\x98for you always put something into your soup,\r\nso that it pleases the king better than mine.\xe2\x80\x99 However, he let her go up\r\nas before. Then she put on her dress which sparkled like the stars, and\r\nwent into the ball-room in it; and the king danced with her again, and\r\nthought she had never looked so beautiful as she did then. So whilst\r\nhe was dancing with her, he put a gold ring on her finger without her\r\nseeing it, and ordered that the dance should be kept up a long time.\r\nWhen it was at an end, he would have held her fast by the hand, but she\r\nslipped away, and sprang so quickly through the crowd that he lost sight\r\nof her: and she ran as fast as she could into her little cabin under\r\nthe stairs. But this time she kept away too long, and stayed beyond the\r\nhalf-hour; so she had not time to take off her fine dress, and threw her\r\nfur mantle over it, and in her haste did not blacken herself all over\r\nwith soot, but left one of her fingers white.\r\n\r\nThen she ran into the kitchen, and cooked the king\xe2\x80\x99s soup; and as soon\r\nas the cook was gone, she put the golden brooch into the dish. When the\r\nking got to the bottom, he ordered Cat-skin to be called once more, and\r\nsoon saw the white finger, and the ring that he had put on it whilst\r\nthey were dancing: so he seized her hand, and kept fast hold of it, and\r\nwhen she wanted to loose herself and spring away, the fur cloak fell off\r\na little on one side, and the starry dress sparkled underneath it.\r\n\r\nThen he got hold of the fur and tore it off, and her golden hair and\r\nbeautiful form were seen, and she could no longer hide herself: so she\r\nwashed the soot and ashes from her face, and showed herself to be the\r\nmost beautiful princess upon the face of the earth. But the king said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98You are my beloved bride, and we will never more be parted from each\r\nother.\xe2\x80\x99 And the wedding feast was held, and a merry day it was, as ever\r\nwas heard of or seen in that country, or indeed in any other.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSNOW-WHITE AND ROSE-RED\r\n\r\nThere was once a poor widow who lived in a lonely cottage. In front of\r\nthe cottage was a garden wherein stood two rose-trees, one of which bore\r\nwhite and the other red roses. She had two children who were like the\r\ntwo rose-trees, and one was called Snow-white, and the other Rose-red.\r\nThey were as good and happy, as busy and cheerful as ever two children\r\nin the world were, only Snow-white was more quiet and gentle than\r\nRose-red. Rose-red liked better to run about in the meadows and fields\r\nseeking flowers and catching butterflies; but Snow-white sat at home\r\nwith her mother, and helped her with her housework, or read to her when\r\nthere was nothing to do.\r\n\r\nThe two children were so fond of one another that they always held each\r\nother by the hand when they went out together, and when Snow-white said:\r\n\xe2\x80\x98We will not leave each other,\xe2\x80\x99 Rose-red answered: \xe2\x80\x98Never so long as we\r\nlive,\xe2\x80\x99 and their mother would add: \xe2\x80\x98What one has she must share with the\r\nother.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThey often ran about the forest alone and gathered red berries, and no\r\nbeasts did them any harm, but came close to them trustfully. The little\r\nhare would eat a cabbage-leaf out of their hands, the roe grazed by\r\ntheir side, the stag leapt merrily by them, and the birds sat still upon\r\nthe boughs, and sang whatever they knew.\r\n\r\nNo mishap overtook them; if they had stayed too late in the forest, and\r\nnight came on, they laid themselves down near one another upon the moss,\r\nand slept until morning came, and their mother knew this and did not\r\nworry on their account.\r\n\r\nOnce when they had spent the night in the wood and the dawn had roused\r\nthem, they saw a beautiful child in a shining white dress sitting near\r\ntheir bed. He got up and looked quite kindly at them, but said nothing\r\nand went into the forest. And when they looked round they found that\r\nthey had been sleeping quite close to a precipice, and would certainly\r\nhave fallen into it in the darkness if they had gone only a few paces\r\nfurther. And their mother told them that it must have been the angel who\r\nwatches over good children.\r\n\r\nSnow-white and Rose-red kept their mother\xe2\x80\x99s little cottage so neat that\r\nit was a pleasure to look inside it. In the summer Rose-red took care\r\nof the house, and every morning laid a wreath of flowers by her mother\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbed before she awoke, in which was a rose from each tree. In the winter\r\nSnow-white lit the fire and hung the kettle on the hob. The kettle\r\nwas of brass and shone like gold, so brightly was it polished. In the\r\nevening, when the snowflakes fell, the mother said: \xe2\x80\x98Go, Snow-white, and\r\nbolt the door,\xe2\x80\x99 and then they sat round the hearth, and the mother took\r\nher spectacles and read aloud out of a large book, and the two girls\r\nlistened as they sat and spun. And close by them lay a lamb upon the\r\nfloor, and behind them upon a perch sat a white dove with its head\r\nhidden beneath its wings.\r\n\r\nOne evening, as they were thus sitting comfortably together, someone\r\nknocked at the door as if he wished to be let in. The mother said:\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Quick, Rose-red, open the door, it must be a traveller who is seeking\r\nshelter.\xe2\x80\x99 Rose-red went and pushed back the bolt, thinking that it was a\r\npoor man, but it was not; it was a bear that stretched his broad, black\r\nhead within the door.\r\n\r\nRose-red screamed and sprang back, the lamb bleated, the dove fluttered,\r\nand Snow-white hid herself behind her mother\xe2\x80\x99s bed. But the bear began\r\nto speak and said: \xe2\x80\x98Do not be afraid, I will do you no harm! I am\r\nhalf-frozen, and only want to warm myself a little beside you.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Poor bear,\xe2\x80\x99 said the mother, \xe2\x80\x98lie down by the fire, only take care that\r\nyou do not burn your coat.\xe2\x80\x99 Then she cried: \xe2\x80\x98Snow-white, Rose-red, come\r\nout, the bear will do you no harm, he means well.\xe2\x80\x99 So they both came\r\nout, and by-and-by the lamb and dove came nearer, and were not afraid\r\nof him. The bear said: \xe2\x80\x98Here, children, knock the snow out of my coat a\r\nlittle\xe2\x80\x99; so they brought the broom and swept the bear\xe2\x80\x99s hide clean;\r\nand he stretched himself by the fire and growled contentedly and\r\ncomfortably. It was not long before they grew quite at home, and played\r\ntricks with their clumsy guest. They tugged his hair with their hands,\r\nput their feet upon his back and rolled him about, or they took a\r\nhazel-switch and beat him, and when he growled they laughed. But the\r\nbear took it all in good part, only when they were too rough he called\r\nout: \xe2\x80\x98Leave me alive, children,\r\n\r\n  Snow-white, Rose-red,\r\n  Will you beat your wooer dead?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nWhen it was bed-time, and the others went to bed, the mother said to the\r\nbear: \xe2\x80\x98You can lie there by the hearth, and then you will be safe from\r\nthe cold and the bad weather.\xe2\x80\x99 As soon as day dawned the two children\r\nlet him out, and he trotted across the snow into the forest.\r\n\r\nHenceforth the bear came every evening at the same time, laid himself\r\ndown by the hearth, and let the children amuse themselves with him as\r\nmuch as they liked; and they got so used to him that the doors were\r\nnever fastened until their black friend had arrived.\r\n\r\nWhen spring had come and all outside was green, the bear said one\r\nmorning to Snow-white: \xe2\x80\x98Now I must go away, and cannot come back for the\r\nwhole summer.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Where are you going, then, dear bear?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Snow-white.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I must go into the forest and guard my treasures from the wicked\r\ndwarfs. In the winter, when the earth is frozen hard, they are obliged\r\nto stay below and cannot work their way through; but now, when the sun\r\nhas thawed and warmed the earth, they break through it, and come out to\r\npry and steal; and what once gets into their hands, and in their caves,\r\ndoes not easily see daylight again.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nSnow-white was quite sorry at his departure, and as she unbolted the\r\ndoor for him, and the bear was hurrying out, he caught against the bolt\r\nand a piece of his hairy coat was torn off, and it seemed to Snow-white\r\nas if she had seen gold shining through it, but she was not sure about\r\nit. The bear ran away quickly, and was soon out of sight behind the\r\ntrees.\r\n\r\nA short time afterwards the mother sent her children into the forest\r\nto get firewood. There they found a big tree which lay felled on the\r\nground, and close by the trunk something was jumping backwards and\r\nforwards in the grass, but they could not make out what it was. When\r\nthey came nearer they saw a dwarf with an old withered face and a\r\nsnow-white beard a yard long. The end of the beard was caught in a\r\ncrevice of the tree, and the little fellow was jumping about like a dog\r\ntied to a rope, and did not know what to do.\r\n\r\nHe glared at the girls with his fiery red eyes and cried: \xe2\x80\x98Why do you\r\nstand there? Can you not come here and help me?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98What are you up to,\r\nlittle man?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Rose-red. \xe2\x80\x98You stupid, prying goose!\xe2\x80\x99 answered the\r\ndwarf: \xe2\x80\x98I was going to split the tree to get a little wood for cooking.\r\nThe little bit of food that we people get is immediately burnt up with\r\nheavy logs; we do not swallow so much as you coarse, greedy folk. I had\r\njust driven the wedge safely in, and everything was going as I wished;\r\nbut the cursed wedge was too smooth and suddenly sprang out, and the\r\ntree closed so quickly that I could not pull out my beautiful white\r\nbeard; so now it is tight and I cannot get away, and the silly, sleek,\r\nmilk-faced things laugh! Ugh! how odious you are!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThe children tried very hard, but they could not pull the beard out, it\r\nwas caught too fast. \xe2\x80\x98I will run and fetch someone,\xe2\x80\x99 said Rose-red. \xe2\x80\x98You\r\nsenseless goose!\xe2\x80\x99 snarled the dwarf; \xe2\x80\x98why should you fetch someone? You\r\nare already two too many for me; can you not think of something better?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t be impatient,\xe2\x80\x99 said Snow-white, \xe2\x80\x98I will help you,\xe2\x80\x99 and she pulled\r\nher scissors out of her pocket, and cut off the end of the beard.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the dwarf felt himself free he laid hold of a bag which lay\r\namongst the roots of the tree, and which was full of gold, and lifted it\r\nup, grumbling to himself: \xe2\x80\x98Uncouth people, to cut off a piece of my fine\r\nbeard. Bad luck to you!\xe2\x80\x99 and then he swung the bag upon his back, and\r\nwent off without even once looking at the children.\r\n\r\nSome time afterwards Snow-white and Rose-red went to catch a dish\r\nof fish. As they came near the brook they saw something like a large\r\ngrasshopper jumping towards the water, as if it were going to leap in.\r\nThey ran to it and found it was the dwarf. \xe2\x80\x98Where are you going?\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nRose-red; \xe2\x80\x98you surely don\xe2\x80\x99t want to go into the water?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98I am not such\r\na fool!\xe2\x80\x99 cried the dwarf; \xe2\x80\x98don\xe2\x80\x99t you see that the accursed fish wants\r\nto pull me in?\xe2\x80\x99 The little man had been sitting there fishing, and\r\nunluckily the wind had tangled up his beard with the fishing-line; a\r\nmoment later a big fish made a bite and the feeble creature had not\r\nstrength to pull it out; the fish kept the upper hand and pulled the\r\ndwarf towards him. He held on to all the reeds and rushes, but it was of\r\nlittle good, for he was forced to follow the movements of the fish, and\r\nwas in urgent danger of being dragged into the water.\r\n\r\nThe girls came just in time; they held him fast and tried to free his\r\nbeard from the line, but all in vain, beard and line were entangled fast\r\ntogether. There was nothing to do but to bring out the scissors and cut\r\nthe beard, whereby a small part of it was lost. When the dwarf saw that\r\nhe screamed out: \xe2\x80\x98Is that civil, you toadstool, to disfigure a man\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nface? Was it not enough to clip off the end of my beard? Now you have\r\ncut off the best part of it. I cannot let myself be seen by my people.\r\nI wish you had been made to run the soles off your shoes!\xe2\x80\x99 Then he took\r\nout a sack of pearls which lay in the rushes, and without another word\r\nhe dragged it away and disappeared behind a stone.\r\n\r\nIt happened that soon afterwards the mother sent the two children to the\r\ntown to buy needles and thread, and laces and ribbons. The road led them\r\nacross a heath upon which huge pieces of rock lay strewn about. There\r\nthey noticed a large bird hovering in the air, flying slowly round and\r\nround above them; it sank lower and lower, and at last settled near a\r\nrock not far away. Immediately they heard a loud, piteous cry. They ran\r\nup and saw with horror that the eagle had seized their old acquaintance\r\nthe dwarf, and was going to carry him off.\r\n\r\nThe children, full of pity, at once took tight hold of the little man,\r\nand pulled against the eagle so long that at last he let his booty go.\r\nAs soon as the dwarf had recovered from his first fright he cried\r\nwith his shrill voice: \xe2\x80\x98Could you not have done it more carefully! You\r\ndragged at my brown coat so that it is all torn and full of holes, you\r\nclumsy creatures!\xe2\x80\x99 Then he took up a sack full of precious stones, and\r\nslipped away again under the rock into his hole. The girls, who by\r\nthis time were used to his ingratitude, went on their way and did their\r\nbusiness in town.\r\n\r\nAs they crossed the heath again on their way home they surprised the\r\ndwarf, who had emptied out his bag of precious stones in a clean spot,\r\nand had not thought that anyone would come there so late. The evening\r\nsun shone upon the brilliant stones; they glittered and sparkled with\r\nall colours so beautifully that the children stood still and stared\r\nat them. \xe2\x80\x98Why do you stand gaping there?\xe2\x80\x99 cried the dwarf, and his\r\nashen-grey face became copper-red with rage. He was still cursing when a\r\nloud growling was heard, and a black bear came trotting towards them out\r\nof the forest. The dwarf sprang up in a fright, but he could not reach\r\nhis cave, for the bear was already close. Then in the dread of his heart\r\nhe cried: \xe2\x80\x98Dear Mr Bear, spare me, I will give you all my treasures;\r\nlook, the beautiful jewels lying there! Grant me my life; what do you\r\nwant with such a slender little fellow as I? you would not feel me\r\nbetween your teeth. Come, take these two wicked girls, they are tender\r\nmorsels for you, fat as young quails; for mercy\xe2\x80\x99s sake eat them!\xe2\x80\x99 The\r\nbear took no heed of his words, but gave the wicked creature a single\r\nblow with his paw, and he did not move again.\r\n\r\nThe girls had run away, but the bear called to them: \xe2\x80\x98Snow-white and\r\nRose-red, do not be afraid; wait, I will come with you.\xe2\x80\x99 Then they\r\nrecognized his voice and waited, and when he came up to them suddenly\r\nhis bearskin fell off, and he stood there a handsome man, clothed all in\r\ngold. \xe2\x80\x98I am a king\xe2\x80\x99s son,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, \xe2\x80\x98and I was bewitched by that wicked\r\ndwarf, who had stolen my treasures; I have had to run about the forest\r\nas a savage bear until I was freed by his death. Now he has got his\r\nwell-deserved punishment.\r\n\r\nSnow-white was married to him, and Rose-red to his brother, and they\r\ndivided between them the great treasure which the dwarf had gathered\r\ntogether in his cave. The old mother lived peacefully and happily with\r\nher children for many years. She took the two rose-trees with her, and\r\nthey stood before her window, and every year bore the most beautiful\r\nroses, white and red.\r\n\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Brothers Grimm, Jacob (1785-1863) and Wilhelm (1786-1859), were born\r\nin Hanau, near Frankfurt, in the German state of Hesse. Throughout\r\ntheir lives they remained close friends, and both studied law at Marburg\r\nUniversity. Jacob was a pioneer in the study of German philology,\r\nand although Wilhelm\xe2\x80\x99s work was hampered by poor health the brothers\r\ncollaborated in the creation of a German dictionary, not completed until\r\na century after their deaths. But they were best (and universally) known\r\nfor the collection of over two hundred folk tales they made from oral\r\nsources and published in two volumes of \xe2\x80\x98Nursery and Household Tales\xe2\x80\x99 in\r\n1812 and 1814. Although their intention was to preserve such material as\r\npart of German cultural and literary history, and their collection was\r\nfirst published with scholarly notes and no illustration, the tales soon\r\ncame into the possession of young readers. This was in part due to Edgar\r\nTaylor, who made the first English translation in 1823, selecting about\r\nfifty stories \xe2\x80\x98with the amusement of some young friends principally in\r\nview.\xe2\x80\x99 They have been an essential ingredient of children\xe2\x80\x99s reading ever\r\nsince.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg\xe2\x80\x99s Grimms\xe2\x80\x99 Fairy Tales, by The Brothers Grimm\r\n\r\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK GRIMMS\xe2\x80\x99 FAIRY TALES ***\r\n\r\n***** This file should be named 2591-0.txt or 2591-0.zip *****\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/2/5/9/2591/\r\n\r\nProduced by Emma Dudding, John Bickers, and Dagny\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\r\nwill be renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\r\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\r\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\r\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\r\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n'

So, I called myself Pip, and came to be called Pip.\r\n\r\nI give Pirrip as my father\xe2\x80\x99s family name, on the authority of his\r\ntombstone and my sister,--Mrs. Joe Gargery, who married the blacksmith.\r\nAs I never saw my father or my mother, and never saw any likeness\r\nof either of them (for their days were long before the days of\r\nphotographs), my first fancies regarding what they were like were\r\nunreasonably derived from their tombstones. The shape of the letters on\r\nmy father\xe2\x80\x99s, gave me an odd idea that he was a square, stout, dark man,\r\nwith curly black hair. From the character and turn of the inscription,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlso Georgiana Wife of the Above,\xe2\x80\x9d I drew a childish conclusion that\r\nmy mother was freckled and sickly. To five little stone lozenges, each\r\nabout a foot and a half long, which were arranged in a neat row beside\r\ntheir grave, and were sacred to the memory of five little brothers of\r\nmine,--who gave up trying to get a living, exceedingly early in\r\nthat universal struggle,--I am indebted for a belief I religiously\r\nentertained that they had all been born on their backs with their hands\r\nin their trousers-pockets, and had never taken them out in this state of\r\nexistence.\r\n\r\nOurs was the marsh country, down by the river, within, as the river\r\nwound, twenty miles of the sea. My first most vivid and broad impression\r\nof the identity of things seems to me to have been gained on a memorable\r\nraw afternoon towards evening. At such a time I found out for certain\r\nthat this bleak place overgrown with nettles was the churchyard; and\r\nthat Philip Pirrip, late of this parish, and also Georgiana wife of the\r\nabove, were dead and buried; and that Alexander, Bartholomew, Abraham,\r\nTobias, and Roger, infant children of the aforesaid, were also dead\r\nand buried; and that the dark flat wilderness beyond the churchyard,\r\nintersected with dikes and mounds and gates, with scattered cattle\r\nfeeding on it, was the marshes; and that the low leaden line beyond\r\nwas the river; and that the distant savage lair from which the wind was\r\nrushing was the sea; and that the small bundle of shivers growing afraid\r\nof it all and beginning to cry, was Pip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHold your noise!\xe2\x80\x9d cried a terrible voice, as a man started up from\r\namong the graves at the side of the church porch. \xe2\x80\x9cKeep still, you\r\nlittle devil, or I\xe2\x80\x99ll cut your throat!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA fearful man, all in coarse gray, with a great iron on his leg. A man\r\nwith no hat, and with broken shoes, and with an old rag tied round his\r\nhead. A man who had been soaked in water, and smothered in mud, and\r\nlamed by stones, and cut by flints, and stung by nettles, and torn by\r\nbriars; who limped, and shivered, and glared, and growled; and whose\r\nteeth chattered in his head as he seized me by the chin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! Don\xe2\x80\x99t cut my throat, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d I pleaded in terror. \xe2\x80\x9cPray don\xe2\x80\x99t do it,\r\nsir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell us your name!\xe2\x80\x9d said the man. \xe2\x80\x9cQuick!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPip, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnce more,\xe2\x80\x9d said the man, staring at me. \xe2\x80\x9cGive it mouth!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPip. Pip, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShow us where you live,\xe2\x80\x9d said the man. \xe2\x80\x9cPint out the place!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI pointed to where our village lay, on the flat in-shore among the\r\nalder-trees and pollards, a mile or more from the church.\r\n\r\nThe man, after looking at me for a moment, turned me upside down, and\r\nemptied my pockets. There was nothing in them but a piece of bread. When\r\nthe church came to itself,--for he was so sudden and strong that he\r\nmade it go head over heels before me, and I saw the steeple under my\r\nfeet,--when the church came to itself, I say, I was seated on a high\r\ntombstone, trembling while he ate the bread ravenously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou young dog,\xe2\x80\x9d said the man, licking his lips, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat fat cheeks you\r\nha\xe2\x80\x99 got.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI believe they were fat, though I was at that time undersized for my\r\nyears, and not strong.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDarn me if I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t eat em,\xe2\x80\x9d said the man, with a threatening shake\r\nof his head, \xe2\x80\x9cand if I han\xe2\x80\x99t half a mind to\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI earnestly expressed my hope that he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t, and held tighter to\r\nthe tombstone on which he had put me; partly, to keep myself upon it;\r\npartly, to keep myself from crying.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow lookee here!\xe2\x80\x9d said the man. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere\xe2\x80\x99s your mother?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere, sir!\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\nHe started, made a short run, and stopped and looked over his shoulder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere, sir!\xe2\x80\x9d I timidly explained. \xe2\x80\x9cAlso Georgiana. That\xe2\x80\x99s my mother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d said he, coming back. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd is that your father alonger your\r\nmother?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said I; \xe2\x80\x9chim too; late of this parish.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHa!\xe2\x80\x9d he muttered then, considering. \xe2\x80\x9cWho d\xe2\x80\x99ye live with,--supposin\xe2\x80\x99\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99re kindly let to live, which I han\xe2\x80\x99t made up my mind about?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy sister, sir,--Mrs. Joe Gargery,--wife of Joe Gargery, the\r\nblacksmith, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBlacksmith, eh?\xe2\x80\x9d said he. And looked down at his leg.\r\n\r\nAfter darkly looking at his leg and me several times, he came closer\r\nto my tombstone, took me by both arms, and tilted me back as far as he\r\ncould hold me; so that his eyes looked most powerfully down into mine,\r\nand mine looked most helplessly up into his.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow lookee here,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cthe question being whether you\xe2\x80\x99re to be let\r\nto live. You know what a file is?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you know what wittles is?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter each question he tilted me over a little more, so as to give me a\r\ngreater sense of helplessness and danger.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou get me a file.\xe2\x80\x9d He tilted me again. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd you get me wittles.\xe2\x80\x9d He\r\ntilted me again. \xe2\x80\x9cYou bring \xe2\x80\x98em both to me.\xe2\x80\x9d He tilted me again. \xe2\x80\x9cOr\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll have your heart and liver out.\xe2\x80\x9d He tilted me again.\r\n\r\nI was dreadfully frightened, and so giddy that I clung to him with both\r\nhands, and said, \xe2\x80\x9cIf you would kindly please to let me keep upright,\r\nsir, perhaps I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be sick, and perhaps I could attend more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe gave me a most tremendous dip and roll, so that the church jumped\r\nover its own weathercock. Then, he held me by the arms, in an upright\r\nposition on the top of the stone, and went on in these fearful terms:--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou bring me, to-morrow morning early, that file and them wittles. You\r\nbring the lot to me, at that old Battery over yonder. You do it, and you\r\nnever dare to say a word or dare to make a sign concerning your having\r\nseen such a person as me, or any person sumever, and you shall be let to\r\nlive. You fail, or you go from my words in any partickler, no matter how\r\nsmall it is, and your heart and your liver shall be tore out, roasted,\r\nand ate. Now, I ain\xe2\x80\x99t alone, as you may think I am. There\xe2\x80\x99s a young man\r\nhid with me, in comparison with which young man I am a Angel. That young\r\nman hears the words I speak. That young man has a secret way pecooliar\r\nto himself, of getting at a boy, and at his heart, and at his liver. It\r\nis in wain for a boy to attempt to hide himself from that young man. A\r\nboy may lock his door, may be warm in bed, may tuck himself up, may draw\r\nthe clothes over his head, may think himself comfortable and safe, but\r\nthat young man will softly creep and creep his way to him and tear him\r\nopen. I am a keeping that young man from harming of you at the present\r\nmoment, with great difficulty. I find it wery hard to hold that young\r\nman off of your inside. Now, what do you say?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI said that I would get him the file, and I would get him what broken\r\nbits of food I could, and I would come to him at the Battery, early in\r\nthe morning.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSay Lord strike you dead if you don\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x9d said the man.\r\n\r\nI said so, and he took me down.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow,\xe2\x80\x9d he pursued, \xe2\x80\x9cyou remember what you\xe2\x80\x99ve undertook, and you remember\r\nthat young man, and you get home!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGoo-good night, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d I faltered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMuch of that!\xe2\x80\x9d said he, glancing about him over the cold wet flat. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nwish I was a frog. Or a eel!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt the same time, he hugged his shuddering body in both his\r\narms,--clasping himself, as if to hold himself together,--and limped\r\ntowards the low church wall. As I saw him go, picking his way among the\r\nnettles, and among the brambles that bound the green mounds, he looked\r\nin my young eyes as if he were eluding the hands of the dead people,\r\nstretching up cautiously out of their graves, to get a twist upon his\r\nankle and pull him in.\r\n\r\nWhen he came to the low church wall, he got over it, like a man whose\r\nlegs were numbed and stiff, and then turned round to look for me. When I\r\nsaw him turning, I set my face towards home, and made the best use of\r\nmy legs. But presently I looked over my shoulder, and saw him going on\r\nagain towards the river, still hugging himself in both arms, and picking\r\nhis way with his sore feet among the great stones dropped into the\r\nmarshes here and there, for stepping-places when the rains were heavy or\r\nthe tide was in.\r\n\r\nThe marshes were just a long black horizontal line then, as I stopped\r\nto look after him; and the river was just another horizontal line, not\r\nnearly so broad nor yet so black; and the sky was just a row of long\r\nangry red lines and dense black lines intermixed. On the edge of the\r\nriver I could faintly make out the only two black things in all the\r\nprospect that seemed to be standing upright; one of these was the beacon\r\nby which the sailors steered,--like an unhooped cask upon a pole,--an\r\nugly thing when you were near it; the other, a gibbet, with some chains\r\nhanging to it which had once held a pirate. The man was limping on\r\ntowards this latter, as if he were the pirate come to life, and come\r\ndown, and going back to hook himself up again. It gave me a terrible\r\nturn when I thought so; and as I saw the cattle lifting their heads to\r\ngaze after him, I wondered whether they thought so too. I looked all\r\nround for the horrible young man, and could see no signs of him. But now\r\nI was frightened again, and ran home without stopping.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter II\r\n\r\nMy sister, Mrs. Joe Gargery, was more than twenty years older than I,\r\nand had established a great reputation with herself and the neighbors\r\nbecause she had brought me up \xe2\x80\x9cby hand.\xe2\x80\x9d Having at that time to find out\r\nfor myself what the expression meant, and knowing her to have a hard and\r\nheavy hand, and to be much in the habit of laying it upon her husband as\r\nwell as upon me, I supposed that Joe Gargery and I were both brought up\r\nby hand.\r\n\r\nShe was not a good-looking woman, my sister; and I had a general\r\nimpression that she must have made Joe Gargery marry her by hand. Joe\r\nwas a fair man, with curls of flaxen hair on each side of his smooth\r\nface, and with eyes of such a very undecided blue that they seemed\r\nto have somehow got mixed with their own whites. He was a mild,\r\ngood-natured, sweet-tempered, easy-going, foolish, dear fellow,--a sort\r\nof Hercules in strength, and also in weakness.\r\n\r\nMy sister, Mrs. Joe, with black hair and eyes, had such a prevailing\r\nredness of skin that I sometimes used to wonder whether it was possible\r\nshe washed herself with a nutmeg-grater instead of soap. She was tall\r\nand bony, and almost always wore a coarse apron, fastened over her\r\nfigure behind with two loops, and having a square impregnable bib in\r\nfront, that was stuck full of pins and needles. She made it a powerful\r\nmerit in herself, and a strong reproach against Joe, that she wore this\r\napron so much. Though I really see no reason why she should have worn it\r\nat all; or why, if she did wear it at all, she should not have taken it\r\noff, every day of her life.\r\n\r\nJoe\xe2\x80\x99s forge adjoined our house, which was a wooden house, as many of the\r\ndwellings in our country were,--most of them, at that time. When I ran\r\nhome from the churchyard, the forge was shut up, and Joe was sitting\r\nalone in the kitchen. Joe and I being fellow-sufferers, and having\r\nconfidences as such, Joe imparted a confidence to me, the moment I\r\nraised the latch of the door and peeped in at him opposite to it,\r\nsitting in the chimney corner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Joe has been out a dozen times, looking for you, Pip. And she\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nout now, making it a baker\xe2\x80\x99s dozen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs she?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Pip,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe; \xe2\x80\x9cand what\xe2\x80\x99s worse, she\xe2\x80\x99s got Tickler with her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt this dismal intelligence, I twisted the only button on my waistcoat\r\nround and round, and looked in great depression at the fire. Tickler\r\nwas a wax-ended piece of cane, worn smooth by collision with my tickled\r\nframe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe sot down,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe, \xe2\x80\x9cand she got up, and she made a grab at\r\nTickler, and she Ram-paged out. That\xe2\x80\x99s what she did,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe, slowly\r\nclearing the fire between the lower bars with the poker, and looking at\r\nit; \xe2\x80\x9cshe Ram-paged out, Pip.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHas she been gone long, Joe?\xe2\x80\x9d I always treated him as a larger species\r\nof child, and as no more than my equal.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe, glancing up at the Dutch clock, \xe2\x80\x9cshe\xe2\x80\x99s been on the\r\nRam-page, this last spell, about five minutes, Pip. She\xe2\x80\x99s a coming! Get\r\nbehind the door, old chap, and have the jack-towel betwixt you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI took the advice. My sister, Mrs. Joe, throwing the door wide open,\r\nand finding an obstruction behind it, immediately divined the cause, and\r\napplied Tickler to its further investigation. She concluded by throwing\r\nme--I often served as a connubial missile--at Joe, who, glad to get hold\r\nof me on any terms, passed me on into the chimney and quietly fenced me\r\nup there with his great leg.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere have you been, you young monkey?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Joe, stamping her\r\nfoot. \xe2\x80\x9cTell me directly what you\xe2\x80\x99ve been doing to wear me away with fret\r\nand fright and worrit, or I\xe2\x80\x99d have you out of that corner if you was\r\nfifty Pips, and he was five hundred Gargerys.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have only been to the churchyard,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, from my stool, crying and\r\nrubbing myself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cChurchyard!\xe2\x80\x9d repeated my sister. \xe2\x80\x9cIf it warn\xe2\x80\x99t for me you\xe2\x80\x99d have been\r\nto the churchyard long ago, and stayed there. Who brought you up by\r\nhand?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou did,\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd why did I do it, I should like to know?\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed my sister.\r\n\r\nI whimpered, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t!\xe2\x80\x9d said my sister. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d never do it again! I know that. I may\r\ntruly say I\xe2\x80\x99ve never had this apron of mine off since born you were.\r\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s bad enough to be a blacksmith\xe2\x80\x99s wife (and him a Gargery) without\r\nbeing your mother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMy thoughts strayed from that question as I looked disconsolately at\r\nthe fire. For the fugitive out on the marshes with the ironed leg, the\r\nmysterious young man, the file, the food, and the dreadful pledge I was\r\nunder to commit a larceny on those sheltering premises, rose before me\r\nin the avenging coals.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHah!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Joe, restoring Tickler to his station. \xe2\x80\x9cChurchyard,\r\nindeed! You may well say churchyard, you two.\xe2\x80\x9d One of us, by the by, had\r\nnot said it at all. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll drive me to the churchyard betwixt you, one\r\nof these days, and O, a pr-r-recious pair you\xe2\x80\x99d be without me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs she applied herself to set the tea-things, Joe peeped down at me\r\nover his leg, as if he were mentally casting me and himself up, and\r\ncalculating what kind of pair we practically should make, under the\r\ngrievous circumstances foreshadowed. After that, he sat feeling his\r\nright-side flaxen curls and whisker, and following Mrs. Joe about with\r\nhis blue eyes, as his manner always was at squally times.\r\n\r\nMy sister had a trenchant way of cutting our bread and butter for us,\r\nthat never varied. First, with her left hand she jammed the loaf hard\r\nand fast against her bib,--where it sometimes got a pin into it, and\r\nsometimes a needle, which we afterwards got into our mouths. Then she\r\ntook some butter (not too much) on a knife and spread it on the loaf, in\r\nan apothecary kind of way, as if she were making a plaster,--using both\r\nsides of the knife with a slapping dexterity, and trimming and moulding\r\nthe butter off round the crust. Then, she gave the knife a final smart\r\nwipe on the edge of the plaster, and then sawed a very thick round off\r\nthe loaf: which she finally, before separating from the loaf, hewed into\r\ntwo halves, of which Joe got one, and I the other.\r\n\r\nOn the present occasion, though I was hungry, I dared not eat my\r\nslice. I felt that I must have something in reserve for my dreadful\r\nacquaintance, and his ally the still more dreadful young man. I knew\r\nMrs. Joe\xe2\x80\x99s housekeeping to be of the strictest kind, and that my\r\nlarcenous researches might find nothing available in the safe. Therefore\r\nI resolved to put my hunk of bread and butter down the leg of my\r\ntrousers.\r\n\r\nThe effort of resolution necessary to the achievement of this purpose I\r\nfound to be quite awful. It was as if I had to make up my mind to leap\r\nfrom the top of a high house, or plunge into a great depth of water.\r\nAnd it was made the more difficult by the unconscious Joe. In\r\nour already-mentioned freemasonry as fellow-sufferers, and in his\r\ngood-natured companionship with me, it was our evening habit to compare\r\nthe way we bit through our slices, by silently holding them up to each\r\nother\xe2\x80\x99s admiration now and then,--which stimulated us to new exertions.\r\nTo-night, Joe several times invited me, by the display of his fast\r\ndiminishing slice, to enter upon our usual friendly competition; but\r\nhe found me, each time, with my yellow mug of tea on one knee, and\r\nmy untouched bread and butter on the other. At last, I desperately\r\nconsidered that the thing I contemplated must be done, and that it\r\nhad best be done in the least improbable manner consistent with the\r\ncircumstances. I took advantage of a moment when Joe had just looked at\r\nme, and got my bread and butter down my leg.\r\n\r\nJoe was evidently made uncomfortable by what he supposed to be my loss\r\nof appetite, and took a thoughtful bite out of his slice, which he\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to enjoy. He turned it about in his mouth much longer than\r\nusual, pondering over it a good deal, and after all gulped it down like\r\na pill. He was about to take another bite, and had just got his head on\r\none side for a good purchase on it, when his eye fell on me, and he saw\r\nthat my bread and butter was gone.\r\n\r\nThe wonder and consternation with which Joe stopped on the threshold\r\nof his bite and stared at me, were too evident to escape my sister\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nobservation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the matter now?\xe2\x80\x9d said she, smartly, as she put down her cup.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say, you know!\xe2\x80\x9d muttered Joe, shaking his head at me in very serious\r\nremonstrance. \xe2\x80\x9cPip, old chap! You\xe2\x80\x99ll do yourself a mischief. It\xe2\x80\x99ll stick\r\nsomewhere. You can\xe2\x80\x99t have chawed it, Pip.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the matter now?\xe2\x80\x9d repeated my sister, more sharply than before.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you can cough any trifle on it up, Pip, I\xe2\x80\x99d recommend you to do it,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n said Joe, all aghast. \xe2\x80\x9cManners is manners, but still your elth\xe2\x80\x99s your\r\nelth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBy this time, my sister was quite desperate, so she pounced on Joe,\r\nand, taking him by the two whiskers, knocked his head for a little while\r\nagainst the wall behind him, while I sat in the corner, looking guiltily\r\non.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, perhaps you\xe2\x80\x99ll mention what\xe2\x80\x99s the matter,\xe2\x80\x9d said my sister, out of\r\nbreath, \xe2\x80\x9cyou staring great stuck pig.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJoe looked at her in a helpless way, then took a helpless bite, and\r\nlooked at me again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know, Pip,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe, solemnly, with his last bite in his cheek,\r\nand speaking in a confidential voice, as if we two were quite alone,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cyou and me is always friends, and I\xe2\x80\x99d be the last to tell upon you,\r\nany time. But such a--\xe2\x80\x9d he moved his chair and looked about the floor\r\nbetween us, and then again at me--\xe2\x80\x9csuch a most oncommon Bolt as that!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBeen bolting his food, has he?\xe2\x80\x9d cried my sister.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know, old chap,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe, looking at me, and not at Mrs. Joe,\r\nwith his bite still in his cheek, \xe2\x80\x9cI Bolted, myself, when I was your\r\nage--frequent--and as a boy I\xe2\x80\x99ve been among a many Bolters; but I never\r\nsee your Bolting equal yet, Pip, and it\xe2\x80\x99s a mercy you ain\xe2\x80\x99t Bolted\r\ndead.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMy sister made a dive at me, and fished me up by the hair, saying\r\nnothing more than the awful words, \xe2\x80\x9cYou come along and be dosed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSome medical beast had revived Tar-water in those days as a fine\r\nmedicine, and Mrs. Joe always kept a supply of it in the cupboard;\r\nhaving a belief in its virtues correspondent to its nastiness. At the\r\nbest of times, so much of this elixir was administered to me as a choice\r\nrestorative, that I was conscious of going about, smelling like a new\r\nfence. On this particular evening the urgency of my case demanded a\r\npint of this mixture, which was poured down my throat, for my greater\r\ncomfort, while Mrs. Joe held my head under her arm, as a boot would\r\nbe held in a bootjack. Joe got off with half a pint; but was made to\r\nswallow that (much to his disturbance, as he sat slowly munching and\r\nmeditating before the fire), \xe2\x80\x9cbecause he had had a turn.\xe2\x80\x9d Judging from\r\nmyself, I should say he certainly had a turn afterwards, if he had had\r\nnone before.\r\n\r\nConscience is a dreadful thing when it accuses man or boy; but when, in\r\nthe case of a boy, that secret burden co-operates with another secret\r\nburden down the leg of his trousers, it is (as I can testify) a great\r\npunishment. The guilty knowledge that I was going to rob Mrs. Joe--I\r\nnever thought I was going to rob Joe, for I never thought of any of the\r\nhousekeeping property as his--united to the necessity of always keeping\r\none hand on my bread and butter as I sat, or when I was ordered about\r\nthe kitchen on any small errand, almost drove me out of my mind. Then,\r\nas the marsh winds made the fire glow and flare, I thought I heard the\r\nvoice outside, of the man with the iron on his leg who had sworn me to\r\nsecrecy, declaring that he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t and wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t starve until to-morrow,\r\nbut must be fed now. At other times, I thought, What if the young man\r\nwho was with so much difficulty restrained from imbruing his hands in me\r\nshould yield to a constitutional impatience, or should mistake the time,\r\nand should think himself accredited to my heart and liver to-night,\r\ninstead of to-morrow! If ever anybody\xe2\x80\x99s hair stood on end with terror,\r\nmine must have done so then. But, perhaps, nobody\xe2\x80\x99s ever did?\r\n\r\nIt was Christmas Eve, and I had to stir the pudding for next day, with\r\na copper-stick, from seven to eight by the Dutch clock. I tried it with\r\nthe load upon my leg (and that made me think afresh of the man with the\r\nload on HIS leg), and found the tendency of exercise to bring the bread\r\nand butter out at my ankle, quite unmanageable. Happily I slipped away,\r\nand deposited that part of my conscience in my garret bedroom.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHark!\xe2\x80\x9d said I, when I had done my stirring, and was taking a final warm\r\nin the chimney corner before being sent up to bed; \xe2\x80\x9cwas that great guns,\r\nJoe?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s another conwict off.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat does that mean, Joe?\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\nMrs. Joe, who always took explanations upon herself, said, snappishly,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEscaped. Escaped.\xe2\x80\x9d Administering the definition like Tar-water.\r\n\r\nWhile Mrs. Joe sat with her head bending over her needlework, I put my\r\nmouth into the forms of saying to Joe, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s a convict?\xe2\x80\x9d Joe put his\r\nmouth into the forms of returning such a highly elaborate answer, that I\r\ncould make out nothing of it but the single word \xe2\x80\x9cPip.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere was a conwict off last night,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe, aloud, \xe2\x80\x9cafter\r\nsunset-gun. And they fired warning of him. And now it appears they\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nfiring warning of another.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho\xe2\x80\x99s firing?\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDrat that boy,\xe2\x80\x9d interposed my sister, frowning at me over her work,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwhat a questioner he is. Ask no questions, and you\xe2\x80\x99ll be told no lies.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was not very polite to herself, I thought, to imply that I should be\r\ntold lies by her even if I did ask questions. But she never was polite\r\nunless there was company.\r\n\r\nAt this point Joe greatly augmented my curiosity by taking the utmost\r\npains to open his mouth very wide, and to put it into the form of a word\r\nthat looked to me like \xe2\x80\x9csulks.\xe2\x80\x9d Therefore, I naturally pointed to Mrs.\r\nJoe, and put my mouth into the form of saying, \xe2\x80\x9cher?\xe2\x80\x9d But Joe wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nhear of that, at all, and again opened his mouth very wide, and shook\r\nthe form of a most emphatic word out of it. But I could make nothing of\r\nthe word.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Joe,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, as a last resort, \xe2\x80\x9cI should like to know--if you\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t much mind--where the firing comes from?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLord bless the boy!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed my sister, as if she didn\xe2\x80\x99t quite mean\r\nthat but rather the contrary. \xe2\x80\x9cFrom the Hulks!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh-h!\xe2\x80\x9d said I, looking at Joe. \xe2\x80\x9cHulks!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJoe gave a reproachful cough, as much as to say, \xe2\x80\x9cWell, I told you so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd please, what\xe2\x80\x99s Hulks?\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s the way with this boy!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed my sister, pointing me out\r\nwith her needle and thread, and shaking her head at me. \xe2\x80\x9cAnswer him one\r\nquestion, and he\xe2\x80\x99ll ask you a dozen directly. Hulks are prison-ships,\r\nright \xe2\x80\x98cross th\xe2\x80\x99 meshes.\xe2\x80\x9d We always used that name for marshes, in our\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wonder who\xe2\x80\x99s put into prison-ships, and why they\xe2\x80\x99re put there?\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nI, in a general way, and with quiet desperation.\r\n\r\nIt was too much for Mrs. Joe, who immediately rose. \xe2\x80\x9cI tell you what,\r\nyoung fellow,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, \xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t bring you up by hand to badger\r\npeople\xe2\x80\x99s lives out. It would be blame to me and not praise, if I had.\r\nPeople are put in the Hulks because they murder, and because they rob,\r\nand forge, and do all sorts of bad; and they always begin by asking\r\nquestions. Now, you get along to bed!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI was never allowed a candle to light me to bed, and, as I went upstairs\r\nin the dark, with my head tingling,--from Mrs. Joe\xe2\x80\x99s thimble\r\nhaving played the tambourine upon it, to accompany her last words,--I\r\nfelt fearfully sensible of the great convenience that the hulks were\r\nhandy for me. I was clearly on my way there. I had begun by asking\r\nquestions, and I was going to rob Mrs. Joe.\r\n\r\nSince that time, which is far enough away now, I have often thought\r\nthat few people know what secrecy there is in the young under terror.\r\nNo matter how unreasonable the terror, so that it be terror. I was in\r\nmortal terror of the young man who wanted my heart and liver; I was\r\nin mortal terror of my interlocutor with the iron leg; I was in mortal\r\nterror of myself, from whom an awful promise had been extracted; I had\r\nno hope of deliverance through my all-powerful sister, who repulsed\r\nme at every turn; I am afraid to think of what I might have done on\r\nrequirement, in the secrecy of my terror.\r\n\r\nIf I slept at all that night, it was only to imagine myself drifting\r\ndown the river on a strong spring-tide, to the Hulks; a ghostly\r\npirate calling out to me through a speaking-trumpet, as I passed the\r\ngibbet-station, that I had better come ashore and be hanged there at\r\nonce, and not put it off. I was afraid to sleep, even if I had been\r\ninclined, for I knew that at the first faint dawn of morning I must rob\r\nthe pantry. There was no doing it in the night, for there was no getting\r\na light by easy friction then; to have got one I must have struck it out\r\nof flint and steel, and have made a noise like the very pirate himself\r\nrattling his chains.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the great black velvet pall outside my little window was shot\r\nwith gray, I got up and went downstairs; every board upon the way, and\r\nevery crack in every board calling after me, \xe2\x80\x9cStop thief!\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cGet up,\r\nMrs. Joe!\xe2\x80\x9d In the pantry, which was far more abundantly supplied than\r\nusual, owing to the season, I was very much alarmed by a hare hanging\r\nup by the heels, whom I rather thought I caught, when my back was half\r\nturned, winking. I had no time for verification, no time for selection,\r\nno time for anything, for I had no time to spare. I stole some bread,\r\nsome rind of cheese, about half a jar of mincemeat (which I tied up in\r\nmy pocket-handkerchief with my last night\xe2\x80\x99s slice), some brandy from a\r\nstone bottle (which I decanted into a glass bottle I had secretly used\r\nfor making that intoxicating fluid, Spanish-liquorice-water, up in my\r\nroom: diluting the stone bottle from a jug in the kitchen cupboard),\r\na meat bone with very little on it, and a beautiful round compact pork\r\npie. I was nearly going away without the pie, but I was tempted to mount\r\nupon a shelf, to look what it was that was put away so carefully in a\r\ncovered earthenware dish in a corner, and I found it was the pie, and\r\nI took it in the hope that it was not intended for early use, and would\r\nnot be missed for some time.\r\n\r\nThere was a door in the kitchen, communicating with the forge; I\r\nunlocked and unbolted that door, and got a file from among Joe\xe2\x80\x99s tools.\r\nThen I put the fastenings as I had found them, opened the door at which\r\nI had entered when I ran home last night, shut it, and ran for the misty\r\nmarshes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter III\r\n\r\nIt was a rimy morning, and very damp. I had seen the damp lying on the\r\noutside of my little window, as if some goblin had been crying there all\r\nnight, and using the window for a pocket-handkerchief. Now, I saw the\r\ndamp lying on the bare hedges and spare grass, like a coarser sort of\r\nspiders\xe2\x80\x99 webs; hanging itself from twig to twig and blade to blade. On\r\nevery rail and gate, wet lay clammy, and the marsh mist was so thick,\r\nthat the wooden finger on the post directing people to our village--a\r\ndirection which they never accepted, for they never came there--was\r\ninvisible to me until I was quite close under it. Then, as I looked up\r\nat it, while it dripped, it seemed to my oppressed conscience like a\r\nphantom devoting me to the Hulks.\r\n\r\nThe mist was heavier yet when I got out upon the marshes, so that\r\ninstead of my running at everything, everything seemed to run at me.\r\nThis was very disagreeable to a guilty mind. The gates and dikes and\r\nbanks came bursting at me through the mist, as if they cried as plainly\r\nas could be, \xe2\x80\x9cA boy with somebody else\xe2\x80\x99s pork pie! Stop him!\xe2\x80\x9d The\r\ncattle came upon me with like suddenness, staring out of their eyes,\r\nand steaming out of their nostrils, \xe2\x80\x9cHalloa, young thief!\xe2\x80\x9d One black\r\nox, with a white cravat on,--who even had to my awakened conscience\r\nsomething of a clerical air,--fixed me so obstinately with his eyes,\r\nand moved his blunt head round in such an accusatory manner as I moved\r\nround, that I blubbered out to him, \xe2\x80\x9cI couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help it, sir! It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nfor myself I took it!\xe2\x80\x9d Upon which he put down his head, blew a cloud of\r\nsmoke out of his nose, and vanished with a kick-up of his hind-legs and\r\na flourish of his tail.\r\n\r\nAll this time, I was getting on towards the river; but however fast I\r\nwent, I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t warm my feet, to which the damp cold seemed riveted, as\r\nthe iron was riveted to the leg of the man I was running to meet. I knew\r\nmy way to the Battery, pretty straight, for I had been down there on a\r\nSunday with Joe, and Joe, sitting on an old gun, had told me that when\r\nI was \xe2\x80\x98prentice to him, regularly bound, we would have such Larks there!\r\nHowever, in the confusion of the mist, I found myself at last too far to\r\nthe right, and consequently had to try back along the river-side, on the\r\nbank of loose stones above the mud and the stakes that staked the tide\r\nout. Making my way along here with all despatch, I had just crossed a\r\nditch which I knew to be very near the Battery, and had just scrambled\r\nup the mound beyond the ditch, when I saw the man sitting before me.\r\nHis back was towards me, and he had his arms folded, and was nodding\r\nforward, heavy with sleep.\r\n\r\nI thought he would be more glad if I came upon him with his breakfast,\r\nin that unexpected manner, so I went forward softly and touched him on\r\nthe shoulder. He instantly jumped up, and it was not the same man, but\r\nanother man!\r\n\r\nAnd yet this man was dressed in coarse gray, too, and had a great iron\r\non his leg, and was lame, and hoarse, and cold, and was everything that\r\nthe other man was; except that he had not the same face, and had a flat\r\nbroad-brimmed low-crowned felt hat on. All this I saw in a moment, for\r\nI had only a moment to see it in: he swore an oath at me, made a hit at\r\nme,--it was a round weak blow that missed me and almost knocked himself\r\ndown, for it made him stumble,--and then he ran into the mist, stumbling\r\ntwice as he went, and I lost him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s the young man!\xe2\x80\x9d I thought, feeling my heart shoot as I identified\r\nhim. I dare say I should have felt a pain in my liver, too, if I had\r\nknown where it was.\r\n\r\nI was soon at the Battery after that, and there was the right\r\nman,--hugging himself and limping to and fro, as if he had never all\r\nnight left off hugging and limping,--waiting for me. He was awfully\r\ncold, to be sure. I half expected to see him drop down before my face\r\nand die of deadly cold. His eyes looked so awfully hungry too, that when\r\nI handed him the file and he laid it down on the grass, it occurred to\r\nme he would have tried to eat it, if he had not seen my bundle. He did\r\nnot turn me upside down this time to get at what I had, but left me\r\nright side upwards while I opened the bundle and emptied my pockets.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s in the bottle, boy?\xe2\x80\x9d said he.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBrandy,\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\nHe was already handing mincemeat down his throat in the most curious\r\nmanner,--more like a man who was putting it away somewhere in a violent\r\nhurry, than a man who was eating it,--but he left off to take some of\r\nthe liquor. He shivered all the while so violently, that it was quite\r\nas much as he could do to keep the neck of the bottle between his teeth,\r\nwithout biting it off.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think you have got the ague,\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m much of your opinion, boy,\xe2\x80\x9d said he.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s bad about here,\xe2\x80\x9d I told him. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve been lying out on the meshes,\r\nand they\xe2\x80\x99re dreadful aguish. Rheumatic too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll eat my breakfast afore they\xe2\x80\x99re the death of me,\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d do\r\nthat, if I was going to be strung up to that there gallows as there is\r\nover there, directly afterwards. I\xe2\x80\x99ll beat the shivers so far, I\xe2\x80\x99ll bet\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was gobbling mincemeat, meatbone, bread, cheese, and pork pie, all\r\nat once: staring distrustfully while he did so at the mist all round\r\nus, and often stopping--even stopping his jaws--to listen. Some real or\r\nfancied sound, some clink upon the river or breathing of beast upon the\r\nmarsh, now gave him a start, and he said, suddenly,--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re not a deceiving imp? You brought no one with you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, sir! No!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNor giv\xe2\x80\x99 no one the office to follow you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cI believe you. You\xe2\x80\x99d be but a fierce young hound\r\nindeed, if at your time of life you could help to hunt a wretched\r\nwarmint hunted as near death and dunghill as this poor wretched warmint\r\nis!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSomething clicked in his throat as if he had works in him like a clock,\r\nand was going to strike. And he smeared his ragged rough sleeve over his\r\neyes.\r\n\r\nPitying his desolation, and watching him as he gradually settled down\r\nupon the pie, I made bold to say, \xe2\x80\x9cI am glad you enjoy it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you speak?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI said I was glad you enjoyed it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThankee, my boy. I do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI had often watched a large dog of ours eating his food; and I now\r\nnoticed a decided similarity between the dog\xe2\x80\x99s way of eating, and the\r\nman\xe2\x80\x99s. The man took strong sharp sudden bites, just like the dog. He\r\nswallowed, or rather snapped up, every mouthful, too soon and too fast;\r\nand he looked sideways here and there while he ate, as if he thought\r\nthere was danger in every direction of somebody\xe2\x80\x99s coming to take the pie\r\naway. He was altogether too unsettled in his mind over it, to appreciate\r\nit comfortably I thought, or to have anybody to dine with him, without\r\nmaking a chop with his jaws at the visitor. In all of which particulars\r\nhe was very like the dog.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am afraid you won\xe2\x80\x99t leave any of it for him,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, timidly; after\r\na silence during which I had hesitated as to the politeness of making\r\nthe remark. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s no more to be got where that came from.\xe2\x80\x9d It was the\r\ncertainty of this fact that impelled me to offer the hint.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLeave any for him? Who\xe2\x80\x99s him?\xe2\x80\x9d said my friend, stopping in his\r\ncrunching of pie-crust.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe young man. That you spoke of. That was hid with you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh ah!\xe2\x80\x9d he returned, with something like a gruff laugh. \xe2\x80\x9cHim? Yes, yes!\r\nHe don\xe2\x80\x99t want no wittles.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought he looked as if he did,\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\nThe man stopped eating, and regarded me with the keenest scrutiny and\r\nthe greatest surprise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLooked? When?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYonder,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, pointing; \xe2\x80\x9cover there, where I found him nodding\r\nasleep, and thought it was you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe held me by the collar and stared at me so, that I began to think his\r\nfirst idea about cutting my throat had revived.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDressed like you, you know, only with a hat,\xe2\x80\x9d I explained, trembling;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cand--and\xe2\x80\x9d--I was very anxious to put this delicately--\xe2\x80\x9cand with--the\r\nsame reason for wanting to borrow a file. Didn\xe2\x80\x99t you hear the cannon\r\nlast night?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen there was firing!\xe2\x80\x9d he said to himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wonder you shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have been sure of that,\xe2\x80\x9d I returned, \xe2\x80\x9cfor\r\nwe heard it up at home, and that\xe2\x80\x99s farther away, and we were shut in\r\nbesides.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, see now!\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen a man\xe2\x80\x99s alone on these flats, with a\r\nlight head and a light stomach, perishing of cold and want, he hears\r\nnothin\xe2\x80\x99 all night, but guns firing, and voices calling. Hears? He sees\r\nthe soldiers, with their red coats lighted up by the torches carried\r\nafore, closing in round him. Hears his number called, hears himself\r\nchallenged, hears the rattle of the muskets, hears the orders \xe2\x80\x98Make\r\nready! Present! Cover him steady, men!\xe2\x80\x99 and is laid hands on--and\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x99s nothin\xe2\x80\x99! Why, if I see one pursuing party last night--coming up\r\nin order, Damn \xe2\x80\x98em, with their tramp, tramp--I see a hundred. And as to\r\nfiring! Why, I see the mist shake with the cannon, arter it was broad\r\nday,--But this man\xe2\x80\x9d; he had said all the rest, as if he had forgotten my\r\nbeing there; \xe2\x80\x9cdid you notice anything in him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe had a badly bruised face,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, recalling what I hardly knew I\r\nknew.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot here?\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the man, striking his left cheek mercilessly, with\r\nthe flat of his hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, there!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere is he?\xe2\x80\x9d He crammed what little food was left, into the breast of\r\nhis gray jacket. \xe2\x80\x9cShow me the way he went. I\xe2\x80\x99ll pull him down, like a\r\nbloodhound. Curse this iron on my sore leg! Give us hold of the file,\r\nboy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI indicated in what direction the mist had shrouded the other man,\r\nand he looked up at it for an instant. But he was down on the rank wet\r\ngrass, filing at his iron like a madman, and not minding me or minding\r\nhis own leg, which had an old chafe upon it and was bloody, but which he\r\nhandled as roughly as if it had no more feeling in it than the file. I\r\nwas very much afraid of him again, now that he had worked himself into\r\nthis fierce hurry, and I was likewise very much afraid of keeping away\r\nfrom home any longer. I told him I must go, but he took no notice, so\r\nI thought the best thing I could do was to slip off. The last I saw\r\nof him, his head was bent over his knee and he was working hard at his\r\nfetter, muttering impatient imprecations at it and at his leg. The last\r\nI heard of him, I stopped in the mist to listen, and the file was still\r\ngoing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter IV\r\n\r\nI fully expected to find a Constable in the kitchen, waiting to take me\r\nup. But not only was there no Constable there, but no discovery had yet\r\nbeen made of the robbery. Mrs. Joe was prodigiously busy in getting the\r\nhouse ready for the festivities of the day, and Joe had been put upon\r\nthe kitchen doorstep to keep him out of the dust-pan,--an article into\r\nwhich his destiny always led him, sooner or later, when my sister was\r\nvigorously reaping the floors of her establishment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd where the deuce ha\xe2\x80\x99 you been?\xe2\x80\x9d was Mrs. Joe\xe2\x80\x99s Christmas salutation,\r\nwhen I and my conscience showed ourselves.\r\n\r\nI said I had been down to hear the Carols. \xe2\x80\x9cAh! well!\xe2\x80\x9d observed Mrs.\r\nJoe. \xe2\x80\x9cYou might ha\xe2\x80\x99 done worse.\xe2\x80\x9d Not a doubt of that I thought.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps if I warn\xe2\x80\x99t a blacksmith\xe2\x80\x99s wife, and (what\xe2\x80\x99s the same thing) a\r\nslave with her apron never off, I should have been to hear the Carols,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n said Mrs. Joe. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m rather partial to Carols, myself, and that\xe2\x80\x99s the\r\nbest of reasons for my never hearing any.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJoe, who had ventured into the kitchen after me as the dustpan had\r\nretired before us, drew the back of his hand across his nose with a\r\nconciliatory air, when Mrs. Joe darted a look at him, and, when her eyes\r\nwere withdrawn, secretly crossed his two forefingers, and exhibited them\r\nto me, as our token that Mrs. Joe was in a cross temper. This was so\r\nmuch her normal state, that Joe and I would often, for weeks together,\r\nbe, as to our fingers, like monumental Crusaders as to their legs.\r\n\r\nWe were to have a superb dinner, consisting of a leg of pickled pork and\r\ngreens, and a pair of roast stuffed fowls. A handsome mince-pie had\r\nbeen made yesterday morning (which accounted for the mincemeat not\r\nbeing missed), and the pudding was already on the boil. These extensive\r\narrangements occasioned us to be cut off unceremoniously in respect of\r\nbreakfast; \xe2\x80\x9cfor I ain\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Joe,--\xe2\x80\x9cI ain\xe2\x80\x99t a going to have\r\nno formal cramming and busting and washing up now, with what I\xe2\x80\x99ve got\r\nbefore me, I promise you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo, we had our slices served out, as if we were two thousand troops on a\r\nforced march instead of a man and boy at home; and we took gulps of milk\r\nand water, with apologetic countenances, from a jug on the dresser. In\r\nthe meantime, Mrs. Joe put clean white curtains up, and tacked a new\r\nflowered flounce across the wide chimney to replace the old one, and\r\nuncovered the little state parlor across the passage, which was never\r\nuncovered at any other time, but passed the rest of the year in a cool\r\nhaze of silver paper, which even extended to the four little white\r\ncrockery poodles on the mantel-shelf, each with a black nose and a\r\nbasket of flowers in his mouth, and each the counterpart of the other.\r\nMrs. Joe was a very clean housekeeper, but had an exquisite art of\r\nmaking her cleanliness more uncomfortable and unacceptable than dirt\r\nitself. Cleanliness is next to Godliness, and some people do the same by\r\ntheir religion.\r\n\r\nMy sister, having so much to do, was going to church vicariously, that\r\nis to say, Joe and I were going. In his working-clothes, Joe was a\r\nwell-knit characteristic-looking blacksmith; in his holiday clothes,\r\nhe was more like a scarecrow in good circumstances, than anything else.\r\nNothing that he wore then fitted him or seemed to belong to him; and\r\neverything that he wore then grazed him. On the present festive occasion\r\nhe emerged from his room, when the blithe bells were going, the picture\r\nof misery, in a full suit of Sunday penitentials. As to me, I think my\r\nsister must have had some general idea that I was a young offender whom\r\nan Accoucheur Policeman had taken up (on my birthday) and delivered over\r\nto her, to be dealt with according to the outraged majesty of the law.\r\nI was always treated as if I had insisted on being born in opposition\r\nto the dictates of reason, religion, and morality, and against the\r\ndissuading arguments of my best friends. Even when I was taken to have\r\na new suit of clothes, the tailor had orders to make them like a kind of\r\nReformatory, and on no account to let me have the free use of my limbs.\r\n\r\nJoe and I going to church, therefore, must have been a moving spectacle\r\nfor compassionate minds. Yet, what I suffered outside was nothing to\r\nwhat I underwent within. The terrors that had assailed me whenever\r\nMrs. Joe had gone near the pantry, or out of the room, were only to be\r\nequalled by the remorse with which my mind dwelt on what my hands had\r\ndone. Under the weight of my wicked secret, I pondered whether the\r\nChurch would be powerful enough to shield me from the vengeance of the\r\nterrible young man, if I divulged to that establishment. I conceived the\r\nidea that the time when the banns were read and when the clergyman said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYe are now to declare it!\xe2\x80\x9d would be the time for me to rise and propose\r\na private conference in the vestry. I am far from being sure that I\r\nmight not have astonished our small congregation by resorting to this\r\nextreme measure, but for its being Christmas Day and no Sunday.\r\n\r\nMr. Wopsle, the clerk at church, was to dine with us; and Mr. Hubble\r\nthe wheelwright and Mrs. Hubble; and Uncle Pumblechook (Joe\xe2\x80\x99s uncle,\r\nbut Mrs. Joe appropriated him), who was a well-to-do cornchandler in\r\nthe nearest town, and drove his own chaise-cart. The dinner hour was\r\nhalf-past one. When Joe and I got home, we found the table laid, and\r\nMrs. Joe dressed, and the dinner dressing, and the front door unlocked\r\n(it never was at any other time) for the company to enter by, and\r\neverything most splendid. And still, not a word of the robbery.\r\n\r\nThe time came, without bringing with it any relief to my feelings, and\r\nthe company came. Mr. Wopsle, united to a Roman nose and a large shining\r\nbald forehead, had a deep voice which he was uncommonly proud of; indeed\r\nit was understood among his acquaintance that if you could only give him\r\nhis head, he would read the clergyman into fits; he himself confessed\r\nthat if the Church was \xe2\x80\x9cthrown open,\xe2\x80\x9d meaning to competition, he would\r\nnot despair of making his mark in it. The Church not being \xe2\x80\x9cthrown\r\nopen,\xe2\x80\x9d he was, as I have said, our clerk. But he punished the Amens\r\ntremendously; and when he gave out the psalm,--always giving the whole\r\nverse,--he looked all round the congregation first, as much as to say,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have heard my friend overhead; oblige me with your opinion of this\r\nstyle!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI opened the door to the company,--making believe that it was a habit\r\nof ours to open that door,--and I opened it first to Mr. Wopsle, next\r\nto Mr. and Mrs. Hubble, and last of all to Uncle Pumblechook. N.B. I was\r\nnot allowed to call him uncle, under the severest penalties.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Joe,\xe2\x80\x9d said Uncle Pumblechook, a large hard-breathing middle-aged\r\nslow man, with a mouth like a fish, dull staring eyes, and sandy hair\r\nstanding upright on his head, so that he looked as if he had just been\r\nall but choked, and had that moment come to, \xe2\x80\x9cI have brought you as the\r\ncompliments of the season--I have brought you, Mum, a bottle of sherry\r\nwine--and I have brought you, Mum, a bottle of port wine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEvery Christmas Day he presented himself, as a profound novelty, with\r\nexactly the same words, and carrying the two bottles like dumb-bells.\r\nEvery Christmas Day, Mrs. Joe replied, as she now replied, \xe2\x80\x9cO, Un--cle\r\nPum-ble--chook! This is kind!\xe2\x80\x9d Every Christmas Day, he retorted, as\r\nhe now retorted, \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s no more than your merits. And now are you all\r\nbobbish, and how\xe2\x80\x99s Sixpennorth of halfpence?\xe2\x80\x9d meaning me.\r\n\r\nWe dined on these occasions in the kitchen, and adjourned, for the nuts\r\nand oranges and apples to the parlor; which was a change very like\r\nJoe\xe2\x80\x99s change from his working-clothes to his Sunday dress. My sister was\r\nuncommonly lively on the present occasion, and indeed was generally more\r\ngracious in the society of Mrs. Hubble than in other company. I remember\r\nMrs. Hubble as a little curly sharp-edged person in sky-blue, who held a\r\nconventionally juvenile position, because she had married Mr. Hubble,--I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t know at what remote period,--when she was much younger than he. I\r\nremember Mr Hubble as a tough, high-shouldered, stooping old man, of a\r\nsawdusty fragrance, with his legs extraordinarily wide apart: so that in\r\nmy short days I always saw some miles of open country between them when\r\nI met him coming up the lane.\r\n\r\nAmong this good company I should have felt myself, even if I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nrobbed the pantry, in a false position. Not because I was squeezed in\r\nat an acute angle of the tablecloth, with the table in my chest, and the\r\nPumblechookian elbow in my eye, nor because I was not allowed to speak\r\n(I didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to speak), nor because I was regaled with the scaly tips\r\nof the drumsticks of the fowls, and with those obscure corners of pork\r\nof which the pig, when living, had had the least reason to be vain. No;\r\nI should not have minded that, if they would only have left me alone.\r\nBut they wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t leave me alone. They seemed to think the opportunity\r\nlost, if they failed to point the conversation at me, every now and\r\nthen, and stick the point into me. I might have been an unfortunate\r\nlittle bull in a Spanish arena, I got so smartingly touched up by these\r\nmoral goads.\r\n\r\nIt began the moment we sat down to dinner. Mr. Wopsle said grace with\r\ntheatrical declamation,--as it now appears to me, something like a\r\nreligious cross of the Ghost in Hamlet with Richard the Third,--and\r\nended with the very proper aspiration that we might be truly grateful.\r\nUpon which my sister fixed me with her eye, and said, in a low\r\nreproachful voice, \xe2\x80\x9cDo you hear that? Be grateful.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEspecially,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Pumblechook, \xe2\x80\x9cbe grateful, boy, to them which\r\nbrought you up by hand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Hubble shook her head, and contemplating me with a mournful\r\npresentiment that I should come to no good, asked, \xe2\x80\x9cWhy is it that the\r\nyoung are never grateful?\xe2\x80\x9d This moral mystery seemed too much for\r\nthe company until Mr. Hubble tersely solved it by saying, \xe2\x80\x9cNaterally\r\nwicious.\xe2\x80\x9d Everybody then murmured \xe2\x80\x9cTrue!\xe2\x80\x9d and looked at me in a\r\nparticularly unpleasant and personal manner.\r\n\r\nJoe\xe2\x80\x99s station and influence were something feebler (if possible) when\r\nthere was company than when there was none. But he always aided and\r\ncomforted me when he could, in some way of his own, and he always did so\r\nat dinner-time by giving me gravy, if there were any. There being plenty\r\nof gravy to-day, Joe spooned into my plate, at this point, about half a\r\npint.\r\n\r\nA little later on in the dinner, Mr. Wopsle reviewed the sermon with\r\nsome severity, and intimated--in the usual hypothetical case of the\r\nChurch being \xe2\x80\x9cthrown open\xe2\x80\x9d--what kind of sermon he would have given\r\nthem. After favoring them with some heads of that discourse, he remarked\r\nthat he considered the subject of the day\xe2\x80\x99s homily, ill chosen; which\r\nwas the less excusable, he added, when there were so many subjects\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cgoing about.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrue again,\xe2\x80\x9d said Uncle Pumblechook. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve hit it, sir! Plenty of\r\nsubjects going about, for them that know how to put salt upon their\r\ntails. That\xe2\x80\x99s what\xe2\x80\x99s wanted. A man needn\xe2\x80\x99t go far to find a subject,\r\nif he\xe2\x80\x99s ready with his salt-box.\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Pumblechook added, after a short\r\ninterval of reflection, \xe2\x80\x9cLook at Pork alone. There\xe2\x80\x99s a subject! If you\r\nwant a subject, look at Pork!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrue, sir. Many a moral for the young,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Mr. Wopsle,--and I\r\nknew he was going to lug me in, before he said it; \xe2\x80\x9cmight be deduced\r\nfrom that text.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n(\xe2\x80\x9cYou listen to this,\xe2\x80\x9d said my sister to me, in a severe parenthesis.)\r\n\r\nJoe gave me some more gravy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSwine,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued Mr. Wopsle, in his deepest voice, and pointing his fork\r\nat my blushes, as if he were mentioning my Christian name,--\xe2\x80\x9cswine were\r\nthe companions of the prodigal. The gluttony of Swine is put before us,\r\nas an example to the young.\xe2\x80\x9d (I thought this pretty well in him who\r\nhad been praising up the pork for being so plump and juicy.) \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is\r\ndetestable in a pig is more detestable in a boy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOr girl,\xe2\x80\x9d suggested Mr. Hubble.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course, or girl, Mr. Hubble,\xe2\x80\x9d assented Mr. Wopsle, rather irritably,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cbut there is no girl present.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBesides,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Pumblechook, turning sharp on me, \xe2\x80\x9cthink what you\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\ngot to be grateful for. If you\xe2\x80\x99d been born a Squeaker--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe was, if ever a child was,\xe2\x80\x9d said my sister, most emphatically.\r\n\r\nJoe gave me some more gravy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, but I mean a four-footed Squeaker,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Pumblechook. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you\r\nhad been born such, would you have been here now? Not you--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUnless in that form,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Wopsle, nodding towards the dish.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I don\xe2\x80\x99t mean in that form, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Mr. Pumblechook, who had\r\nan objection to being interrupted; \xe2\x80\x9cI mean, enjoying himself with his\r\nelders and betters, and improving himself with their conversation, and\r\nrolling in the lap of luxury. Would he have been doing that? No, he\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t. And what would have been your destination?\xe2\x80\x9d turning on me\r\nagain. \xe2\x80\x9cYou would have been disposed of for so many shillings according\r\nto the market price of the article, and Dunstable the butcher would have\r\ncome up to you as you lay in your straw, and he would have whipped you\r\nunder his left arm, and with his right he would have tucked up his frock\r\nto get a penknife from out of his waistcoat-pocket, and he would have\r\nshed your blood and had your life. No bringing up by hand then. Not a\r\nbit of it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJoe offered me more gravy, which I was afraid to take.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe was a world of trouble to you, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Hubble,\r\ncommiserating my sister.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrouble?\xe2\x80\x9d echoed my sister; \xe2\x80\x9ctrouble?\xe2\x80\x9d and then entered on a fearful\r\ncatalogue of all the illnesses I had been guilty of, and all the acts\r\nof sleeplessness I had committed, and all the high places I had tumbled\r\nfrom, and all the low places I had tumbled into, and all the injuries I\r\nhad done myself, and all the times she had wished me in my grave, and I\r\nhad contumaciously refused to go there.\r\n\r\nI think the Romans must have aggravated one another very much, with\r\ntheir noses. Perhaps, they became the restless people they were, in\r\nconsequence. Anyhow, Mr. Wopsle\xe2\x80\x99s Roman nose so aggravated me, during\r\nthe recital of my misdemeanours, that I should have liked to pull it\r\nuntil he howled. But, all I had endured up to this time was nothing in\r\ncomparison with the awful feelings that took possession of me when the\r\npause was broken which ensued upon my sister\xe2\x80\x99s recital, and in which\r\npause everybody had looked at me (as I felt painfully conscious) with\r\nindignation and abhorrence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYet,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Pumblechook, leading the company gently back to the\r\ntheme from which they had strayed, \xe2\x80\x9cPork--regarded as biled--is rich,\r\ntoo; ain\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave a little brandy, uncle,\xe2\x80\x9d said my sister.\r\n\r\nO Heavens, it had come at last! He would find it was weak, he would say\r\nit was weak, and I was lost! I held tight to the leg of the table under\r\nthe cloth, with both hands, and awaited my fate.\r\n\r\nMy sister went for the stone bottle, came back with the stone bottle,\r\nand poured his brandy out: no one else taking any. The wretched man\r\ntrifled with his glass,--took it up, looked at it through the light,\r\nput it down,--prolonged my misery. All this time Mrs. Joe and Joe were\r\nbriskly clearing the table for the pie and pudding.\r\n\r\nI couldn\xe2\x80\x99t keep my eyes off him. Always holding tight by the leg of the\r\ntable with my hands and feet, I saw the miserable creature finger his\r\nglass playfully, take it up, smile, throw his head back, and drink\r\nthe brandy off. Instantly afterwards, the company were seized with\r\nunspeakable consternation, owing to his springing to his feet, turning\r\nround several times in an appalling spasmodic whooping-cough dance,\r\nand rushing out at the door; he then became visible through the window,\r\nviolently plunging and expectorating, making the most hideous faces, and\r\napparently out of his mind.\r\n\r\nI held on tight, while Mrs. Joe and Joe ran to him. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know how\r\nI had done it, but I had no doubt I had murdered him somehow. In my\r\ndreadful situation, it was a relief when he was brought back, and\r\nsurveying the company all round as if they had disagreed with him, sank\r\ndown into his chair with the one significant gasp, \xe2\x80\x9cTar!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI had filled up the bottle from the tar-water jug. I knew he would be\r\nworse by and by. I moved the table, like a Medium of the present day, by\r\nthe vigor of my unseen hold upon it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTar!\xe2\x80\x9d cried my sister, in amazement. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, how ever could Tar come\r\nthere?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut, Uncle Pumblechook, who was omnipotent in that kitchen, wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nhear the word, wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t hear of the subject, imperiously waved it all\r\naway with his hand, and asked for hot gin and water. My sister, who had\r\nbegun to be alarmingly meditative, had to employ herself actively in\r\ngetting the gin, the hot water, the sugar, and the lemon-peel, and mixing\r\nthem. For the time being at least, I was saved. I still held on to the\r\nleg of the table, but clutched it now with the fervor of gratitude.\r\n\r\nBy degrees, I became calm enough to release my grasp and partake of\r\npudding. Mr. Pumblechook partook of pudding. All partook of pudding.\r\nThe course terminated, and Mr. Pumblechook had begun to beam under the\r\ngenial influence of gin and water. I began to think I should get over\r\nthe day, when my sister said to Joe, \xe2\x80\x9cClean plates,--cold.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI clutched the leg of the table again immediately, and pressed it to my\r\nbosom as if it had been the companion of my youth and friend of my soul.\r\nI foresaw what was coming, and I felt that this time I really was gone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must taste,\xe2\x80\x9d said my sister, addressing the guests with her best\r\ngrace--\xe2\x80\x9cyou must taste, to finish with, such a delightful and delicious\r\npresent of Uncle Pumblechook\xe2\x80\x99s!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMust they! Let them not hope to taste it!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must know,\xe2\x80\x9d said my sister, rising, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s a pie; a savory pork\r\npie.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe company murmured their compliments. Uncle Pumblechook, sensible of\r\nhaving deserved well of his fellow-creatures, said,--quite vivaciously,\r\nall things considered,--\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Mrs. Joe, we\xe2\x80\x99ll do our best endeavors;\r\nlet us have a cut at this same pie.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMy sister went out to get it. I heard her steps proceed to the pantry. I\r\nsaw Mr. Pumblechook balance his knife. I saw reawakening appetite in the\r\nRoman nostrils of Mr. Wopsle. I heard Mr. Hubble remark that \xe2\x80\x9ca bit of\r\nsavory pork pie would lay atop of anything you could mention, and do\r\nno harm,\xe2\x80\x9d and I heard Joe say, \xe2\x80\x9cYou shall have some, Pip.\xe2\x80\x9d I have never\r\nbeen absolutely certain whether I uttered a shrill yell of terror,\r\nmerely in spirit, or in the bodily hearing of the company. I felt that I\r\ncould bear no more, and that I must run away. I released the leg of the\r\ntable, and ran for my life.\r\n\r\nBut I ran no farther than the house door, for there I ran head-foremost\r\ninto a party of soldiers with their muskets, one of whom held out a pair\r\nof handcuffs to me, saying, \xe2\x80\x9cHere you are, look sharp, come on!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter V\r\n\r\nThe apparition of a file of soldiers ringing down the but-ends of their\r\nloaded muskets on our door-step, caused the dinner-party to rise\r\nfrom table in confusion, and caused Mrs. Joe re-entering the kitchen\r\nempty-handed, to stop short and stare, in her wondering lament of\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGracious goodness gracious me, what\xe2\x80\x99s gone--with the--pie!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe sergeant and I were in the kitchen when Mrs. Joe stood staring;\r\nat which crisis I partially recovered the use of my senses. It was\r\nthe sergeant who had spoken to me, and he was now looking round at the\r\ncompany, with his handcuffs invitingly extended towards them in his\r\nright hand, and his left on my shoulder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExcuse me, ladies and gentleman,\xe2\x80\x9d said the sergeant, \xe2\x80\x9cbut as I have\r\nmentioned at the door to this smart young shaver,\xe2\x80\x9d (which he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t), \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nam on a chase in the name of the king, and I want the blacksmith.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd pray what might you want with him?\xe2\x80\x9d retorted my sister, quick to\r\nresent his being wanted at all.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMissis,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the gallant sergeant, \xe2\x80\x9cspeaking for myself, I should\r\nreply, the honor and pleasure of his fine wife\xe2\x80\x99s acquaintance; speaking\r\nfor the king, I answer, a little job done.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis was received as rather neat in the sergeant; insomuch that Mr.\r\nPumblechook cried audibly, \xe2\x80\x9cGood again!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou see, blacksmith,\xe2\x80\x9d said the sergeant, who had by this time picked\r\nout Joe with his eye, \xe2\x80\x9cwe have had an accident with these, and I find\r\nthe lock of one of \xe2\x80\x98em goes wrong, and the coupling don\xe2\x80\x99t act pretty.\r\nAs they are wanted for immediate service, will you throw your eye over\r\nthem?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJoe threw his eye over them, and pronounced that the job would\r\nnecessitate the lighting of his forge fire, and would take nearer\r\ntwo hours than one. \xe2\x80\x9cWill it? Then will you set about it at once,\r\nblacksmith?\xe2\x80\x9d said the off-hand sergeant, \xe2\x80\x9cas it\xe2\x80\x99s on his Majesty\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nservice. And if my men can bear a hand anywhere, they\xe2\x80\x99ll make themselves\r\nuseful.\xe2\x80\x9d With that, he called to his men, who came trooping into the\r\nkitchen one after another, and piled their arms in a corner. And then\r\nthey stood about, as soldiers do; now, with their hands loosely clasped\r\nbefore them; now, resting a knee or a shoulder; now, easing a belt or a\r\npouch; now, opening the door to spit stiffly over their high stocks, out\r\ninto the yard.\r\n\r\nAll these things I saw without then knowing that I saw them, for I\r\nwas in an agony of apprehension. But beginning to perceive that the\r\nhandcuffs were not for me, and that the military had so far got the\r\nbetter of the pie as to put it in the background, I collected a little\r\nmore of my scattered wits.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWould you give me the time?\xe2\x80\x9d said the sergeant, addressing himself to\r\nMr. Pumblechook, as to a man whose appreciative powers justified the\r\ninference that he was equal to the time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s just gone half past two.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s not so bad,\xe2\x80\x9d said the sergeant, reflecting; \xe2\x80\x9ceven if I was\r\nforced to halt here nigh two hours, that\xe2\x80\x99ll do. How far might you call\r\nyourselves from the marshes, hereabouts? Not above a mile, I reckon?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust a mile,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Joe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99ll do. We begin to close in upon \xe2\x80\x98em about dusk. A little before\r\ndusk, my orders are. That\xe2\x80\x99ll do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cConvicts, sergeant?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mr. Wopsle, in a matter-of-course way.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy!\xe2\x80\x9d returned the sergeant, \xe2\x80\x9ctwo. They\xe2\x80\x99re pretty well known to be out\r\non the marshes still, and they won\xe2\x80\x99t try to get clear of \xe2\x80\x98em before\r\ndusk. Anybody here seen anything of any such game?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEverybody, myself excepted, said no, with confidence. Nobody thought of\r\nme.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell!\xe2\x80\x9d said the sergeant, \xe2\x80\x9cthey\xe2\x80\x99ll find themselves trapped in a circle,\r\nI expect, sooner than they count on. Now, blacksmith! If you\xe2\x80\x99re ready,\r\nhis Majesty the King is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJoe had got his coat and waistcoat and cravat off, and his leather apron\r\non, and passed into the forge. One of the soldiers opened its wooden\r\nwindows, another lighted the fire, another turned to at the bellows, the\r\nrest stood round the blaze, which was soon roaring. Then Joe began to\r\nhammer and clink, hammer and clink, and we all looked on.\r\n\r\nThe interest of the impending pursuit not only absorbed the general\r\nattention, but even made my sister liberal. She drew a pitcher of beer\r\nfrom the cask for the soldiers, and invited the sergeant to take a glass\r\nof brandy. But Mr. Pumblechook said, sharply, \xe2\x80\x9cGive him wine, Mum. I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nengage there\xe2\x80\x99s no tar in that:\xe2\x80\x9d so, the sergeant thanked him and said\r\nthat as he preferred his drink without tar, he would take wine, if it\r\nwas equally convenient. When it was given him, he drank his Majesty\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhealth and compliments of the season, and took it all at a mouthful and\r\nsmacked his lips.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood stuff, eh, sergeant?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Pumblechook.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you something,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the sergeant; \xe2\x80\x9cI suspect that\r\nstuff\xe2\x80\x99s of your providing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Pumblechook, with a fat sort of laugh, said, \xe2\x80\x9cAy, ay? Why?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the sergeant, clapping him on the shoulder, \xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99re\r\na man that knows what\xe2\x80\x99s what.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cD\xe2\x80\x99ye think so?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Pumblechook, with his former laugh. \xe2\x80\x9cHave\r\nanother glass!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith you. Hob and nob,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the sergeant. \xe2\x80\x9cThe top of mine to the\r\nfoot of yours,--the foot of yours to the top of mine,--Ring once, ring\r\ntwice,--the best tune on the Musical Glasses! Your health. May you live\r\na thousand years, and never be a worse judge of the right sort than you\r\nare at the present moment of your life!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe sergeant tossed off his glass again and seemed quite ready for\r\nanother glass. I noticed that Mr. Pumblechook in his hospitality\r\nappeared to forget that he had made a present of the wine, but took the\r\nbottle from Mrs. Joe and had all the credit of handing it about in a\r\ngush of joviality. Even I got some. And he was so very free of the wine\r\nthat he even called for the other bottle, and handed that about with the\r\nsame liberality, when the first was gone.\r\n\r\nAs I watched them while they all stood clustering about the forge,\r\nenjoying themselves so much, I thought what terrible good sauce for\r\na dinner my fugitive friend on the marshes was. They had not enjoyed\r\nthemselves a quarter so much, before the entertainment was brightened\r\nwith the excitement he furnished. And now, when they were all in lively\r\nanticipation of \xe2\x80\x9cthe two villains\xe2\x80\x9d being taken, and when the bellows\r\nseemed to roar for the fugitives, the fire to flare for them, the smoke\r\nto hurry away in pursuit of them, Joe to hammer and clink for them,\r\nand all the murky shadows on the wall to shake at them in menace as the\r\nblaze rose and sank, and the red-hot sparks dropped and died, the pale\r\nafternoon outside almost seemed in my pitying young fancy to have turned\r\npale on their account, poor wretches.\r\n\r\nAt last, Joe\xe2\x80\x99s job was done, and the ringing and roaring stopped. As Joe\r\ngot on his coat, he mustered courage to propose that some of us should\r\ngo down with the soldiers and see what came of the hunt. Mr. Pumblechook\r\nand Mr. Hubble declined, on the plea of a pipe and ladies\xe2\x80\x99 society; but\r\nMr. Wopsle said he would go, if Joe would. Joe said he was agreeable,\r\nand would take me, if Mrs. Joe approved. We never should have got leave\r\nto go, I am sure, but for Mrs. Joe\xe2\x80\x99s curiosity to know all about it and\r\nhow it ended. As it was, she merely stipulated, \xe2\x80\x9cIf you bring the boy\r\nback with his head blown to bits by a musket, don\xe2\x80\x99t look to me to put it\r\ntogether again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe sergeant took a polite leave of the ladies, and parted from Mr.\r\nPumblechook as from a comrade; though I doubt if he were quite as fully\r\nsensible of that gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s merits under arid conditions, as when\r\nsomething moist was going. His men resumed their muskets and fell in.\r\nMr. Wopsle, Joe, and I, received strict charge to keep in the rear, and\r\nto speak no word after we reached the marshes. When we were all out in\r\nthe raw air and were steadily moving towards our business, I treasonably\r\nwhispered to Joe, \xe2\x80\x9cI hope, Joe, we shan\xe2\x80\x99t find them.\xe2\x80\x9d and Joe whispered\r\nto me, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d give a shilling if they had cut and run, Pip.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe were joined by no stragglers from the village, for the weather was\r\ncold and threatening, the way dreary, the footing bad, darkness coming\r\non, and the people had good fires in-doors and were keeping the day. A\r\nfew faces hurried to glowing windows and looked after us, but none came\r\nout. We passed the finger-post, and held straight on to the churchyard.\r\nThere we were stopped a few minutes by a signal from the sergeant\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhand, while two or three of his men dispersed themselves among the\r\ngraves, and also examined the porch. They came in again without finding\r\nanything, and then we struck out on the open marshes, through the gate\r\nat the side of the churchyard. A bitter sleet came rattling against us\r\nhere on the east wind, and Joe took me on his back.\r\n\r\nNow that we were out upon the dismal wilderness where they little\r\nthought I had been within eight or nine hours and had seen both men\r\nhiding, I considered for the first time, with great dread, if we should\r\ncome upon them, would my particular convict suppose that it was I who\r\nhad brought the soldiers there? He had asked me if I was a deceiving\r\nimp, and he had said I should be a fierce young hound if I joined the\r\nhunt against him. Would he believe that I was both imp and hound in\r\ntreacherous earnest, and had betrayed him?\r\n\r\nIt was of no use asking myself this question now. There I was, on Joe\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nback, and there was Joe beneath me, charging at the ditches like a\r\nhunter, and stimulating Mr. Wopsle not to tumble on his Roman nose, and\r\nto keep up with us. The soldiers were in front of us, extending into a\r\npretty wide line with an interval between man and man. We were taking\r\nthe course I had begun with, and from which I had diverged in the mist.\r\nEither the mist was not out again yet, or the wind had dispelled it.\r\nUnder the low red glare of sunset, the beacon, and the gibbet, and the\r\nmound of the Battery, and the opposite shore of the river, were plain,\r\nthough all of a watery lead color.\r\n\r\nWith my heart thumping like a blacksmith at Joe\xe2\x80\x99s broad shoulder, I\r\nlooked all about for any sign of the convicts. I could see none, I could\r\nhear none. Mr. Wopsle had greatly alarmed me more than once, by his\r\nblowing and hard breathing; but I knew the sounds by this time, and\r\ncould dissociate them from the object of pursuit. I got a dreadful\r\nstart, when I thought I heard the file still going; but it was only a\r\nsheep-bell. The sheep stopped in their eating and looked timidly at\r\nus; and the cattle, their heads turned from the wind and sleet, stared\r\nangrily as if they held us responsible for both annoyances; but, except\r\nthese things, and the shudder of the dying day in every blade of grass,\r\nthere was no break in the bleak stillness of the marshes.\r\n\r\nThe soldiers were moving on in the direction of the old Battery, and we\r\nwere moving on a little way behind them, when, all of a sudden, we all\r\nstopped. For there had reached us on the wings of the wind and rain, a\r\nlong shout. It was repeated. It was at a distance towards the east, but\r\nit was long and loud. Nay, there seemed to be two or more shouts raised\r\ntogether,--if one might judge from a confusion in the sound.\r\n\r\nTo this effect the sergeant and the nearest men were speaking under\r\ntheir breath, when Joe and I came up. After another moment\xe2\x80\x99s listening,\r\nJoe (who was a good judge) agreed, and Mr. Wopsle (who was a bad judge)\r\nagreed. The sergeant, a decisive man, ordered that the sound should not\r\nbe answered, but that the course should be changed, and that his men\r\nshould make towards it \xe2\x80\x9cat the double.\xe2\x80\x9d So we slanted to the right\r\n(where the East was), and Joe pounded away so wonderfully, that I had to\r\nhold on tight to keep my seat.\r\n\r\nIt was a run indeed now, and what Joe called, in the only two words he\r\nspoke all the time, \xe2\x80\x9ca Winder.\xe2\x80\x9d Down banks and up banks, and over gates,\r\nand splashing into dikes, and breaking among coarse rushes: no man cared\r\nwhere he went. As we came nearer to the shouting, it became more and\r\nmore apparent that it was made by more than one voice. Sometimes, it\r\nseemed to stop altogether, and then the soldiers stopped. When it broke\r\nout again, the soldiers made for it at a greater rate than ever, and we\r\nafter them. After a while, we had so run it down, that we could hear one\r\nvoice calling \xe2\x80\x9cMurder!\xe2\x80\x9d and another voice, \xe2\x80\x9cConvicts! Runaways! Guard!\r\nThis way for the runaway convicts!\xe2\x80\x9d Then both voices would seem to be\r\nstifled in a struggle, and then would break out again. And when it had\r\ncome to this, the soldiers ran like deer, and Joe too.\r\n\r\nThe sergeant ran in first, when we had run the noise quite down, and two\r\nof his men ran in close upon him. Their pieces were cocked and levelled\r\nwhen we all ran in.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere are both men!\xe2\x80\x9d panted the sergeant, struggling at the bottom of a\r\nditch. \xe2\x80\x9cSurrender, you two! and confound you for two wild beasts! Come\r\nasunder!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWater was splashing, and mud was flying, and oaths were being sworn, and\r\nblows were being struck, when some more men went down into the ditch to\r\nhelp the sergeant, and dragged out, separately, my convict and the other\r\none. Both were bleeding and panting and execrating and struggling; but\r\nof course I knew them both directly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMind!\xe2\x80\x9d said my convict, wiping blood from his face with his ragged\r\nsleeves, and shaking torn hair from his fingers: \xe2\x80\x9cI took him! I give him\r\nup to you! Mind that!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not much to be particular about,\xe2\x80\x9d said the sergeant; \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99ll do you\r\nsmall good, my man, being in the same plight yourself. Handcuffs there!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t expect it to do me any good. I don\xe2\x80\x99t want it to do me more good\r\nthan it does now,\xe2\x80\x9d said my convict, with a greedy laugh. \xe2\x80\x9cI took him. He\r\nknows it. That\xe2\x80\x99s enough for me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe other convict was livid to look at, and, in addition to the old\r\nbruised left side of his face, seemed to be bruised and torn all over.\r\nHe could not so much as get his breath to speak, until they were both\r\nseparately handcuffed, but leaned upon a soldier to keep himself from\r\nfalling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake notice, guard,--he tried to murder me,\xe2\x80\x9d were his first words.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTried to murder him?\xe2\x80\x9d said my convict, disdainfully. \xe2\x80\x9cTry, and not\r\ndo it? I took him, and giv\xe2\x80\x99 him up; that\xe2\x80\x99s what I done. I not only\r\nprevented him getting off the marshes, but I dragged him here,--dragged\r\nhim this far on his way back. He\xe2\x80\x99s a gentleman, if you please, this\r\nvillain. Now, the Hulks has got its gentleman again, through me. Murder\r\nhim? Worth my while, too, to murder him, when I could do worse and drag\r\nhim back!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe other one still gasped, \xe2\x80\x9cHe tried--he tried-to--murder me.\r\nBear--bear witness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLookee here!\xe2\x80\x9d said my convict to the sergeant. \xe2\x80\x9cSingle-handed I got\r\nclear of the prison-ship; I made a dash and I done it. I could ha\xe2\x80\x99 got\r\nclear of these death-cold flats likewise--look at my leg: you won\xe2\x80\x99t find\r\nmuch iron on it--if I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t made the discovery that he was here. Let\r\nhim go free? Let him profit by the means as I found out? Let him make a\r\ntool of me afresh and again? Once more? No, no, no. If I had died at\r\nthe bottom there,\xe2\x80\x9d and he made an emphatic swing at the ditch with his\r\nmanacled hands, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d have held to him with that grip, that you should\r\nhave been safe to find him in my hold.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe other fugitive, who was evidently in extreme horror of his\r\ncompanion, repeated, \xe2\x80\x9cHe tried to murder me. I should have been a dead\r\nman if you had not come up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe lies!\xe2\x80\x9d said my convict, with fierce energy. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s a liar born, and\r\nhe\xe2\x80\x99ll die a liar. Look at his face; ain\xe2\x80\x99t it written there? Let him turn\r\nthose eyes of his on me. I defy him to do it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe other, with an effort at a scornful smile, which could not, however,\r\ncollect the nervous working of his mouth into any set expression, looked\r\nat the soldiers, and looked about at the marshes and at the sky, but\r\ncertainly did not look at the speaker.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you see him?\xe2\x80\x9d pursued my convict. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you see what a villain he is?\r\nDo you see those grovelling and wandering eyes? That\xe2\x80\x99s how he looked\r\nwhen we were tried together. He never looked at me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe other, always working and working his dry lips and turning his eyes\r\nrestlessly about him far and near, did at last turn them for a moment on\r\nthe speaker, with the words, \xe2\x80\x9cYou are not much to look at,\xe2\x80\x9d and with\r\na half-taunting glance at the bound hands. At that point, my convict\r\nbecame so frantically exasperated, that he would have rushed upon him\r\nbut for the interposition of the soldiers. \xe2\x80\x9cDidn\xe2\x80\x99t I tell you,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nother convict then, \xe2\x80\x9cthat he would murder me, if he could?\xe2\x80\x9d And any one\r\ncould see that he shook with fear, and that there broke out upon his\r\nlips curious white flakes, like thin snow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEnough of this parley,\xe2\x80\x9d said the sergeant. \xe2\x80\x9cLight those torches.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs one of the soldiers, who carried a basket in lieu of a gun, went down\r\non his knee to open it, my convict looked round him for the first time,\r\nand saw me. I had alighted from Joe\xe2\x80\x99s back on the brink of the ditch\r\nwhen we came up, and had not moved since. I looked at him eagerly when\r\nhe looked at me, and slightly moved my hands and shook my head. I had\r\nbeen waiting for him to see me that I might try to assure him of my\r\ninnocence. It was not at all expressed to me that he even comprehended\r\nmy intention, for he gave me a look that I did not understand, and it\r\nall passed in a moment. But if he had looked at me for an hour or for\r\na day, I could not have remembered his face ever afterwards, as having\r\nbeen more attentive.\r\n\r\nThe soldier with the basket soon got a light, and lighted three or four\r\ntorches, and took one himself and distributed the others. It had been\r\nalmost dark before, but now it seemed quite dark, and soon afterwards\r\nvery dark. Before we departed from that spot, four soldiers standing in\r\na ring, fired twice into the air. Presently we saw other torches kindled\r\nat some distance behind us, and others on the marshes on the opposite\r\nbank of the river. \xe2\x80\x9cAll right,\xe2\x80\x9d said the sergeant. \xe2\x80\x9cMarch.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe had not gone far when three cannon were fired ahead of us with a\r\nsound that seemed to burst something inside my ear. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are expected\r\non board,\xe2\x80\x9d said the sergeant to my convict; \xe2\x80\x9cthey know you are coming.\r\nDon\xe2\x80\x99t straggle, my man. Close up here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe two were kept apart, and each walked surrounded by a separate guard.\r\nI had hold of Joe\xe2\x80\x99s hand now, and Joe carried one of the torches. Mr.\r\nWopsle had been for going back, but Joe was resolved to see it out, so\r\nwe went on with the party. There was a reasonably good path now, mostly\r\non the edge of the river, with a divergence here and there where a dike\r\ncame, with a miniature windmill on it and a muddy sluice-gate. When\r\nI looked round, I could see the other lights coming in after us. The\r\ntorches we carried dropped great blotches of fire upon the track, and\r\nI could see those, too, lying smoking and flaring. I could see nothing\r\nelse but black darkness. Our lights warmed the air about us with their\r\npitchy blaze, and the two prisoners seemed rather to like that, as they\r\nlimped along in the midst of the muskets. We could not go fast, because\r\nof their lameness; and they were so spent, that two or three times we\r\nhad to halt while they rested.\r\n\r\nAfter an hour or so of this travelling, we came to a rough wooden hut\r\nand a landing-place. There was a guard in the hut, and they challenged,\r\nand the sergeant answered. Then, we went into the hut, where there was\r\na smell of tobacco and whitewash, and a bright fire, and a lamp, and\r\na stand of muskets, and a drum, and a low wooden bedstead, like an\r\novergrown mangle without the machinery, capable of holding about a dozen\r\nsoldiers all at once. Three or four soldiers who lay upon it in their\r\ngreat-coats were not much interested in us, but just lifted their heads\r\nand took a sleepy stare, and then lay down again. The sergeant made some\r\nkind of report, and some entry in a book, and then the convict whom I\r\ncall the other convict was drafted off with his guard, to go on board\r\nfirst.\r\n\r\nMy convict never looked at me, except that once. While we stood in the\r\nhut, he stood before the fire looking thoughtfully at it, or putting up\r\nhis feet by turns upon the hob, and looking thoughtfully at them as if\r\nhe pitied them for their recent adventures. Suddenly, he turned to the\r\nsergeant, and remarked,--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish to say something respecting this escape. It may prevent some\r\npersons laying under suspicion alonger me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can say what you like,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the sergeant, standing coolly\r\nlooking at him with his arms folded, \xe2\x80\x9cbut you have no call to say it\r\nhere. You\xe2\x80\x99ll have opportunity enough to say about it, and hear about it,\r\nbefore it\xe2\x80\x99s done with, you know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know, but this is another pint, a separate matter. A man can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nstarve; at least I can\xe2\x80\x99t. I took some wittles, up at the willage over\r\nyonder,--where the church stands a\xe2\x80\x99most out on the marshes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou mean stole,\xe2\x80\x9d said the sergeant.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you where from. From the blacksmith\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHalloa!\xe2\x80\x9d said the sergeant, staring at Joe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHalloa, Pip!\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe, staring at me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was some broken wittles--that\xe2\x80\x99s what it was--and a dram of liquor,\r\nand a pie.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you happened to miss such an article as a pie, blacksmith?\xe2\x80\x9d asked\r\nthe sergeant, confidentially.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy wife did, at the very moment when you came in. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you know, Pip?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo,\xe2\x80\x9d said my convict, turning his eyes on Joe in a moody manner, and\r\nwithout the least glance at me,--\xe2\x80\x9cso you\xe2\x80\x99re the blacksmith, are you?\r\nThan I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry to say, I\xe2\x80\x99ve eat your pie.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod knows you\xe2\x80\x99re welcome to it,--so far as it was ever mine,\xe2\x80\x9d returned\r\nJoe, with a saving remembrance of Mrs. Joe. \xe2\x80\x9cWe don\xe2\x80\x99t know what you have\r\ndone, but we wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have you starved to death for it, poor miserable\r\nfellow-creatur.--Would us, Pip?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe something that I had noticed before, clicked in the man\xe2\x80\x99s throat\r\nagain, and he turned his back. The boat had returned, and his guard were\r\nready, so we followed him to the landing-place made of rough stakes\r\nand stones, and saw him put into the boat, which was rowed by a crew of\r\nconvicts like himself. No one seemed surprised to see him, or interested\r\nin seeing him, or glad to see him, or sorry to see him, or spoke a word,\r\nexcept that somebody in the boat growled as if to dogs, \xe2\x80\x9cGive way,\r\nyou!\xe2\x80\x9d which was the signal for the dip of the oars. By the light of the\r\ntorches, we saw the black Hulk lying out a little way from the mud of\r\nthe shore, like a wicked Noah\xe2\x80\x99s ark. Cribbed and barred and moored by\r\nmassive rusty chains, the prison-ship seemed in my young eyes to be\r\nironed like the prisoners. We saw the boat go alongside, and we saw\r\nhim taken up the side and disappear. Then, the ends of the torches were\r\nflung hissing into the water, and went out, as if it were all over with\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter VI\r\n\r\nMy state of mind regarding the pilfering from which I had been so\r\nunexpectedly exonerated did not impel me to frank disclosure; but I hope\r\nit had some dregs of good at the bottom of it.\r\n\r\nI do not recall that I felt any tenderness of conscience in reference\r\nto Mrs. Joe, when the fear of being found out was lifted off me. But\r\nI loved Joe,--perhaps for no better reason in those early days than\r\nbecause the dear fellow let me love him,--and, as to him, my inner self\r\nwas not so easily composed. It was much upon my mind (particularly when\r\nI first saw him looking about for his file) that I ought to tell Joe the\r\nwhole truth. Yet I did not, and for the reason that I mistrusted that\r\nif I did, he would think me worse than I was. The fear of losing Joe\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nconfidence, and of thenceforth sitting in the chimney corner at night\r\nstaring drearily at my forever lost companion and friend, tied up my\r\ntongue. I morbidly represented to myself that if Joe knew it, I never\r\nafterwards could see him at the fireside feeling his fair whisker,\r\nwithout thinking that he was meditating on it. That, if Joe knew it, I\r\nnever afterwards could see him glance, however casually, at yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmeat or pudding when it came on to-day\xe2\x80\x99s table, without thinking that he\r\nwas debating whether I had been in the pantry. That, if Joe knew it, and\r\nat any subsequent period of our joint domestic life remarked that his\r\nbeer was flat or thick, the conviction that he suspected tar in it,\r\nwould bring a rush of blood to my face. In a word, I was too cowardly\r\nto do what I knew to be right, as I had been too cowardly to avoid doing\r\nwhat I knew to be wrong. I had had no intercourse with the world at\r\nthat time, and I imitated none of its many inhabitants who act in this\r\nmanner. Quite an untaught genius, I made the discovery of the line of\r\naction for myself.\r\n\r\nAs I was sleepy before we were far away from the prison-ship, Joe took\r\nme on his back again and carried me home. He must have had a tiresome\r\njourney of it, for Mr. Wopsle, being knocked up, was in such a very bad\r\ntemper that if the Church had been thrown open, he would probably have\r\nexcommunicated the whole expedition, beginning with Joe and myself. In\r\nhis lay capacity, he persisted in sitting down in the damp to such\r\nan insane extent, that when his coat was taken off to be dried at the\r\nkitchen fire, the circumstantial evidence on his trousers would have\r\nhanged him, if it had been a capital offence.\r\n\r\nBy that time, I was staggering on the kitchen floor like a little\r\ndrunkard, through having been newly set upon my feet, and through having\r\nbeen fast asleep, and through waking in the heat and lights and noise of\r\ntongues. As I came to myself (with the aid of a heavy thump between the\r\nshoulders, and the restorative exclamation \xe2\x80\x9cYah! Was there ever such\r\na boy as this!\xe2\x80\x9d from my sister,) I found Joe telling them about the\r\nconvict\xe2\x80\x99s confession, and all the visitors suggesting different ways\r\nby which he had got into the pantry. Mr. Pumblechook made out, after\r\ncarefully surveying the premises, that he had first got upon the roof of\r\nthe forge, and had then got upon the roof of the house, and had then let\r\nhimself down the kitchen chimney by a rope made of his bedding cut\r\ninto strips; and as Mr. Pumblechook was very positive and drove his\r\nown chaise-cart--over everybody--it was agreed that it must be so. Mr.\r\nWopsle, indeed, wildly cried out, \xe2\x80\x9cNo!\xe2\x80\x9d with the feeble malice of a\r\ntired man; but, as he had no theory, and no coat on, he was unanimously\r\nset at naught,--not to mention his smoking hard behind, as he stood\r\nwith his back to the kitchen fire to draw the damp out: which was not\r\ncalculated to inspire confidence.\r\n\r\nThis was all I heard that night before my sister clutched me, as a\r\nslumberous offence to the company\xe2\x80\x99s eyesight, and assisted me up to bed\r\nwith such a strong hand that I seemed to have fifty boots on, and to be\r\ndangling them all against the edges of the stairs. My state of mind, as\r\nI have described it, began before I was up in the morning, and lasted\r\nlong after the subject had died out, and had ceased to be mentioned\r\nsaving on exceptional occasions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter VII\r\n\r\nAt the time when I stood in the churchyard reading the family\r\ntombstones, I had just enough learning to be able to spell them out. My\r\nconstruction even of their simple meaning was not very correct, for I\r\nread \xe2\x80\x9cwife of the Above\xe2\x80\x9d as a complimentary reference to my father\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nexaltation to a better world; and if any one of my deceased relations\r\nhad been referred to as \xe2\x80\x9cBelow,\xe2\x80\x9d I have no doubt I should have formed\r\nthe worst opinions of that member of the family. Neither were my notions\r\nof the theological positions to which my Catechism bound me, at\r\nall accurate; for, I have a lively remembrance that I supposed my\r\ndeclaration that I was to \xe2\x80\x9cwalk in the same all the days of my life,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n laid me under an obligation always to go through the village from our\r\nhouse in one particular direction, and never to vary it by turning down\r\nby the wheelwright\xe2\x80\x99s or up by the mill.\r\n\r\nWhen I was old enough, I was to be apprenticed to Joe, and until I could\r\nassume that dignity I was not to be what Mrs. Joe called \xe2\x80\x9cPompeyed,\xe2\x80\x9d or\r\n(as I render it) pampered. Therefore, I was not only odd-boy about the\r\nforge, but if any neighbor happened to want an extra boy to frighten\r\nbirds, or pick up stones, or do any such job, I was favored with the\r\nemployment. In order, however, that our superior position might not be\r\ncompromised thereby, a money-box was kept on the kitchen mantel-shelf,\r\ninto which it was publicly made known that all my earnings were\r\ndropped. I have an impression that they were to be contributed\r\neventually towards the liquidation of the National Debt, but I know I\r\nhad no hope of any personal participation in the treasure.\r\n\r\nMr. Wopsle\xe2\x80\x99s great-aunt kept an evening school in the village; that is\r\nto say, she was a ridiculous old woman of limited means and unlimited\r\ninfirmity, who used to go to sleep from six to seven every evening, in\r\nthe society of youth who paid two pence per week each, for the improving\r\nopportunity of seeing her do it. She rented a small cottage, and Mr.\r\nWopsle had the room upstairs, where we students used to overhear him\r\nreading aloud in a most dignified and terrific manner, and occasionally\r\nbumping on the ceiling. There was a fiction that Mr. Wopsle \xe2\x80\x9cexamined\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n the scholars once a quarter. What he did on those occasions was to turn\r\nup his cuffs, stick up his hair, and give us Mark Antony\xe2\x80\x99s oration over\r\nthe body of Caesar. This was always followed by Collins\xe2\x80\x99s Ode on\r\nthe Passions, wherein I particularly venerated Mr. Wopsle as Revenge\r\nthrowing his blood-stained sword in thunder down, and taking the\r\nWar-denouncing trumpet with a withering look. It was not with me then,\r\nas it was in later life, when I fell into the society of the Passions,\r\nand compared them with Collins and Wopsle, rather to the disadvantage of\r\nboth gentlemen.\r\n\r\nMr. Wopsle\xe2\x80\x99s great-aunt, besides keeping this Educational Institution,\r\nkept in the same room--a little general shop. She had no idea what stock\r\nshe had, or what the price of anything in it was; but there was a little\r\ngreasy memorandum-book kept in a drawer, which served as a Catalogue\r\nof Prices, and by this oracle Biddy arranged all the shop transactions.\r\nBiddy was Mr. Wopsle\xe2\x80\x99s great-aunt\xe2\x80\x99s granddaughter; I confess myself\r\nquite unequal to the working out of the problem, what relation she was\r\nto Mr. Wopsle. She was an orphan like myself; like me, too, had been\r\nbrought up by hand. She was most noticeable, I thought, in respect of\r\nher extremities; for, her hair always wanted brushing, her hands always\r\nwanted washing, and her shoes always wanted mending and pulling up at\r\nheel. This description must be received with a week-day limitation. On\r\nSundays, she went to church elaborated.\r\n\r\nMuch of my unassisted self, and more by the help of Biddy than of Mr.\r\nWopsle\xe2\x80\x99s great-aunt, I struggled through the alphabet as if it had been\r\na bramble-bush; getting considerably worried and scratched by every\r\nletter. After that I fell among those thieves, the nine figures, who\r\nseemed every evening to do something new to disguise themselves and\r\nbaffle recognition. But, at last I began, in a purblind groping way, to\r\nread, write, and cipher, on the very smallest scale.\r\n\r\nOne night I was sitting in the chimney corner with my slate, expending\r\ngreat efforts on the production of a letter to Joe. I think it must have\r\nbeen a full year after our hunt upon the marshes, for it was a long\r\ntime after, and it was winter and a hard frost. With an alphabet on the\r\nhearth at my feet for reference, I contrived in an hour or two to print\r\nand smear this epistle:--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMI DEER JO i OPE U R KRWITE WELL i OPE i SHAL SON B HABELL 4 2 TEEDGE\r\nU JO AN THEN WE SHORL B SO GLODD AN WEN i M PRENGTD 2 U JO WOT LARX AN\r\nBLEVE ME INF XN PIP.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was no indispensable necessity for my communicating with Joe by\r\nletter, inasmuch as he sat beside me and we were alone. But I delivered\r\nthis written communication (slate and all) with my own hand, and Joe\r\nreceived it as a miracle of erudition.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say, Pip, old chap!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Joe, opening his blue eyes wide, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat a\r\nscholar you are! An\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should like to be,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, glancing at the slate as he held it; with\r\na misgiving that the writing was rather hilly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, here\xe2\x80\x99s a J,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe, \xe2\x80\x9cand a O equal to anythink! Here\xe2\x80\x99s a J and\r\na O, Pip, and a J-O, Joe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI had never heard Joe read aloud to any greater extent than this\r\nmonosyllable, and I had observed at church last Sunday, when I\r\naccidentally held our Prayer-Book upside down, that it seemed to suit\r\nhis convenience quite as well as if it had been all right. Wishing to\r\nembrace the present occasion of finding out whether in teaching Joe, I\r\nshould have to begin quite at the beginning, I said, \xe2\x80\x9cAh! But read the\r\nrest, Jo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe rest, eh, Pip?\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe, looking at it with a slow, searching eye,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne, two, three. Why, here\xe2\x80\x99s three Js, and three Os, and three J-O,\r\nJoes in it, Pip!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI leaned over Joe, and, with the aid of my forefinger read him the whole\r\nletter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAstonishing!\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe, when I had finished. \xe2\x80\x9cYou ARE a scholar.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do you spell Gargery, Joe?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked him, with a modest patronage.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t spell it at all,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut supposing you did?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt can\xe2\x80\x99t be supposed,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe. \xe2\x80\x9cTho\xe2\x80\x99 I\xe2\x80\x99m uncommon fond of reading,\r\ntoo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you, Joe?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn-common. Give me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe, \xe2\x80\x9ca good book, or a good newspaper, and\r\nsit me down afore a good fire, and I ask no better. Lord!\xe2\x80\x9d he continued,\r\nafter rubbing his knees a little, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen you do come to a J and a O, and\r\nsays you, \xe2\x80\x98Here, at last, is a J-O, Joe,\xe2\x80\x99 how interesting reading is!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI derived from this, that Joe\xe2\x80\x99s education, like Steam, was yet in its\r\ninfancy. Pursuing the subject, I inquired,--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDidn\xe2\x80\x99t you ever go to school, Joe, when you were as little as me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Pip.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy didn\xe2\x80\x99t you ever go to school, Joe, when you were as little as me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Pip,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe, taking up the poker, and settling himself to\r\nhis usual occupation when he was thoughtful, of slowly raking the fire\r\nbetween the lower bars; \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you. My father, Pip, he were given\r\nto drink, and when he were overtook with drink, he hammered away at\r\nmy mother, most onmerciful. It were a\xe2\x80\x99most the only hammering he did,\r\nindeed, \xe2\x80\x98xcepting at myself. And he hammered at me with a wigor only\r\nto be equalled by the wigor with which he didn\xe2\x80\x99t hammer at his\r\nanwil.--You\xe2\x80\x99re a listening and understanding, Pip?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Joe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Consequence, my mother and me we ran away from my father several\r\ntimes; and then my mother she\xe2\x80\x99d go out to work, and she\xe2\x80\x99d say, \xe2\x80\x9cJoe,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n she\xe2\x80\x99d say, \xe2\x80\x9cnow, please God, you shall have some schooling, child,\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\nshe\xe2\x80\x99d put me to school. But my father were that good in his hart that\r\nhe couldn\xe2\x80\x99t abear to be without us. So, he\xe2\x80\x99d come with a most tremenjous\r\ncrowd and make such a row at the doors of the houses where we was, that\r\nthey used to be obligated to have no more to do with us and to give us\r\nup to him. And then he took us home and hammered us. Which, you see,\r\nPip,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe, pausing in his meditative raking of the fire, and\r\nlooking at me, \xe2\x80\x9cwere a drawback on my learning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly, poor Joe!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThough mind you, Pip,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe, with a judicial touch or two of the\r\npoker on the top bar, \xe2\x80\x9crendering unto all their doo, and maintaining\r\nequal justice betwixt man and man, my father were that good in his hart,\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t you see?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI didn\xe2\x80\x99t see; but I didn\xe2\x80\x99t say so.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell!\xe2\x80\x9d Joe pursued, \xe2\x80\x9csomebody must keep the pot a biling, Pip, or the\r\npot won\xe2\x80\x99t bile, don\xe2\x80\x99t you know?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI saw that, and said so.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Consequence, my father didn\xe2\x80\x99t make objections to my going to work; so\r\nI went to work at my present calling, which were his too, if he\r\nwould have followed it, and I worked tolerable hard, I assure you, Pip.\r\nIn time I were able to keep him, and I kep him till he went off in a\r\npurple leptic fit. And it were my intentions to have had put upon his\r\ntombstone that, Whatsume\xe2\x80\x99er the failings on his part, Remember reader he\r\nwere that good in his heart.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJoe recited this couplet with such manifest pride and careful\r\nperspicuity, that I asked him if he had made it himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI made it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe, \xe2\x80\x9cmy own self. I made it in a moment. It was like\r\nstriking out a horseshoe complete, in a single blow. I never was so much\r\nsurprised in all my life,--couldn\xe2\x80\x99t credit my own ed,--to tell you the\r\ntruth, hardly believed it were my own ed. As I was saying, Pip, it were\r\nmy intentions to have had it cut over him; but poetry costs money, cut\r\nit how you will, small or large, and it were not done. Not to mention\r\nbearers, all the money that could be spared were wanted for my mother.\r\nShe were in poor elth, and quite broke. She weren\xe2\x80\x99t long of following,\r\npoor soul, and her share of peace come round at last.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJoe\xe2\x80\x99s blue eyes turned a little watery; he rubbed first one of them, and\r\nthen the other, in a most uncongenial and uncomfortable manner, with the\r\nround knob on the top of the poker.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt were but lonesome then,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe, \xe2\x80\x9cliving here alone, and I got\r\nacquainted with your sister. Now, Pip,\xe2\x80\x9d--Joe looked firmly at me as\r\nif he knew I was not going to agree with him;--\xe2\x80\x9cyour sister is a fine\r\nfigure of a woman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI could not help looking at the fire, in an obvious state of doubt.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhatever family opinions, or whatever the world\xe2\x80\x99s opinions, on that\r\nsubject may be, Pip, your sister is,\xe2\x80\x9d Joe tapped the top bar with the\r\npoker after every word following, \xe2\x80\x9ca-fine-figure--of--a--woman!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI could think of nothing better to say than \xe2\x80\x9cI am glad you think so,\r\nJoe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo am I,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Joe, catching me up. \xe2\x80\x9cI am glad I think so, Pip. A\r\nlittle redness or a little matter of Bone, here or there, what does it\r\nsignify to Me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI sagaciously observed, if it didn\xe2\x80\x99t signify to him, to whom did it\r\nsignify?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly!\xe2\x80\x9d assented Joe. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s it. You\xe2\x80\x99re right, old chap! When I\r\ngot acquainted with your sister, it were the talk how she was bringing\r\nyou up by hand. Very kind of her too, all the folks said, and I said,\r\nalong with all the folks. As to you,\xe2\x80\x9d Joe pursued with a countenance\r\nexpressive of seeing something very nasty indeed, \xe2\x80\x9cif you could have\r\nbeen aware how small and flabby and mean you was, dear me, you\xe2\x80\x99d have\r\nformed the most contemptible opinion of yourself!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNot exactly relishing this, I said, \xe2\x80\x9cNever mind me, Joe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I did mind you, Pip,\xe2\x80\x9d he returned with tender simplicity. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen\r\nI offered to your sister to keep company, and to be asked in church at\r\nsuch times as she was willing and ready to come to the forge, I said to\r\nher, \xe2\x80\x98And bring the poor little child. God bless the poor little child,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nI said to your sister, \xe2\x80\x98there\xe2\x80\x99s room for him at the forge!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI broke out crying and begging pardon, and hugged Joe round the neck:\r\nwho dropped the poker to hug me, and to say, \xe2\x80\x9cEver the best of friends;\r\nan\xe2\x80\x99t us, Pip? Don\xe2\x80\x99t cry, old chap!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen this little interruption was over, Joe resumed:--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you see, Pip, and here we are! That\xe2\x80\x99s about where it lights; here\r\nwe are! Now, when you take me in hand in my learning, Pip (and I tell\r\nyou beforehand I am awful dull, most awful dull), Mrs. Joe mustn\xe2\x80\x99t see\r\ntoo much of what we\xe2\x80\x99re up to. It must be done, as I may say, on the sly.\r\nAnd why on the sly? I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you why, Pip.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had taken up the poker again; without which, I doubt if he could have\r\nproceeded in his demonstration.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour sister is given to government.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGiven to government, Joe?\xe2\x80\x9d I was startled, for I had some shadowy idea\r\n(and I am afraid I must add, hope) that Joe had divorced her in a favor\r\nof the Lords of the Admiralty, or Treasury.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGiven to government,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe. \xe2\x80\x9cWhich I meantersay the government of\r\nyou and myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd she an\xe2\x80\x99t over partial to having scholars on the premises,\xe2\x80\x9d Joe\r\ncontinued, \xe2\x80\x9cand in partickler would not be over partial to my being a\r\nscholar, for fear as I might rise. Like a sort of rebel, don\xe2\x80\x99t you see?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI was going to retort with an inquiry, and had got as far as \xe2\x80\x9cWhy--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n when Joe stopped me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStay a bit. I know what you\xe2\x80\x99re a going to say, Pip; stay a bit! I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ndeny that your sister comes the Mo-gul over us, now and again. I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ndeny that she do throw us back-falls, and that she do drop down upon us\r\nheavy. At such times as when your sister is on the Ram-page, Pip,\xe2\x80\x9d Joe\r\nsank his voice to a whisper and glanced at the door, \xe2\x80\x9ccandor compels fur\r\nto admit that she is a Buster.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJoe pronounced this word, as if it began with at least twelve capital\r\nBs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy don\xe2\x80\x99t I rise? That were your observation when I broke it off, Pip?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Joe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe, passing the poker in to his left hand, that he might\r\nfeel his whisker; and I had no hope of him whenever he took to that\r\nplacid occupation; \xe2\x80\x9cyour sister\xe2\x80\x99s a master-mind. A master-mind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s that?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked, in some hope of bringing him to a stand. But\r\nJoe was readier with his definition than I had expected, and completely\r\nstopped me by arguing circularly, and answering with a fixed look,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I ain\xe2\x80\x99t a master-mind,\xe2\x80\x9d Joe resumed, when he had unfixed his look,\r\nand got back to his whisker. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd last of all, Pip,--and this I want to\r\nsay very serious to you, old chap,--I see so much in my poor mother,\r\nof a woman drudging and slaving and breaking her honest hart and never\r\ngetting no peace in her mortal days, that I\xe2\x80\x99m dead afeerd of going wrong\r\nin the way of not doing what\xe2\x80\x99s right by a woman, and I\xe2\x80\x99d fur rather\r\nof the two go wrong the t\xe2\x80\x99other way, and be a little ill-conwenienced\r\nmyself. I wish it was only me that got put out, Pip; I wish there warn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nno Tickler for you, old chap; I wish I could take it all on myself;\r\nbut this is the up-and-down-and-straight on it, Pip, and I hope you\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\noverlook shortcomings.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nYoung as I was, I believe that I dated a new admiration of Joe from that\r\nnight. We were equals afterwards, as we had been before; but, afterwards\r\nat quiet times when I sat looking at Joe and thinking about him, I had\r\na new sensation of feeling conscious that I was looking up to Joe in my\r\nheart.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHowever,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe, rising to replenish the fire; \xe2\x80\x9chere\xe2\x80\x99s the\r\nDutch-clock a working himself up to being equal to strike Eight of \xe2\x80\x98em,\r\nand she\xe2\x80\x99s not come home yet! I hope Uncle Pumblechook\xe2\x80\x99s mare mayn\xe2\x80\x99t have\r\nset a forefoot on a piece o\xe2\x80\x99 ice, and gone down.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Joe made occasional trips with Uncle Pumblechook on market-days,\r\nto assist him in buying such household stuffs and goods as required a\r\nwoman\xe2\x80\x99s judgment; Uncle Pumblechook being a bachelor and reposing no\r\nconfidences in his domestic servant. This was market-day, and Mrs. Joe\r\nwas out on one of these expeditions.\r\n\r\nJoe made the fire and swept the hearth, and then we went to the door to\r\nlisten for the chaise-cart. It was a dry cold night, and the wind blew\r\nkeenly, and the frost was white and hard. A man would die to-night of\r\nlying out on the marshes, I thought. And then I looked at the stars, and\r\nconsidered how awful it would be for a man to turn his face up to them\r\nas he froze to death, and see no help or pity in all the glittering\r\nmultitude.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere comes the mare,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe, \xe2\x80\x9cringing like a peal of bells!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe sound of her iron shoes upon the hard road was quite musical, as she\r\ncame along at a much brisker trot than usual. We got a chair out, ready\r\nfor Mrs. Joe\xe2\x80\x99s alighting, and stirred up the fire that they might see a\r\nbright window, and took a final survey of the kitchen that nothing might\r\nbe out of its place. When we had completed these preparations, they\r\ndrove up, wrapped to the eyes. Mrs. Joe was soon landed, and Uncle\r\nPumblechook was soon down too, covering the mare with a cloth, and we\r\nwere soon all in the kitchen, carrying so much cold air in with us that\r\nit seemed to drive all the heat out of the fire.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Joe, unwrapping herself with haste and excitement, and\r\nthrowing her bonnet back on her shoulders where it hung by the strings,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cif this boy ain\xe2\x80\x99t grateful this night, he never will be!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI looked as grateful as any boy possibly could, who was wholly\r\nuninformed why he ought to assume that expression.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s only to be hoped,\xe2\x80\x9d said my sister, \xe2\x80\x9cthat he won\xe2\x80\x99t be Pompeyed. But\r\nI have my fears.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe ain\xe2\x80\x99t in that line, Mum,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Pumblechook. \xe2\x80\x9cShe knows better.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe? I looked at Joe, making the motion with my lips and eyebrows,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe?\xe2\x80\x9d Joe looked at me, making the motion with his lips and eyebrows,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe?\xe2\x80\x9d My sister catching him in the act, he drew the back of his hand\r\nacross his nose with his usual conciliatory air on such occasions, and\r\nlooked at her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d said my sister, in her snappish way. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you staring at?\r\nIs the house afire?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c--Which some individual,\xe2\x80\x9d Joe politely hinted, \xe2\x80\x9cmentioned--she.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd she is a she, I suppose?\xe2\x80\x9d said my sister. \xe2\x80\x9cUnless you call Miss\r\nHavisham a he. And I doubt if even you\xe2\x80\x99ll go so far as that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Havisham, up town?\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs there any Miss Havisham down town?\xe2\x80\x9d returned my sister.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe wants this boy to go and play there. And of course he\xe2\x80\x99s going. And\r\nhe had better play there,\xe2\x80\x9d said my sister, shaking her head at me as an\r\nencouragement to be extremely light and sportive, \xe2\x80\x9cor I\xe2\x80\x99ll work him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI had heard of Miss Havisham up town,--everybody for miles round had\r\nheard of Miss Havisham up town,--as an immensely rich and grim lady who\r\nlived in a large and dismal house barricaded against robbers, and who\r\nled a life of seclusion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell to be sure!\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe, astounded. \xe2\x80\x9cI wonder how she come to know\r\nPip!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNoodle!\xe2\x80\x9d cried my sister. \xe2\x80\x9cWho said she knew him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c--Which some individual,\xe2\x80\x9d Joe again politely hinted, \xe2\x80\x9cmentioned that\r\nshe wanted him to go and play there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd couldn\xe2\x80\x99t she ask Uncle Pumblechook if he knew of a boy to go and\r\nplay there? Isn\xe2\x80\x99t it just barely possible that Uncle Pumblechook may be\r\na tenant of hers, and that he may sometimes--we won\xe2\x80\x99t say quarterly\r\nor half-yearly, for that would be requiring too much of you--but\r\nsometimes--go there to pay his rent? And couldn\xe2\x80\x99t she then ask Uncle\r\nPumblechook if he knew of a boy to go and play there? And couldn\xe2\x80\x99t Uncle\r\nPumblechook, being always considerate and thoughtful for us--though you\r\nmay not think it, Joseph,\xe2\x80\x9d in a tone of the deepest reproach, as if\r\nhe were the most callous of nephews, \xe2\x80\x9cthen mention this boy, standing\r\nPrancing here\xe2\x80\x9d--which I solemnly declare I was not doing--\xe2\x80\x9cthat I have\r\nfor ever been a willing slave to?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood again!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Uncle Pumblechook. \xe2\x80\x9cWell put! Prettily pointed! Good\r\nindeed! Now Joseph, you know the case.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Joseph,\xe2\x80\x9d said my sister, still in a reproachful manner, while Joe\r\napologetically drew the back of his hand across and across his nose,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cyou do not yet--though you may not think it--know the case. You may\r\nconsider that you do, but you do not, Joseph. For you do not know that\r\nUncle Pumblechook, being sensible that for anything we can tell, this\r\nboy\xe2\x80\x99s fortune may be made by his going to Miss Havisham\xe2\x80\x99s, has offered\r\nto take him into town to-night in his own chaise-cart, and to keep\r\nhim to-night, and to take him with his own hands to Miss Havisham\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nto-morrow morning. And Lor-a-mussy me!\xe2\x80\x9d cried my sister, casting off her\r\nbonnet in sudden desperation, \xe2\x80\x9chere I stand talking to mere Mooncalfs,\r\nwith Uncle Pumblechook waiting, and the mare catching cold at the door,\r\nand the boy grimed with crock and dirt from the hair of his head to the\r\nsole of his foot!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith that, she pounced upon me, like an eagle on a lamb, and my face was\r\nsqueezed into wooden bowls in sinks, and my head was put under taps of\r\nwater-butts, and I was soaped, and kneaded, and towelled, and thumped,\r\nand harrowed, and rasped, until I really was quite beside myself. (I\r\nmay here remark that I suppose myself to be better acquainted than\r\nany living authority, with the ridgy effect of a wedding-ring, passing\r\nunsympathetically over the human countenance.)\r\n\r\nWhen my ablutions were completed, I was put into clean linen of the\r\nstiffest character, like a young penitent into sackcloth, and was\r\ntrussed up in my tightest and fearfullest suit. I was then delivered\r\nover to Mr. Pumblechook, who formally received me as if he were the\r\nSheriff, and who let off upon me the speech that I knew he had been\r\ndying to make all along: \xe2\x80\x9cBoy, be forever grateful to all friends, but\r\nespecially unto them which brought you up by hand!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-bye, Joe!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGod bless you, Pip, old chap!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI had never parted from him before, and what with my feelings and what\r\nwith soapsuds, I could at first see no stars from the chaise-cart.\r\nBut they twinkled out one by one, without throwing any light on the\r\nquestions why on earth I was going to play at Miss Havisham\xe2\x80\x99s, and what\r\non earth I was expected to play at.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter VIII\r\n\r\nMr. Pumblechook\xe2\x80\x99s premises in the High Street of the market town,\r\nwere of a peppercorny and farinaceous character, as the premises of a\r\ncornchandler and seedsman should be. It appeared to me that he must be a\r\nvery happy man indeed, to have so many little drawers in his shop; and\r\nI wondered when I peeped into one or two on the lower tiers, and saw the\r\ntied-up brown paper packets inside, whether the flower-seeds and bulbs\r\never wanted of a fine day to break out of those jails, and bloom.\r\n\r\nIt was in the early morning after my arrival that I entertained this\r\nspeculation. On the previous night, I had been sent straight to bed in\r\nan attic with a sloping roof, which was so low in the corner where the\r\nbedstead was, that I calculated the tiles as being within a foot of my\r\neyebrows. In the same early morning, I discovered a singular affinity\r\nbetween seeds and corduroys. Mr. Pumblechook wore corduroys, and so did\r\nhis shopman; and somehow, there was a general air and flavor about the\r\ncorduroys, so much in the nature of seeds, and a general air and flavor\r\nabout the seeds, so much in the nature of corduroys, that I hardly knew\r\nwhich was which. The same opportunity served me for noticing that Mr.\r\nPumblechook appeared to conduct his business by looking across the\r\nstreet at the saddler, who appeared to transact his business by keeping\r\nhis eye on the coachmaker, who appeared to get on in life by putting his\r\nhands in his pockets and contemplating the baker, who in his turn folded\r\nhis arms and stared at the grocer, who stood at his door and yawned at\r\nthe chemist. The watchmaker, always poring over a little desk with\r\na magnifying-glass at his eye, and always inspected by a group of\r\nsmock-frocks poring over him through the glass of his shop-window,\r\nseemed to be about the only person in the High Street whose trade\r\nengaged his attention.\r\n\r\nMr. Pumblechook and I breakfasted at eight o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the parlor behind\r\nthe shop, while the shopman took his mug of tea and hunch of bread\r\nand butter on a sack of peas in the front premises. I considered Mr.\r\nPumblechook wretched company. Besides being possessed by my sister\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nidea that a mortifying and penitential character ought to be imparted\r\nto my diet,--besides giving me as much crumb as possible in combination\r\nwith as little butter, and putting such a quantity of warm water into\r\nmy milk that it would have been more candid to have left the milk out\r\naltogether,--his conversation consisted of nothing but arithmetic. On\r\nmy politely bidding him Good morning, he said, pompously, \xe2\x80\x9cSeven times\r\nnine, boy?\xe2\x80\x9d And how should I be able to answer, dodged in that way, in\r\na strange place, on an empty stomach! I was hungry, but before I had\r\nswallowed a morsel, he began a running sum that lasted all through the\r\nbreakfast. \xe2\x80\x9cSeven?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cAnd four?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cAnd eight?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cAnd six?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cAnd two?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cAnd\r\nten?\xe2\x80\x9d And so on. And after each figure was disposed of, it was as much\r\nas I could do to get a bite or a sup, before the next came; while he sat\r\nat his ease guessing nothing, and eating bacon and hot roll, in (if I\r\nmay be allowed the expression) a gorging and gormandizing manner.\r\n\r\nFor such reasons, I was very glad when ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock came and we started\r\nfor Miss Havisham\xe2\x80\x99s; though I was not at all at my ease regarding the\r\nmanner in which I should acquit myself under that lady\xe2\x80\x99s roof. Within\r\na quarter of an hour we came to Miss Havisham\xe2\x80\x99s house, which was of old\r\nbrick, and dismal, and had a great many iron bars to it. Some of the\r\nwindows had been walled up; of those that remained, all the lower were\r\nrustily barred. There was a courtyard in front, and that was barred; so\r\nwe had to wait, after ringing the bell, until some one should come\r\nto open it. While we waited at the gate, I peeped in (even then Mr.\r\nPumblechook said, \xe2\x80\x9cAnd fourteen?\xe2\x80\x9d but I pretended not to hear him), and\r\nsaw that at the side of the house there was a large brewery. No brewing\r\nwas going on in it, and none seemed to have gone on for a long long\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nA window was raised, and a clear voice demanded \xe2\x80\x9cWhat name?\xe2\x80\x9d To which my\r\nconductor replied, \xe2\x80\x9cPumblechook.\xe2\x80\x9d The voice returned, \xe2\x80\x9cQuite right,\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\nthe window was shut again, and a young lady came across the court-yard,\r\nwith keys in her hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Pumblechook, \xe2\x80\x9cis Pip.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is Pip, is it?\xe2\x80\x9d returned the young lady, who was very pretty and\r\nseemed very proud; \xe2\x80\x9ccome in, Pip.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Pumblechook was coming in also, when she stopped him with the gate.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cDid you wish to see Miss Havisham?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf Miss Havisham wished to see me,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Mr. Pumblechook,\r\ndiscomfited.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d said the girl; \xe2\x80\x9cbut you see she don\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe said it so finally, and in such an undiscussible way, that Mr.\r\nPumblechook, though in a condition of ruffled dignity, could not\r\nprotest. But he eyed me severely,--as if I had done anything to\r\nhim!--and departed with the words reproachfully delivered: \xe2\x80\x9cBoy! Let\r\nyour behavior here be a credit unto them which brought you up by hand!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n I was not free from apprehension that he would come back to propound\r\nthrough the gate, \xe2\x80\x9cAnd sixteen?\xe2\x80\x9d But he didn\xe2\x80\x99t.\r\n\r\nMy young conductress locked the gate, and we went across the courtyard.\r\nIt was paved and clean, but grass was growing in every crevice. The\r\nbrewery buildings had a little lane of communication with it, and the\r\nwooden gates of that lane stood open, and all the brewery beyond stood\r\nopen, away to the high enclosing wall; and all was empty and disused.\r\nThe cold wind seemed to blow colder there than outside the gate; and\r\nit made a shrill noise in howling in and out at the open sides of the\r\nbrewery, like the noise of wind in the rigging of a ship at sea.\r\n\r\nShe saw me looking at it, and she said, \xe2\x80\x9cYou could drink without hurt\r\nall the strong beer that\xe2\x80\x99s brewed there now, boy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should think I could, miss,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, in a shy way.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBetter not try to brew beer there now, or it would turn out sour, boy;\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t you think so?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt looks like it, miss.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot that anybody means to try,\xe2\x80\x9d she added, \xe2\x80\x9cfor that\xe2\x80\x99s all done with,\r\nand the place will stand as idle as it is till it falls. As to strong\r\nbeer, there\xe2\x80\x99s enough of it in the cellars already, to drown the Manor\r\nHouse.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs that the name of this house, miss?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne of its names, boy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt has more than one, then, miss?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne more. Its other name was Satis; which is Greek, or Latin, or\r\nHebrew, or all three--or all one to me--for enough.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEnough House,\xe2\x80\x9d said I; \xe2\x80\x9cthat\xe2\x80\x99s a curious name, miss.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied; \xe2\x80\x9cbut it meant more than it said. It meant, when it\r\nwas given, that whoever had this house could want nothing else. They\r\nmust have been easily satisfied in those days, I should think. But don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nloiter, boy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThough she called me \xe2\x80\x9cboy\xe2\x80\x9d so often, and with a carelessness that was\r\nfar from complimentary, she was of about my own age. She seemed much\r\nolder than I, of course, being a girl, and beautiful and self-possessed;\r\nand she was as scornful of me as if she had been one-and-twenty, and a\r\nqueen.\r\n\r\nWe went into the house by a side door, the great front entrance had two\r\nchains across it outside,--and the first thing I noticed was, that the\r\npassages were all dark, and that she had left a candle burning there.\r\nShe took it up, and we went through more passages and up a staircase,\r\nand still it was all dark, and only the candle lighted us.\r\n\r\nAt last we came to the door of a room, and she said, \xe2\x80\x9cGo in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI answered, more in shyness than politeness, \xe2\x80\x9cAfter you, miss.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo this she returned: \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t be ridiculous, boy; I am not going in.\xe2\x80\x9d And\r\nscornfully walked away, and--what was worse--took the candle with her.\r\n\r\nThis was very uncomfortable, and I was half afraid. However, the only\r\nthing to be done being to knock at the door, I knocked, and was told\r\nfrom within to enter. I entered, therefore, and found myself in a pretty\r\nlarge room, well lighted with wax candles. No glimpse of daylight was to\r\nbe seen in it. It was a dressing-room, as I supposed from the furniture,\r\nthough much of it was of forms and uses then quite unknown to me. But\r\nprominent in it was a draped table with a gilded looking-glass, and that\r\nI made out at first sight to be a fine lady\xe2\x80\x99s dressing-table.\r\n\r\nWhether I should have made out this object so soon if there had been no\r\nfine lady sitting at it, I cannot say. In an arm-chair, with an\r\nelbow resting on the table and her head leaning on that hand, sat the\r\nstrangest lady I have ever seen, or shall ever see.\r\n\r\nShe was dressed in rich materials,--satins, and lace, and silks,--all\r\nof white. Her shoes were white. And she had a long white veil dependent\r\nfrom her hair, and she had bridal flowers in her hair, but her hair was\r\nwhite. Some bright jewels sparkled on her neck and on her hands, and\r\nsome other jewels lay sparkling on the table. Dresses, less splendid\r\nthan the dress she wore, and half-packed trunks, were scattered about.\r\nShe had not quite finished dressing, for she had but one shoe on,--the\r\nother was on the table near her hand,--her veil was but half arranged,\r\nher watch and chain were not put on, and some lace for her bosom lay\r\nwith those trinkets, and with her handkerchief, and gloves, and\r\nsome flowers, and a Prayer-Book all confusedly heaped about the\r\nlooking-glass.\r\n\r\nIt was not in the first few moments that I saw all these things, though\r\nI saw more of them in the first moments than might be supposed. But I\r\nsaw that everything within my view which ought to be white, had been\r\nwhite long ago, and had lost its lustre and was faded and yellow. I saw\r\nthat the bride within the bridal dress had withered like the dress, and\r\nlike the flowers, and had no brightness left but the brightness of her\r\nsunken eyes. I saw that the dress had been put upon the rounded figure\r\nof a young woman, and that the figure upon which it now hung loose had\r\nshrunk to skin and bone. Once, I had been taken to see some ghastly\r\nwaxwork at the Fair, representing I know not what impossible personage\r\nlying in state. Once, I had been taken to one of our old marsh churches\r\nto see a skeleton in the ashes of a rich dress that had been dug out of\r\na vault under the church pavement. Now, waxwork and skeleton seemed to\r\nhave dark eyes that moved and looked at me. I should have cried out, if\r\nI could.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho is it?\xe2\x80\x9d said the lady at the table.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPip, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPip?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Pumblechook\xe2\x80\x99s boy, ma\xe2\x80\x99am. Come--to play.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome nearer; let me look at you. Come close.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was when I stood before her, avoiding her eyes, that I took note of\r\nthe surrounding objects in detail, and saw that her watch had stopped\r\nat twenty minutes to nine, and that a clock in the room had stopped at\r\ntwenty minutes to nine.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook at me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Havisham. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are not afraid of a woman who has\r\nnever seen the sun since you were born?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI regret to state that I was not afraid of telling the enormous lie\r\ncomprehended in the answer \xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know what I touch here?\xe2\x80\x9d she said, laying her hands, one upon\r\nthe other, on her left side.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.\xe2\x80\x9d (It made me think of the young man.)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do I touch?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour heart.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBroken!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe uttered the word with an eager look, and with strong emphasis, and\r\nwith a weird smile that had a kind of boast in it. Afterwards she kept\r\nher hands there for a little while, and slowly took them away as if they\r\nwere heavy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am tired,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Havisham. \xe2\x80\x9cI want diversion, and I have done\r\nwith men and women. Play.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI think it will be conceded by my most disputatious reader, that she\r\ncould hardly have directed an unfortunate boy to do anything in the wide\r\nworld more difficult to be done under the circumstances.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI sometimes have sick fancies,\xe2\x80\x9d she went on, \xe2\x80\x9cand I have a sick fancy\r\nthat I want to see some play. There, there!\xe2\x80\x9d with an impatient movement\r\nof the fingers of her right hand; \xe2\x80\x9cplay, play, play!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor a moment, with the fear of my sister\xe2\x80\x99s working me before my eyes, I\r\nhad a desperate idea of starting round the room in the assumed character\r\nof Mr. Pumblechook\xe2\x80\x99s chaise-cart. But I felt myself so unequal to the\r\nperformance that I gave it up, and stood looking at Miss Havisham in\r\nwhat I suppose she took for a dogged manner, inasmuch as she said, when\r\nwe had taken a good look at each other,--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you sullen and obstinate?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, I am very sorry for you, and very sorry I can\xe2\x80\x99t play just\r\nnow. If you complain of me I shall get into trouble with my sister, so\r\nI would do it if I could; but it\xe2\x80\x99s so new here, and so strange, and so\r\nfine,--and melancholy--.\xe2\x80\x9d I stopped, fearing I might say too much, or\r\nhad already said it, and we took another look at each other.\r\n\r\nBefore she spoke again, she turned her eyes from me, and looked at the\r\ndress she wore, and at the dressing-table, and finally at herself in the\r\nlooking-glass.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo new to him,\xe2\x80\x9d she muttered, \xe2\x80\x9cso old to me; so strange to him, so\r\nfamiliar to me; so melancholy to both of us! Call Estella.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs she was still looking at the reflection of herself, I thought she was\r\nstill talking to herself, and kept quiet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCall Estella,\xe2\x80\x9d she repeated, flashing a look at me. \xe2\x80\x9cYou can do that.\r\nCall Estella. At the door.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo stand in the dark in a mysterious passage of an unknown house,\r\nbawling Estella to a scornful young lady neither visible nor responsive,\r\nand feeling it a dreadful liberty so to roar out her name, was almost\r\nas bad as playing to order. But she answered at last, and her light came\r\nalong the dark passage like a star.\r\n\r\nMiss Havisham beckoned her to come close, and took up a jewel from the\r\ntable, and tried its effect upon her fair young bosom and against her\r\npretty brown hair. \xe2\x80\x9cYour own, one day, my dear, and you will use it\r\nwell. Let me see you play cards with this boy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith this boy? Why, he is a common laboring boy!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI thought I overheard Miss Havisham answer,--only it seemed so\r\nunlikely,--\xe2\x80\x9cWell? You can break his heart.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you play, boy?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Estella of myself, with the greatest\r\ndisdain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing but beggar my neighbor, miss.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBeggar him,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Havisham to Estella. So we sat down to cards.\r\n\r\nIt was then I began to understand that everything in the room had\r\nstopped, like the watch and the clock, a long time ago. I noticed that\r\nMiss Havisham put down the jewel exactly on the spot from which she had\r\ntaken it up. As Estella dealt the cards, I glanced at the dressing-table\r\nagain, and saw that the shoe upon it, once white, now yellow, had never\r\nbeen worn. I glanced down at the foot from which the shoe was absent,\r\nand saw that the silk stocking on it, once white, now yellow, had been\r\ntrodden ragged. Without this arrest of everything, this standing still\r\nof all the pale decayed objects, not even the withered bridal dress on\r\nthe collapsed form could have looked so like grave-clothes, or the long\r\nveil so like a shroud.\r\n\r\nSo she sat, corpse-like, as we played at cards; the frillings and\r\ntrimmings on her bridal dress, looking like earthy paper. I knew nothing\r\nthen of the discoveries that are occasionally made of bodies buried in\r\nancient times, which fall to powder in the moment of being distinctly\r\nseen; but, I have often thought since, that she must have looked as if\r\nthe admission of the natural light of day would have struck her to dust.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe calls the knaves Jacks, this boy!\xe2\x80\x9d said Estella with disdain, before\r\nour first game was out. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd what coarse hands he has! And what thick\r\nboots!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI had never thought of being ashamed of my hands before; but I began\r\nto consider them a very indifferent pair. Her contempt for me was so\r\nstrong, that it became infectious, and I caught it.\r\n\r\nShe won the game, and I dealt. I misdealt, as was only natural, when I\r\nknew she was lying in wait for me to do wrong; and she denounced me for\r\na stupid, clumsy laboring-boy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou say nothing of her,\xe2\x80\x9d remarked Miss Havisham to me, as she looked\r\non. \xe2\x80\x9cShe says many hard things of you, but you say nothing of her. What\r\ndo you think of her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t like to say,\xe2\x80\x9d I stammered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell me in my ear,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Havisham, bending down.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think she is very proud,\xe2\x80\x9d I replied, in a whisper.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnything else?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think she is very pretty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnything else?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think she is very insulting.\xe2\x80\x9d (She was looking at me then with a look\r\nof supreme aversion.)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnything else?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think I should like to go home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd never see her again, though she is so pretty?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not sure that I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t like to see her again, but I should like\r\nto go home now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou shall go soon,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Havisham, aloud. \xe2\x80\x9cPlay the game out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSaving for the one weird smile at first, I should have felt almost\r\nsure that Miss Havisham\xe2\x80\x99s face could not smile. It had dropped into a\r\nwatchful and brooding expression,--most likely when all the things about\r\nher had become transfixed,--and it looked as if nothing could ever lift\r\nit up again. Her chest had dropped, so that she stooped; and her voice\r\nhad dropped, so that she spoke low, and with a dead lull upon her;\r\naltogether, she had the appearance of having dropped body and soul,\r\nwithin and without, under the weight of a crushing blow.\r\n\r\nI played the game to an end with Estella, and she beggared me. She\r\nthrew the cards down on the table when she had won them all, as if she\r\ndespised them for having been won of me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen shall I have you here again?\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Havisham. \xe2\x80\x9cLet me think.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI was beginning to remind her that to-day was Wednesday, when she\r\nchecked me with her former impatient movement of the fingers of her\r\nright hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere, there! I know nothing of days of the week; I know nothing of\r\nweeks of the year. Come again after six days. You hear?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEstella, take him down. Let him have something to eat, and let him roam\r\nand look about him while he eats. Go, Pip.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI followed the candle down, as I had followed the candle up, and she\r\nstood it in the place where we had found it. Until she opened the\r\nside entrance, I had fancied, without thinking about it, that it must\r\nnecessarily be night-time. The rush of the daylight quite confounded me,\r\nand made me feel as if I had been in the candlelight of the strange room\r\nmany hours.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are to wait here, you boy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Estella; and disappeared and\r\nclosed the door.\r\n\r\nI took the opportunity of being alone in the courtyard to look at my\r\ncoarse hands and my common boots. My opinion of those accessories was\r\nnot favorable. They had never troubled me before, but they troubled\r\nme now, as vulgar appendages. I determined to ask Joe why he had ever\r\ntaught me to call those picture-cards Jacks, which ought to be called\r\nknaves. I wished Joe had been rather more genteelly brought up, and then\r\nI should have been so too.\r\n\r\nShe came back, with some bread and meat and a little mug of beer. She\r\nput the mug down on the stones of the yard, and gave me the bread\r\nand meat without looking at me, as insolently as if I were a dog in\r\ndisgrace. I was so humiliated, hurt, spurned, offended, angry, sorry,--I\r\ncannot hit upon the right name for the smart--God knows what its name\r\nwas,--that tears started to my eyes. The moment they sprang there, the\r\ngirl looked at me with a quick delight in having been the cause of them.\r\nThis gave me power to keep them back and to look at her: so, she gave a\r\ncontemptuous toss--but with a sense, I thought, of having made too sure\r\nthat I was so wounded--and left me.\r\n\r\nBut when she was gone, I looked about me for a place to hide my face\r\nin, and got behind one of the gates in the brewery-lane, and leaned my\r\nsleeve against the wall there, and leaned my forehead on it and cried.\r\nAs I cried, I kicked the wall, and took a hard twist at my hair; so\r\nbitter were my feelings, and so sharp was the smart without a name, that\r\nneeded counteraction.\r\n\r\nMy sister\xe2\x80\x99s bringing up had made me sensitive. In the little world in\r\nwhich children have their existence whosoever brings them up, there is\r\nnothing so finely perceived and so finely felt as injustice. It may be\r\nonly small injustice that the child can be exposed to; but the child\r\nis small, and its world is small, and its rocking-horse stands as many\r\nhands high, according to scale, as a big-boned Irish hunter. Within\r\nmyself, I had sustained, from my babyhood, a perpetual conflict with\r\ninjustice. I had known, from the time when I could speak, that my\r\nsister, in her capricious and violent coercion, was unjust to me. I had\r\ncherished a profound conviction that her bringing me up by hand gave her\r\nno right to bring me up by jerks. Through all my punishments, disgraces,\r\nfasts, and vigils, and other penitential performances, I had nursed\r\nthis assurance; and to my communing so much with it, in a solitary and\r\nunprotected way, I in great part refer the fact that I was morally timid\r\nand very sensitive.\r\n\r\nI got rid of my injured feelings for the time by kicking them into the\r\nbrewery wall, and twisting them out of my hair, and then I smoothed my\r\nface with my sleeve, and came from behind the gate. The bread and meat\r\nwere acceptable, and the beer was warming and tingling, and I was soon\r\nin spirits to look about me.\r\n\r\nTo be sure, it was a deserted place, down to the pigeon-house in the\r\nbrewery-yard, which had been blown crooked on its pole by some high\r\nwind, and would have made the pigeons think themselves at sea, if there\r\nhad been any pigeons there to be rocked by it. But there were no pigeons\r\nin the dove-cot, no horses in the stable, no pigs in the sty, no malt in\r\nthe storehouse, no smells of grains and beer in the copper or the vat.\r\nAll the uses and scents of the brewery might have evaporated with its\r\nlast reek of smoke. In a by-yard, there was a wilderness of empty casks,\r\nwhich had a certain sour remembrance of better days lingering about\r\nthem; but it was too sour to be accepted as a sample of the beer that\r\nwas gone,--and in this respect I remember those recluses as being like\r\nmost others.\r\n\r\nBehind the furthest end of the brewery, was a rank garden with an old\r\nwall; not so high but that I could struggle up and hold on long enough\r\nto look over it, and see that the rank garden was the garden of the\r\nhouse, and that it was overgrown with tangled weeds, but that there was\r\na track upon the green and yellow paths, as if some one sometimes walked\r\nthere, and that Estella was walking away from me even then. But she\r\nseemed to be everywhere. For when I yielded to the temptation presented\r\nby the casks, and began to walk on them, I saw her walking on them at\r\nthe end of the yard of casks. She had her back towards me, and held her\r\npretty brown hair spread out in her two hands, and never looked round,\r\nand passed out of my view directly. So, in the brewery itself,--by which\r\nI mean the large paved lofty place in which they used to make the beer,\r\nand where the brewing utensils still were. When I first went into it,\r\nand, rather oppressed by its gloom, stood near the door looking about\r\nme, I saw her pass among the extinguished fires, and ascend some light\r\niron stairs, and go out by a gallery high overhead, as if she were going\r\nout into the sky.\r\n\r\nIt was in this place, and at this moment, that a strange thing happened\r\nto my fancy. I thought it a strange thing then, and I thought it a\r\nstranger thing long afterwards. I turned my eyes--a little dimmed by\r\nlooking up at the frosty light--towards a great wooden beam in a low\r\nnook of the building near me on my right hand, and I saw a figure\r\nhanging there by the neck. A figure all in yellow white, with but\r\none shoe to the feet; and it hung so, that I could see that the faded\r\ntrimmings of the dress were like earthy paper, and that the face was\r\nMiss Havisham\xe2\x80\x99s, with a movement going over the whole countenance as if\r\nshe were trying to call to me. In the terror of seeing the figure,\r\nand in the terror of being certain that it had not been there a moment\r\nbefore, I at first ran from it, and then ran towards it. And my terror\r\nwas greatest of all when I found no figure there.\r\n\r\nNothing less than the frosty light of the cheerful sky, the sight of\r\npeople passing beyond the bars of the court-yard gate, and the reviving\r\ninfluence of the rest of the bread and meat and beer, would have brought\r\nme round. Even with those aids, I might not have come to myself as soon\r\nas I did, but that I saw Estella approaching with the keys, to let\r\nme out. She would have some fair reason for looking down upon me, I\r\nthought, if she saw me frightened; and she would have no fair reason.\r\n\r\nShe gave me a triumphant glance in passing me, as if she rejoiced that\r\nmy hands were so coarse and my boots were so thick, and she opened the\r\ngate, and stood holding it. I was passing out without looking at her,\r\nwhen she touched me with a taunting hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy don\xe2\x80\x99t you cry?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou do,\xe2\x80\x9d said she. \xe2\x80\x9cYou have been crying till you are half blind, and\r\nyou are near crying again now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe laughed contemptuously, pushed me out, and locked the gate upon me.\r\nI went straight to Mr. Pumblechook\xe2\x80\x99s, and was immensely relieved to find\r\nhim not at home. So, leaving word with the shopman on what day I was\r\nwanted at Miss Havisham\xe2\x80\x99s again, I set off on the four-mile walk to\r\nour forge; pondering, as I went along, on all I had seen, and deeply\r\nrevolving that I was a common laboring-boy; that my hands were coarse;\r\nthat my boots were thick; that I had fallen into a despicable habit\r\nof calling knaves Jacks; that I was much more ignorant than I had\r\nconsidered myself last night, and generally that I was in a low-lived\r\nbad way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter IX\r\n\r\nWhen I reached home, my sister was very curious to know all about Miss\r\nHavisham\xe2\x80\x99s, and asked a number of questions. And I soon found myself\r\ngetting heavily bumped from behind in the nape of the neck and the small\r\nof the back, and having my face ignominiously shoved against the kitchen\r\nwall, because I did not answer those questions at sufficient length.\r\n\r\nIf a dread of not being understood be hidden in the breasts of other\r\nyoung people to anything like the extent to which it used to be hidden\r\nin mine,--which I consider probable, as I have no particular reason\r\nto suspect myself of having been a monstrosity,--it is the key to many\r\nreservations. I felt convinced that if I described Miss Havisham\xe2\x80\x99s as my\r\neyes had seen it, I should not be understood. Not only that, but I felt\r\nconvinced that Miss Havisham too would not be understood; and although\r\nshe was perfectly incomprehensible to me, I entertained an impression\r\nthat there would be something coarse and treacherous in my dragging\r\nher as she really was (to say nothing of Miss Estella) before the\r\ncontemplation of Mrs. Joe. Consequently, I said as little as I could,\r\nand had my face shoved against the kitchen wall.\r\n\r\nThe worst of it was that that bullying old Pumblechook, preyed upon by\r\na devouring curiosity to be informed of all I had seen and heard, came\r\ngaping over in his chaise-cart at tea-time, to have the details divulged\r\nto him. And the mere sight of the torment, with his fishy eyes and mouth\r\nopen, his sandy hair inquisitively on end, and his waistcoat heaving\r\nwith windy arithmetic, made me vicious in my reticence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, boy,\xe2\x80\x9d Uncle Pumblechook began, as soon as he was seated in the\r\nchair of honor by the fire. \xe2\x80\x9cHow did you get on up town?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI answered, \xe2\x80\x9cPretty well, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d and my sister shook her fist at me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPretty well?\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Pumblechook repeated. \xe2\x80\x9cPretty well is no answer. Tell\r\nus what you mean by pretty well, boy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhitewash on the forehead hardens the brain into a state of obstinacy\r\nperhaps. Anyhow, with whitewash from the wall on my forehead, my\r\nobstinacy was adamantine. I reflected for some time, and then answered\r\nas if I had discovered a new idea, \xe2\x80\x9cI mean pretty well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMy sister with an exclamation of impatience was going to fly at me,--I\r\nhad no shadow of defence, for Joe was busy in the forge,--when Mr.\r\nPumblechook interposed with \xe2\x80\x9cNo! Don\xe2\x80\x99t lose your temper. Leave this\r\nlad to me, ma\xe2\x80\x99am; leave this lad to me.\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Pumblechook then turned me\r\ntowards him, as if he were going to cut my hair, and said,--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFirst (to get our thoughts in order): Forty-three pence?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI calculated the consequences of replying \xe2\x80\x9cFour Hundred Pound,\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\nfinding them against me, went as near the answer as I could--which was\r\nsomewhere about eightpence off. Mr. Pumblechook then put me through my\r\npence-table from \xe2\x80\x9ctwelve pence make one shilling,\xe2\x80\x9d up to \xe2\x80\x9cforty pence\r\nmake three and fourpence,\xe2\x80\x9d and then triumphantly demanded, as if he had\r\ndone for me, \xe2\x80\x9cNow! How much is forty-three pence?\xe2\x80\x9d To which I replied,\r\nafter a long interval of reflection, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\xe2\x80\x9d And I was so\r\naggravated that I almost doubt if I did know.\r\n\r\nMr. Pumblechook worked his head like a screw to screw it out of me,\r\nand said, \xe2\x80\x9cIs forty-three pence seven and sixpence three fardens, for\r\ninstance?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes!\xe2\x80\x9d said I. And although my sister instantly boxed my ears, it was\r\nhighly gratifying to me to see that the answer spoilt his joke, and\r\nbrought him to a dead stop.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBoy! What like is Miss Havisham?\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Pumblechook began again when\r\nhe had recovered; folding his arms tight on his chest and applying the\r\nscrew.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery tall and dark,\xe2\x80\x9d I told him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs she, uncle?\xe2\x80\x9d asked my sister.\r\n\r\nMr. Pumblechook winked assent; from which I at once inferred that he had\r\nnever seen Miss Havisham, for she was nothing of the kind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Pumblechook conceitedly. (\xe2\x80\x9cThis is the way to have him!\r\nWe are beginning to hold our own, I think, Mum?\xe2\x80\x9d)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am sure, uncle,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Mrs. Joe, \xe2\x80\x9cI wish you had him always; you\r\nknow so well how to deal with him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, boy! What was she a doing of, when you went in today?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mr.\r\nPumblechook.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe was sitting,\xe2\x80\x9d I answered, \xe2\x80\x9cin a black velvet coach.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Pumblechook and Mrs. Joe stared at one another--as they well\r\nmight--and both repeated, \xe2\x80\x9cIn a black velvet coach?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said I. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd Miss Estella--that\xe2\x80\x99s her niece, I think--handed her\r\nin cake and wine at the coach-window, on a gold plate. And we all had\r\ncake and wine on gold plates. And I got up behind the coach to eat mine,\r\nbecause she told me to.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWas anybody else there?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mr. Pumblechook.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFour dogs,\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLarge or small?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cImmense,\xe2\x80\x9d said I. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd they fought for veal-cutlets out of a silver\r\nbasket.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Pumblechook and Mrs. Joe stared at one another again, in utter\r\namazement. I was perfectly frantic,--a reckless witness under the\r\ntorture,--and would have told them anything.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere was this coach, in the name of gracious?\xe2\x80\x9d asked my sister.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn Miss Havisham\xe2\x80\x99s room.\xe2\x80\x9d They stared again. \xe2\x80\x9cBut there weren\xe2\x80\x99t any\r\nhorses to it.\xe2\x80\x9d I added this saving clause, in the moment of rejecting\r\nfour richly caparisoned coursers which I had had wild thoughts of\r\nharnessing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan this be possible, uncle?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mrs. Joe. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat can the boy mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you, Mum,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Pumblechook. \xe2\x80\x9cMy opinion is, it\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nsedan-chair. She\xe2\x80\x99s flighty, you know,--very flighty,--quite flighty\r\nenough to pass her days in a sedan-chair.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you ever see her in it, uncle?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mrs. Joe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow could I,\xe2\x80\x9d he returned, forced to the admission, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen I never see\r\nher in my life? Never clapped eyes upon her!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGoodness, uncle! And yet you have spoken to her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, don\xe2\x80\x99t you know,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Pumblechook, testily, \xe2\x80\x9cthat when I have\r\nbeen there, I have been took up to the outside of her door, and the door\r\nhas stood ajar, and she has spoke to me that way. Don\xe2\x80\x99t say you don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nknow that, Mum. Howsever, the boy went there to play. What did you play\r\nat, boy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe played with flags,\xe2\x80\x9d I said. (I beg to observe that I think of myself\r\nwith amazement, when I recall the lies I told on this occasion.)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFlags!\xe2\x80\x9d echoed my sister.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said I. \xe2\x80\x9cEstella waved a blue flag, and I waved a red one, and\r\nMiss Havisham waved one sprinkled all over with little gold stars, out\r\nat the coach-window. And then we all waved our swords and hurrahed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSwords!\xe2\x80\x9d repeated my sister. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere did you get swords from?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOut of a cupboard,\xe2\x80\x9d said I. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I saw pistols in it,--and jam,--and\r\npills. And there was no daylight in the room, but it was all lighted up\r\nwith candles.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s true, Mum,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Pumblechook, with a grave nod. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s the\r\nstate of the case, for that much I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen myself.\xe2\x80\x9d And then they\r\nboth stared at me, and I, with an obtrusive show of artlessness on my\r\ncountenance, stared at them, and plaited the right leg of my trousers\r\nwith my right hand.\r\n\r\nIf they had asked me any more questions, I should undoubtedly have\r\nbetrayed myself, for I was even then on the point of mentioning that\r\nthere was a balloon in the yard, and should have hazarded the statement\r\nbut for my invention being divided between that phenomenon and a bear\r\nin the brewery. They were so much occupied, however, in discussing the\r\nmarvels I had already presented for their consideration, that I escaped.\r\nThe subject still held them when Joe came in from his work to have a cup\r\nof tea. To whom my sister, more for the relief of her own mind than for\r\nthe gratification of his, related my pretended experiences.\r\n\r\nNow, when I saw Joe open his blue eyes and roll them all round the\r\nkitchen in helpless amazement, I was overtaken by penitence; but only as\r\nregarded him,--not in the least as regarded the other two. Towards\r\nJoe, and Joe only, I considered myself a young monster, while they sat\r\ndebating what results would come to me from Miss Havisham\xe2\x80\x99s acquaintance\r\nand favor. They had no doubt that Miss Havisham would \xe2\x80\x9cdo something\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n for me; their doubts related to the form that something would take.\r\nMy sister stood out for \xe2\x80\x9cproperty.\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Pumblechook was in favor of a\r\nhandsome premium for binding me apprentice to some genteel trade,--say,\r\nthe corn and seed trade, for instance. Joe fell into the deepest\r\ndisgrace with both, for offering the bright suggestion that I might only\r\nbe presented with one of the dogs who had fought for the veal-cutlets.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf a fool\xe2\x80\x99s head can\xe2\x80\x99t express better opinions than that,\xe2\x80\x9d said my\r\nsister, \xe2\x80\x9cand you have got any work to do, you had better go and do it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n So he went.\r\n\r\nAfter Mr. Pumblechook had driven off, and when my sister was washing up,\r\nI stole into the forge to Joe, and remained by him until he had done for\r\nthe night. Then I said, \xe2\x80\x9cBefore the fire goes out, Joe, I should like to\r\ntell you something.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShould you, Pip?\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe, drawing his shoeing-stool near the forge.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen tell us. What is it, Pip?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJoe,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, taking hold of his rolled-up shirt sleeve, and twisting\r\nit between my finger and thumb, \xe2\x80\x9cyou remember all that about Miss\r\nHavisham\xe2\x80\x99s?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRemember?\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe. \xe2\x80\x9cI believe you! Wonderful!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a terrible thing, Joe; it ain\xe2\x80\x99t true.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you telling of, Pip?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Joe, falling back in the greatest\r\namazement. \xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t mean to say it\xe2\x80\x99s--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes I do; it\xe2\x80\x99s lies, Joe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut not all of it? Why sure you don\xe2\x80\x99t mean to say, Pip, that there was\r\nno black welwet co--eh?\xe2\x80\x9d For, I stood shaking my head. \xe2\x80\x9cBut at least\r\nthere was dogs, Pip? Come, Pip,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe, persuasively, \xe2\x80\x9cif there\r\nwarn\xe2\x80\x99t no weal-cutlets, at least there was dogs?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Joe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA dog?\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe. \xe2\x80\x9cA puppy? Come?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Joe, there was nothing at all of the kind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs I fixed my eyes hopelessly on Joe, Joe contemplated me in dismay.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPip, old chap! This won\xe2\x80\x99t do, old fellow! I say! Where do you expect to\r\ngo to?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s terrible, Joe; ain\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTerrible?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Joe. \xe2\x80\x9cAwful! What possessed you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know what possessed me, Joe,\xe2\x80\x9d I replied, letting his shirt\r\nsleeve go, and sitting down in the ashes at his feet, hanging my head;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cbut I wish you hadn\xe2\x80\x99t taught me to call Knaves at cards Jacks; and I\r\nwish my boots weren\xe2\x80\x99t so thick nor my hands so coarse.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd then I told Joe that I felt very miserable, and that I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been\r\nable to explain myself to Mrs. Joe and Pumblechook, who were so rude to\r\nme, and that there had been a beautiful young lady at Miss Havisham\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwho was dreadfully proud, and that she had said I was common, and that I\r\nknew I was common, and that I wished I was not common, and that the lies\r\nhad come of it somehow, though I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know how.\r\n\r\nThis was a case of metaphysics, at least as difficult for Joe to deal\r\nwith as for me. But Joe took the case altogether out of the region of\r\nmetaphysics, and by that means vanquished it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s one thing you may be sure of, Pip,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe, after some\r\nrumination, \xe2\x80\x9cnamely, that lies is lies. Howsever they come, they didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nought to come, and they come from the father of lies, and work round to\r\nthe same. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you tell no more of \xe2\x80\x98em, Pip. That ain\xe2\x80\x99t the way to get\r\nout of being common, old chap. And as to being common, I don\xe2\x80\x99t make\r\nit out at all clear. You are oncommon in some things. You\xe2\x80\x99re oncommon\r\nsmall. Likewise you\xe2\x80\x99re a oncommon scholar.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I am ignorant and backward, Joe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, see what a letter you wrote last night! Wrote in print even! I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nseen letters--Ah! and from gentlefolks!--that I\xe2\x80\x99ll swear weren\xe2\x80\x99t wrote\r\nin print,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have learnt next to nothing, Joe. You think much of me. It\xe2\x80\x99s only\r\nthat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Pip,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe, \xe2\x80\x9cbe it so or be it son\xe2\x80\x99t, you must be a common\r\nscholar afore you can be a oncommon one, I should hope! The king upon\r\nhis throne, with his crown upon his ed, can\xe2\x80\x99t sit and write his acts\r\nof Parliament in print, without having begun, when he were a unpromoted\r\nPrince, with the alphabet.--Ah!\xe2\x80\x9d added Joe, with a shake of the head\r\nthat was full of meaning, \xe2\x80\x9cand begun at A too, and worked his way to Z.\r\nAnd I know what that is to do, though I can\xe2\x80\x99t say I\xe2\x80\x99ve exactly done it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was some hope in this piece of wisdom, and it rather encouraged\r\nme.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhether common ones as to callings and earnings,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued Joe,\r\nreflectively, \xe2\x80\x9cmightn\xe2\x80\x99t be the better of continuing for to keep\r\ncompany with common ones, instead of going out to play with oncommon\r\nones,--which reminds me to hope that there were a flag, perhaps?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Joe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c(I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry there weren\xe2\x80\x99t a flag, Pip). Whether that might be or\r\nmightn\xe2\x80\x99t be, is a thing as can\xe2\x80\x99t be looked into now, without putting\r\nyour sister on the Rampage; and that\xe2\x80\x99s a thing not to be thought of as\r\nbeing done intentional. Lookee here, Pip, at what is said to you by a\r\ntrue friend. Which this to you the true friend say. If you can\xe2\x80\x99t get to\r\nbe oncommon through going straight, you\xe2\x80\x99ll never get to do it through\r\ngoing crooked. So don\xe2\x80\x99t tell no more on \xe2\x80\x98em, Pip, and live well and die\r\nhappy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are not angry with me, Joe?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, old chap. But bearing in mind that them were which I meantersay\r\nof a stunning and outdacious sort,--alluding to them which bordered on\r\nweal-cutlets and dog-fighting,--a sincere well-wisher would adwise, Pip,\r\ntheir being dropped into your meditations, when you go upstairs to bed.\r\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s all, old chap, and don\xe2\x80\x99t never do it no more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen I got up to my little room and said my prayers, I did not forget\r\nJoe\xe2\x80\x99s recommendation, and yet my young mind was in that disturbed and\r\nunthankful state, that I thought long after I laid me down, how common\r\nEstella would consider Joe, a mere blacksmith; how thick his boots, and\r\nhow coarse his hands. I thought how Joe and my sister were then sitting\r\nin the kitchen, and how I had come up to bed from the kitchen, and how\r\nMiss Havisham and Estella never sat in a kitchen, but were far above the\r\nlevel of such common doings. I fell asleep recalling what I \xe2\x80\x9cused to\r\ndo\xe2\x80\x9d when I was at Miss Havisham\xe2\x80\x99s; as though I had been there weeks or\r\nmonths, instead of hours; and as though it were quite an old subject of\r\nremembrance, instead of one that had arisen only that day.\r\n\r\nThat was a memorable day to me, for it made great changes in me. But it\r\nis the same with any life. Imagine one selected day struck out of it,\r\nand think how different its course would have been. Pause you who read\r\nthis, and think for a moment of the long chain of iron or gold,\r\nof thorns or flowers, that would never have bound you, but for the\r\nformation of the first link on one memorable day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter X\r\n\r\nThe felicitous idea occurred to me a morning or two later when I woke,\r\nthat the best step I could take towards making myself uncommon was to\r\nget out of Biddy everything she knew. In pursuance of this luminous\r\nconception I mentioned to Biddy when I went to Mr. Wopsle\xe2\x80\x99s great-aunt\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nat night, that I had a particular reason for wishing to get on in life,\r\nand that I should feel very much obliged to her if she would impart\r\nall her learning to me. Biddy, who was the most obliging of girls,\r\nimmediately said she would, and indeed began to carry out her promise\r\nwithin five minutes.\r\n\r\nThe Educational scheme or Course established by Mr. Wopsle\xe2\x80\x99s great-aunt\r\nmay be resolved into the following synopsis. The pupils ate apples\r\nand put straws down one another\xe2\x80\x99s backs, until Mr. Wopsle\xe2\x80\x99s great-aunt\r\ncollected her energies, and made an indiscriminate totter at them with\r\na birch-rod. After receiving the charge with every mark of derision, the\r\npupils formed in line and buzzingly passed a ragged book from hand to\r\nhand. The book had an alphabet in it, some figures and tables, and\r\na little spelling,--that is to say, it had had once. As soon as this\r\nvolume began to circulate, Mr. Wopsle\xe2\x80\x99s great-aunt fell into a state of\r\ncoma, arising either from sleep or a rheumatic paroxysm. The pupils then\r\nentered among themselves upon a competitive examination on the subject\r\nof Boots, with the view of ascertaining who could tread the hardest upon\r\nwhose toes. This mental exercise lasted until Biddy made a rush at\r\nthem and distributed three defaced Bibles (shaped as if they had been\r\nunskilfully cut off the chump end of something), more illegibly printed\r\nat the best than any curiosities of literature I have since met with,\r\nspeckled all over with ironmould, and having various specimens of the\r\ninsect world smashed between their leaves. This part of the Course was\r\nusually lightened by several single combats between Biddy and refractory\r\nstudents. When the fights were over, Biddy gave out the number of a\r\npage, and then we all read aloud what we could,--or what we couldn\xe2\x80\x99t--in\r\na frightful chorus; Biddy leading with a high, shrill, monotonous voice,\r\nand none of us having the least notion of, or reverence for, what we\r\nwere reading about. When this horrible din had lasted a certain time,\r\nit mechanically awoke Mr. Wopsle\xe2\x80\x99s great-aunt, who staggered at a boy\r\nfortuitously, and pulled his ears. This was understood to terminate\r\nthe Course for the evening, and we emerged into the air with shrieks of\r\nintellectual victory. It is fair to remark that there was no prohibition\r\nagainst any pupil\xe2\x80\x99s entertaining himself with a slate or even with the\r\nink (when there was any), but that it was not easy to pursue that branch\r\nof study in the winter season, on account of the little general shop\r\nin which the classes were holden--and which was also Mr. Wopsle\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngreat-aunt\xe2\x80\x99s sitting-room and bedchamber--being but faintly illuminated\r\nthrough the agency of one low-spirited dip-candle and no snuffers.\r\n\r\nIt appeared to me that it would take time to become uncommon, under\r\nthese circumstances: nevertheless, I resolved to try it, and that\r\nvery evening Biddy entered on our special agreement, by imparting some\r\ninformation from her little catalogue of Prices, under the head of moist\r\nsugar, and lending me, to copy at home, a large old English D which she\r\nhad imitated from the heading of some newspaper, and which I supposed,\r\nuntil she told me what it was, to be a design for a buckle.\r\n\r\nOf course there was a public-house in the village, and of course Joe\r\nliked sometimes to smoke his pipe there. I had received strict orders\r\nfrom my sister to call for him at the Three Jolly Bargemen, that\r\nevening, on my way from school, and bring him home at my peril. To the\r\nThree Jolly Bargemen, therefore, I directed my steps.\r\n\r\nThere was a bar at the Jolly Bargemen, with some alarmingly long chalk\r\nscores in it on the wall at the side of the door, which seemed to me to\r\nbe never paid off. They had been there ever since I could remember, and\r\nhad grown more than I had. But there was a quantity of chalk about our\r\ncountry, and perhaps the people neglected no opportunity of turning it\r\nto account.\r\n\r\nIt being Saturday night, I found the landlord looking rather grimly\r\nat these records; but as my business was with Joe and not with him, I\r\nmerely wished him good evening, and passed into the common room at the\r\nend of the passage, where there was a bright large kitchen fire,\r\nand where Joe was smoking his pipe in company with Mr. Wopsle and a\r\nstranger. Joe greeted me as usual with \xe2\x80\x9cHalloa, Pip, old chap!\xe2\x80\x9d and the\r\nmoment he said that, the stranger turned his head and looked at me.\r\n\r\nHe was a secret-looking man whom I had never seen before. His head was\r\nall on one side, and one of his eyes was half shut up, as if he were\r\ntaking aim at something with an invisible gun. He had a pipe in his\r\nmouth, and he took it out, and, after slowly blowing all his smoke away\r\nand looking hard at me all the time, nodded. So, I nodded, and then he\r\nnodded again, and made room on the settle beside him that I might sit\r\ndown there.\r\n\r\nBut as I was used to sit beside Joe whenever I entered that place of\r\nresort, I said \xe2\x80\x9cNo, thank you, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d and fell into the space Joe made\r\nfor me on the opposite settle. The strange man, after glancing at Joe,\r\nand seeing that his attention was otherwise engaged, nodded to me again\r\nwhen I had taken my seat, and then rubbed his leg--in a very odd way, as\r\nit struck me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou was saying,\xe2\x80\x9d said the strange man, turning to Joe, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you was a\r\nblacksmith.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. I said it, you know,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99ll you drink, Mr.--? You didn\xe2\x80\x99t mention your name, by the bye.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJoe mentioned it now, and the strange man called him by it. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99ll you\r\ndrink, Mr. Gargery? At my expense? To top up with?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe, \xe2\x80\x9cto tell you the truth, I ain\xe2\x80\x99t much in the habit of\r\ndrinking at anybody\xe2\x80\x99s expense but my own.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHabit? No,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the stranger, \xe2\x80\x9cbut once and away, and on a\r\nSaturday night too. Come! Put a name to it, Mr. Gargery.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t wish to be stiff company,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe. \xe2\x80\x9cRum.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRum,\xe2\x80\x9d repeated the stranger. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd will the other gentleman originate a\r\nsentiment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRum,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Wopsle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThree Rums!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the stranger, calling to the landlord. \xe2\x80\x9cGlasses\r\nround!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis other gentleman,\xe2\x80\x9d observed Joe, by way of introducing Mr. Wopsle,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cis a gentleman that you would like to hear give it out. Our clerk at\r\nchurch.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAha!\xe2\x80\x9d said the stranger, quickly, and cocking his eye at me. \xe2\x80\x9cThe\r\nlonely church, right out on the marshes, with graves round it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe.\r\n\r\nThe stranger, with a comfortable kind of grunt over his pipe, put\r\nhis legs up on the settle that he had to himself. He wore a flapping\r\nbroad-brimmed traveller\xe2\x80\x99s hat, and under it a handkerchief tied over his\r\nhead in the manner of a cap: so that he showed no hair. As he looked\r\nat the fire, I thought I saw a cunning expression, followed by a\r\nhalf-laugh, come into his face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not acquainted with this country, gentlemen, but it seems a\r\nsolitary country towards the river.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMost marshes is solitary,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo doubt, no doubt. Do you find any gypsies, now, or tramps, or\r\nvagrants of any sort, out there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe; \xe2\x80\x9cnone but a runaway convict now and then. And we don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nfind them, easy. Eh, Mr. Wopsle?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Wopsle, with a majestic remembrance of old discomfiture, assented;\r\nbut not warmly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSeems you have been out after such?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the stranger.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnce,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Joe. \xe2\x80\x9cNot that we wanted to take them, you understand;\r\nwe went out as lookers on; me, and Mr. Wopsle, and Pip. Didn\xe2\x80\x99t us, Pip?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Joe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe stranger looked at me again,--still cocking his eye, as if he were\r\nexpressly taking aim at me with his invisible gun,--and said, \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nlikely young parcel of bones that. What is it you call him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPip,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cChristened Pip?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, not christened Pip.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSurname Pip?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s a kind of family name what he gave himself when a\r\ninfant, and is called by.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSon of yours?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe, meditatively, not, of course, that it could be in\r\nanywise necessary to consider about it, but because it was the way at\r\nthe Jolly Bargemen to seem to consider deeply about everything that was\r\ndiscussed over pipes,--\xe2\x80\x9cwell--no. No, he ain\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNevvy?\xe2\x80\x9d said the strange man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe, with the same appearance of profound cogitation, \xe2\x80\x9che\r\nis not--no, not to deceive you, he is not--my nevvy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat the Blue Blazes is he?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the stranger. Which appeared to me\r\nto be an inquiry of unnecessary strength.\r\n\r\nMr. Wopsle struck in upon that; as one who knew all about relationships,\r\nhaving professional occasion to bear in mind what female relations a man\r\nmight not marry; and expounded the ties between me and Joe. Having\r\nhis hand in, Mr. Wopsle finished off with a most terrifically snarling\r\npassage from Richard the Third, and seemed to think he had done quite\r\nenough to account for it when he added, \xe2\x80\x9c--as the poet says.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd here I may remark that when Mr. Wopsle referred to me, he considered\r\nit a necessary part of such reference to rumple my hair and poke it into\r\nmy eyes. I cannot conceive why everybody of his standing who visited\r\nat our house should always have put me through the same inflammatory\r\nprocess under similar circumstances. Yet I do not call to mind that I\r\nwas ever in my earlier youth the subject of remark in our social family\r\ncircle, but some large-handed person took some such ophthalmic steps to\r\npatronize me.\r\n\r\nAll this while, the strange man looked at nobody but me, and looked at\r\nme as if he were determined to have a shot at me at last, and bring me\r\ndown. But he said nothing after offering his Blue Blazes observation,\r\nuntil the glasses of rum and water were brought; and then he made his\r\nshot, and a most extraordinary shot it was.\r\n\r\nIt was not a verbal remark, but a proceeding in dumb-show, and was\r\npointedly addressed to me. He stirred his rum and water pointedly at me,\r\nand he tasted his rum and water pointedly at me. And he stirred it and\r\nhe tasted it; not with a spoon that was brought to him, but with a file.\r\n\r\nHe did this so that nobody but I saw the file; and when he had done it\r\nhe wiped the file and put it in a breast-pocket. I knew it to be\r\nJoe\xe2\x80\x99s file, and I knew that he knew my convict, the moment I saw the\r\ninstrument. I sat gazing at him, spell-bound. But he now reclined on his\r\nsettle, taking very little notice of me, and talking principally about\r\nturnips.\r\n\r\nThere was a delicious sense of cleaning-up and making a quiet pause\r\nbefore going on in life afresh, in our village on Saturday nights, which\r\nstimulated Joe to dare to stay out half an hour longer on Saturdays\r\nthan at other times. The half-hour and the rum and water running out\r\ntogether, Joe got up to go, and took me by the hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStop half a moment, Mr. Gargery,\xe2\x80\x9d said the strange man. \xe2\x80\x9cI think I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\ngot a bright new shilling somewhere in my pocket, and if I have, the boy\r\nshall have it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe looked it out from a handful of small change, folded it in some\r\ncrumpled paper, and gave it to me. \xe2\x80\x9cYours!\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cMind! Your own.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI thanked him, staring at him far beyond the bounds of good manners,\r\nand holding tight to Joe. He gave Joe good-night, and he gave Mr. Wopsle\r\ngood-night (who went out with us), and he gave me only a look with his\r\naiming eye,--no, not a look, for he shut it up, but wonders may be done\r\nwith an eye by hiding it.\r\n\r\nOn the way home, if I had been in a humor for talking, the talk must\r\nhave been all on my side, for Mr. Wopsle parted from us at the door of\r\nthe Jolly Bargemen, and Joe went all the way home with his mouth wide\r\nopen, to rinse the rum out with as much air as possible. But I was in\r\na manner stupefied by this turning up of my old misdeed and old\r\nacquaintance, and could think of nothing else.\r\n\r\nMy sister was not in a very bad temper when we presented ourselves in\r\nthe kitchen, and Joe was encouraged by that unusual circumstance to tell\r\nher about the bright shilling. \xe2\x80\x9cA bad un, I\xe2\x80\x99ll be bound,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Joe\r\ntriumphantly, \xe2\x80\x9cor he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have given it to the boy! Let\xe2\x80\x99s look at\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI took it out of the paper, and it proved to be a good one. \xe2\x80\x9cBut what\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nthis?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Joe, throwing down the shilling and catching up the\r\npaper. \xe2\x80\x9cTwo One-Pound notes?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNothing less than two fat sweltering one-pound notes that seemed to have\r\nbeen on terms of the warmest intimacy with all the cattle-markets in\r\nthe county. Joe caught up his hat again, and ran with them to the Jolly\r\nBargemen to restore them to their owner. While he was gone, I sat down\r\non my usual stool and looked vacantly at my sister, feeling pretty sure\r\nthat the man would not be there.\r\n\r\nPresently, Joe came back, saying that the man was gone, but that he,\r\nJoe, had left word at the Three Jolly Bargemen concerning the notes.\r\nThen my sister sealed them up in a piece of paper, and put them under\r\nsome dried rose-leaves in an ornamental teapot on the top of a press in\r\nthe state parlor. There they remained, a nightmare to me, many and many\r\na night and day.\r\n\r\nI had sadly broken sleep when I got to bed, through thinking of the\r\nstrange man taking aim at me with his invisible gun, and of the guiltily\r\ncoarse and common thing it was, to be on secret terms of conspiracy with\r\nconvicts,--a feature in my low career that I had previously forgotten.\r\nI was haunted by the file too. A dread possessed me that when I least\r\nexpected it, the file would reappear. I coaxed myself to sleep by\r\nthinking of Miss Havisham\xe2\x80\x99s, next Wednesday; and in my sleep I saw\r\nthe file coming at me out of a door, without seeing who held it, and I\r\nscreamed myself awake.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XI\r\n\r\nAt the appointed time I returned to Miss Havisham\xe2\x80\x99s, and my hesitating\r\nring at the gate brought out Estella. She locked it after admitting\r\nme, as she had done before, and again preceded me into the dark passage\r\nwhere her candle stood. She took no notice of me until she had the\r\ncandle in her hand, when she looked over her shoulder, superciliously\r\nsaying, \xe2\x80\x9cYou are to come this way to-day,\xe2\x80\x9d and took me to quite another\r\npart of the house.\r\n\r\nThe passage was a long one, and seemed to pervade the whole square\r\nbasement of the Manor House. We traversed but one side of the square,\r\nhowever, and at the end of it she stopped, and put her candle down and\r\nopened a door. Here, the daylight reappeared, and I found myself in\r\na small paved courtyard, the opposite side of which was formed by a\r\ndetached dwelling-house, that looked as if it had once belonged to the\r\nmanager or head clerk of the extinct brewery. There was a clock in the\r\nouter wall of this house. Like the clock in Miss Havisham\xe2\x80\x99s room, and\r\nlike Miss Havisham\xe2\x80\x99s watch, it had stopped at twenty minutes to nine.\r\n\r\nWe went in at the door, which stood open, and into a gloomy room with a\r\nlow ceiling, on the ground-floor at the back. There was some company in\r\nthe room, and Estella said to me as she joined it, \xe2\x80\x9cYou are to go and\r\nstand there boy, till you are wanted.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x9d, being the window, I\r\ncrossed to it, and stood \xe2\x80\x9cthere,\xe2\x80\x9d in a very uncomfortable state of mind,\r\nlooking out.\r\n\r\nIt opened to the ground, and looked into a most miserable corner of the\r\nneglected garden, upon a rank ruin of cabbage-stalks, and one box-tree\r\nthat had been clipped round long ago, like a pudding, and had a new\r\ngrowth at the top of it, out of shape and of a different color, as if\r\nthat part of the pudding had stuck to the saucepan and got burnt. This\r\nwas my homely thought, as I contemplated the box-tree. There had been\r\nsome light snow, overnight, and it lay nowhere else to my knowledge;\r\nbut, it had not quite melted from the cold shadow of this bit of garden,\r\nand the wind caught it up in little eddies and threw it at the window,\r\nas if it pelted me for coming there.\r\n\r\nI divined that my coming had stopped conversation in the room, and that\r\nits other occupants were looking at me. I could see nothing of the room\r\nexcept the shining of the fire in the window-glass, but I stiffened in\r\nall my joints with the consciousness that I was under close inspection.\r\n\r\nThere were three ladies in the room and one gentleman. Before I had been\r\nstanding at the window five minutes, they somehow conveyed to me that\r\nthey were all toadies and humbugs, but that each of them pretended not\r\nto know that the others were toadies and humbugs: because the admission\r\nthat he or she did know it, would have made him or her out to be a toady\r\nand humbug.\r\n\r\nThey all had a listless and dreary air of waiting somebody\xe2\x80\x99s pleasure,\r\nand the most talkative of the ladies had to speak quite rigidly to\r\nrepress a yawn. This lady, whose name was Camilla, very much reminded\r\nme of my sister, with the difference that she was older, and (as I found\r\nwhen I caught sight of her) of a blunter cast of features. Indeed, when\r\nI knew her better I began to think it was a Mercy she had any features\r\nat all, so very blank and high was the dead wall of her face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor dear soul!\xe2\x80\x9d said this lady, with an abruptness of manner quite my\r\nsister\xe2\x80\x99s. \xe2\x80\x9cNobody\xe2\x80\x99s enemy but his own!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt would be much more commendable to be somebody else\xe2\x80\x99s enemy,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nthe gentleman; \xe2\x80\x9cfar more natural.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCousin Raymond,\xe2\x80\x9d observed another lady, \xe2\x80\x9cwe are to love our neighbor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSarah Pocket,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Cousin Raymond, \xe2\x80\x9cif a man is not his own\r\nneighbor, who is?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Pocket laughed, and Camilla laughed and said (checking a yawn),\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe idea!\xe2\x80\x9d But I thought they seemed to think it rather a good\r\nidea too. The other lady, who had not spoken yet, said gravely and\r\nemphatically, \xe2\x80\x9cVery true!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor soul!\xe2\x80\x9d Camilla presently went on (I knew they had all been looking\r\nat me in the mean time), \xe2\x80\x9che is so very strange! Would anyone believe\r\nthat when Tom\xe2\x80\x99s wife died, he actually could not be induced to see the\r\nimportance of the children\xe2\x80\x99s having the deepest of trimmings to their\r\nmourning? \xe2\x80\x98Good Lord!\xe2\x80\x99 says he, \xe2\x80\x98Camilla, what can it signify so long\r\nas the poor bereaved little things are in black?\xe2\x80\x99 So like Matthew! The\r\nidea!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood points in him, good points in him,\xe2\x80\x9d said Cousin Raymond; \xe2\x80\x9cHeaven\r\nforbid I should deny good points in him; but he never had, and he never\r\nwill have, any sense of the proprieties.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know I was obliged,\xe2\x80\x9d said Camilla,--\xe2\x80\x9cI was obliged to be firm. I\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x98It WILL NOT DO, for the credit of the family.\xe2\x80\x99 I told him that,\r\nwithout deep trimmings, the family was disgraced. I cried about it from\r\nbreakfast till dinner. I injured my digestion. And at last he flung out\r\nin his violent way, and said, with a D, \xe2\x80\x98Then do as you like.\xe2\x80\x99 Thank\r\nGoodness it will always be a consolation to me to know that I instantly\r\nwent out in a pouring rain and bought the things.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe paid for them, did he not?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Estella.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not the question, my dear child, who paid for them,\xe2\x80\x9d returned\r\nCamilla. \xe2\x80\x9cI bought them. And I shall often think of that with peace,\r\nwhen I wake up in the night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe ringing of a distant bell, combined with the echoing of some cry or\r\ncall along the passage by which I had come, interrupted the conversation\r\nand caused Estella to say to me, \xe2\x80\x9cNow, boy!\xe2\x80\x9d On my turning round, they\r\nall looked at me with the utmost contempt, and, as I went out, I heard\r\nSarah Pocket say, \xe2\x80\x9cWell I am sure! What next!\xe2\x80\x9d and Camilla add, with\r\nindignation, \xe2\x80\x9cWas there ever such a fancy! The i-de-a!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs we were going with our candle along the dark passage, Estella stopped\r\nall of a sudden, and, facing round, said in her taunting manner, with\r\nher face quite close to mine,--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, miss?\xe2\x80\x9d I answered, almost falling over her and checking myself.\r\n\r\nShe stood looking at me, and, of course, I stood looking at her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAm I pretty?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; I think you are very pretty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAm I insulting?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot so much so as you were last time,\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot so much so?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe fired when she asked the last question, and she slapped my face with\r\nsuch force as she had, when I answered it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow?\xe2\x80\x9d said she. \xe2\x80\x9cYou little coarse monster, what do you think of me\r\nnow?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall not tell you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause you are going to tell upstairs. Is that it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cthat\xe2\x80\x99s not it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy don\xe2\x80\x99t you cry again, you little wretch?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause I\xe2\x80\x99ll never cry for you again,\xe2\x80\x9d said I. Which was, I suppose, as\r\nfalse a declaration as ever was made; for I was inwardly crying for her\r\nthen, and I know what I know of the pain she cost me afterwards.\r\n\r\nWe went on our way upstairs after this episode; and, as we were going\r\nup, we met a gentleman groping his way down.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhom have we here?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the gentleman, stopping and looking at me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA boy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Estella.\r\n\r\nHe was a burly man of an exceedingly dark complexion, with an\r\nexceedingly large head, and a corresponding large hand. He took my chin\r\nin his large hand and turned up my face to have a look at me by the\r\nlight of the candle. He was prematurely bald on the top of his head, and\r\nhad bushy black eyebrows that wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t lie down but stood up bristling.\r\nHis eyes were set very deep in his head, and were disagreeably sharp and\r\nsuspicious. He had a large watch-chain, and strong black dots where his\r\nbeard and whiskers would have been if he had let them. He was nothing\r\nto me, and I could have had no foresight then, that he ever would be\r\nanything to me, but it happened that I had this opportunity of observing\r\nhim well.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBoy of the neighborhood? Hey?\xe2\x80\x9d said he.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do you come here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Havisham sent for me, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d I explained.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell! Behave yourself. I have a pretty large experience of boys, and\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99re a bad set of fellows. Now mind!\xe2\x80\x9d said he, biting the side of his\r\ngreat forefinger as he frowned at me, \xe2\x80\x9cyou behave yourself!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith those words, he released me--which I was glad of, for his hand\r\nsmelt of scented soap--and went his way downstairs. I wondered whether\r\nhe could be a doctor; but no, I thought; he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be a doctor, or he\r\nwould have a quieter and more persuasive manner. There was not much time\r\nto consider the subject, for we were soon in Miss Havisham\xe2\x80\x99s room, where\r\nshe and everything else were just as I had left them. Estella left me\r\nstanding near the door, and I stood there until Miss Havisham cast her\r\neyes upon me from the dressing-table.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo!\xe2\x80\x9d she said, without being startled or surprised: \xe2\x80\x9cthe days have worn\r\naway, have they?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am. To-day is--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere, there, there!\xe2\x80\x9d with the impatient movement of her fingers. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t want to know. Are you ready to play?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI was obliged to answer in some confusion, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think I am, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot at cards again?\xe2\x80\x9d she demanded, with a searching look.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am; I could do that, if I was wanted.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSince this house strikes you old and grave, boy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Havisham,\r\nimpatiently, \xe2\x80\x9cand you are unwilling to play, are you willing to work?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI could answer this inquiry with a better heart than I had been able to\r\nfind for the other question, and I said I was quite willing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen go into that opposite room,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, pointing at the door behind\r\nme with her withered hand, \xe2\x80\x9cand wait there till I come.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI crossed the staircase landing, and entered the room she indicated.\r\nFrom that room, too, the daylight was completely excluded, and it had an\r\nairless smell that was oppressive. A fire had been lately kindled in\r\nthe damp old-fashioned grate, and it was more disposed to go out than\r\nto burn up, and the reluctant smoke which hung in the room seemed colder\r\nthan the clearer air,--like our own marsh mist. Certain wintry branches\r\nof candles on the high chimney-piece faintly lighted the chamber; or it\r\nwould be more expressive to say, faintly troubled its darkness. It was\r\nspacious, and I dare say had once been handsome, but every discernible\r\nthing in it was covered with dust and mould, and dropping to pieces. The\r\nmost prominent object was a long table with a tablecloth spread on it,\r\nas if a feast had been in preparation when the house and the clocks all\r\nstopped together. An epergne or centre-piece of some kind was in the\r\nmiddle of this cloth; it was so heavily overhung with cobwebs that its\r\nform was quite undistinguishable; and, as I looked along the yellow\r\nexpanse out of which I remember its seeming to grow, like a black\r\nfungus, I saw speckle-legged spiders with blotchy bodies running home\r\nto it, and running out from it, as if some circumstances of the greatest\r\npublic importance had just transpired in the spider community.\r\n\r\nI heard the mice too, rattling behind the panels, as if the same\r\noccurrence were important to their interests. But the black beetles took\r\nno notice of the agitation, and groped about the hearth in a ponderous\r\nelderly way, as if they were short-sighted and hard of hearing, and not\r\non terms with one another.\r\n\r\nThese crawling things had fascinated my attention, and I was watching\r\nthem from a distance, when Miss Havisham laid a hand upon my shoulder.\r\nIn her other hand she had a crutch-headed stick on which she leaned, and\r\nshe looked like the Witch of the place.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, pointing to the long table with her stick, \xe2\x80\x9cis where I\r\nwill be laid when I am dead. They shall come and look at me here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith some vague misgiving that she might get upon the table then and\r\nthere and die at once, the complete realization of the ghastly waxwork\r\nat the Fair, I shrank under her touch.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you think that is?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked me, again pointing with her\r\nstick; \xe2\x80\x9cthat, where those cobwebs are?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t guess what it is, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a great cake. A bride-cake. Mine!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe looked all round the room in a glaring manner, and then said,\r\nleaning on me while her hand twitched my shoulder, \xe2\x80\x9cCome, come, come!\r\nWalk me, walk me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI made out from this, that the work I had to do, was to walk Miss\r\nHavisham round and round the room. Accordingly, I started at once, and\r\nshe leaned upon my shoulder, and we went away at a pace that might have\r\nbeen an imitation (founded on my first impulse under that roof) of Mr.\r\nPumblechook\xe2\x80\x99s chaise-cart.\r\n\r\nShe was not physically strong, and after a little time said, \xe2\x80\x9cSlower!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n Still, we went at an impatient fitful speed, and as we went, she\r\ntwitched the hand upon my shoulder, and worked her mouth, and led me to\r\nbelieve that we were going fast because her thoughts went fast. After a\r\nwhile she said, \xe2\x80\x9cCall Estella!\xe2\x80\x9d so I went out on the landing and\r\nroared that name as I had done on the previous occasion. When her light\r\nappeared, I returned to Miss Havisham, and we started away again round\r\nand round the room.\r\n\r\nIf only Estella had come to be a spectator of our proceedings, I should\r\nhave felt sufficiently discontented; but as she brought with her the\r\nthree ladies and the gentleman whom I had seen below, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know\r\nwhat to do. In my politeness, I would have stopped; but Miss\r\nHavisham twitched my shoulder, and we posted on,--with a shame-faced\r\nconsciousness on my part that they would think it was all my doing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear Miss Havisham,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Sarah Pocket. \xe2\x80\x9cHow well you look!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Miss Havisham. \xe2\x80\x9cI am yellow skin and bone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCamilla brightened when Miss Pocket met with this rebuff; and she\r\nmurmured, as she plaintively contemplated Miss Havisham, \xe2\x80\x9cPoor dear\r\nsoul! Certainly not to be expected to look well, poor thing. The idea!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd how are you?\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Havisham to Camilla. As we were close to\r\nCamilla then, I would have stopped as a matter of course, only Miss\r\nHavisham wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t stop. We swept on, and I felt that I was highly\r\nobnoxious to Camilla.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you, Miss Havisham,\xe2\x80\x9d she returned, \xe2\x80\x9cI am as well as can be\r\nexpected.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, what\xe2\x80\x99s the matter with you?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Miss Havisham, with exceeding\r\nsharpness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing worth mentioning,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Camilla. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t wish to make a\r\ndisplay of my feelings, but I have habitually thought of you more in the\r\nnight than I am quite equal to.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen don\xe2\x80\x99t think of me,\xe2\x80\x9d retorted Miss Havisham.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery easily said!\xe2\x80\x9d remarked Camilla, amiably repressing a sob, while a\r\nhitch came into her upper lip, and her tears overflowed. \xe2\x80\x9cRaymond is a\r\nwitness what ginger and sal volatile I am obliged to take in the night.\r\nRaymond is a witness what nervous jerkings I have in my legs. Chokings\r\nand nervous jerkings, however, are nothing new to me when I think with\r\nanxiety of those I love. If I could be less affectionate and sensitive,\r\nI should have a better digestion and an iron set of nerves. I am sure\r\nI wish it could be so. But as to not thinking of you in the night--The\r\nidea!\xe2\x80\x9d Here, a burst of tears.\r\n\r\nThe Raymond referred to, I understood to be the gentleman present, and\r\nhim I understood to be Mr. Camilla. He came to the rescue at this point,\r\nand said in a consolatory and complimentary voice, \xe2\x80\x9cCamilla, my dear, it\r\nis well known that your family feelings are gradually undermining you to\r\nthe extent of making one of your legs shorter than the other.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not aware,\xe2\x80\x9d observed the grave lady whose voice I had heard but\r\nonce, \xe2\x80\x9cthat to think of any person is to make a great claim upon that\r\nperson, my dear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Sarah Pocket, whom I now saw to be a little dry, brown, corrugated\r\nold woman, with a small face that might have been made of walnut-shells,\r\nand a large mouth like a cat\xe2\x80\x99s without the whiskers, supported this\r\nposition by saying, \xe2\x80\x9cNo, indeed, my dear. Hem!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThinking is easy enough,\xe2\x80\x9d said the grave lady.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is easier, you know?\xe2\x80\x9d assented Miss Sarah Pocket.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes, yes!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Camilla, whose fermenting feelings appeared to\r\nrise from her legs to her bosom. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s all very true! It\xe2\x80\x99s a weakness\r\nto be so affectionate, but I can\xe2\x80\x99t help it. No doubt my health would be\r\nmuch better if it was otherwise, still I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t change my disposition\r\nif I could. It\xe2\x80\x99s the cause of much suffering, but it\xe2\x80\x99s a consolation to\r\nknow I posses it, when I wake up in the night.\xe2\x80\x9d Here another burst of\r\nfeeling.\r\n\r\nMiss Havisham and I had never stopped all this time, but kept going\r\nround and round the room; now brushing against the skirts of the\r\nvisitors, now giving them the whole length of the dismal chamber.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s Matthew!\xe2\x80\x9d said Camilla. \xe2\x80\x9cNever mixing with any natural ties,\r\nnever coming here to see how Miss Havisham is! I have taken to the sofa\r\nwith my staylace cut, and have lain there hours insensible, with my head\r\nover the side, and my hair all down, and my feet I don\xe2\x80\x99t know where--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n(\xe2\x80\x9cMuch higher than your head, my love,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Camilla.)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have gone off into that state, hours and hours, on account of\r\nMatthew\xe2\x80\x99s strange and inexplicable conduct, and nobody has thanked me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cReally I must say I should think not!\xe2\x80\x9d interposed the grave lady.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou see, my dear,\xe2\x80\x9d added Miss Sarah Pocket (a blandly vicious\r\npersonage), \xe2\x80\x9cthe question to put to yourself is, who did you expect to\r\nthank you, my love?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWithout expecting any thanks, or anything of the sort,\xe2\x80\x9d resumed\r\nCamilla, \xe2\x80\x9cI have remained in that state, hours and hours, and Raymond\r\nis a witness of the extent to which I have choked, and what the total\r\ninefficacy of ginger has been, and I have been heard at the piano-forte\r\ntuner\xe2\x80\x99s across the street, where the poor mistaken children have even\r\nsupposed it to be pigeons cooing at a distance,--and now to be told--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n Here Camilla put her hand to her throat, and began to be quite chemical\r\nas to the formation of new combinations there.\r\n\r\nWhen this same Matthew was mentioned, Miss Havisham stopped me and\r\nherself, and stood looking at the speaker. This change had a great\r\ninfluence in bringing Camilla\xe2\x80\x99s chemistry to a sudden end.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMatthew will come and see me at last,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Havisham, sternly,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwhen I am laid on that table. That will be his place,--there,\xe2\x80\x9d striking\r\nthe table with her stick, \xe2\x80\x9cat my head! And yours will be there! And your\r\nhusband\xe2\x80\x99s there! And Sarah Pocket\xe2\x80\x99s there! And Georgiana\xe2\x80\x99s there! Now\r\nyou all know where to take your stations when you come to feast upon me.\r\nAnd now go!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt the mention of each name, she had struck the table with her stick in\r\na new place. She now said, \xe2\x80\x9cWalk me, walk me!\xe2\x80\x9d and we went on again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing to be done,\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Camilla, \xe2\x80\x9cbut comply\r\nand depart. It\xe2\x80\x99s something to have seen the object of one\xe2\x80\x99s love and\r\nduty for even so short a time. I shall think of it with a melancholy\r\nsatisfaction when I wake up in the night. I wish Matthew could have\r\nthat comfort, but he sets it at defiance. I am determined not to make a\r\ndisplay of my feelings, but it\xe2\x80\x99s very hard to be told one wants to feast\r\non one\xe2\x80\x99s relations,--as if one was a Giant,--and to be told to go. The\r\nbare idea!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Camilla interposing, as Mrs. Camilla laid her hand upon her heaving\r\nbosom, that lady assumed an unnatural fortitude of manner which I\r\nsupposed to be expressive of an intention to drop and choke when out of\r\nview, and kissing her hand to Miss Havisham, was escorted forth. Sarah\r\nPocket and Georgiana contended who should remain last; but Sarah was\r\ntoo knowing to be outdone, and ambled round Georgiana with that artful\r\nslipperiness that the latter was obliged to take precedence. Sarah\r\nPocket then made her separate effect of departing with, \xe2\x80\x9cBless you, Miss\r\nHavisham dear!\xe2\x80\x9d and with a smile of forgiving pity on her walnut-shell\r\ncountenance for the weaknesses of the rest.\r\n\r\nWhile Estella was away lighting them down, Miss Havisham still walked\r\nwith her hand on my shoulder, but more and more slowly. At last she\r\nstopped before the fire, and said, after muttering and looking at it\r\nsome seconds,--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is my birthday, Pip.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI was going to wish her many happy returns, when she lifted her stick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t suffer it to be spoken of. I don\xe2\x80\x99t suffer those who were here\r\njust now, or any one to speak of it. They come here on the day, but they\r\ndare not refer to it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOf course I made no further effort to refer to it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn this day of the year, long before you were born, this heap of\r\ndecay,\xe2\x80\x9d stabbing with her crutched stick at the pile of cobwebs on the\r\ntable, but not touching it, \xe2\x80\x9cwas brought here. It and I have worn away\r\ntogether. The mice have gnawed at it, and sharper teeth than teeth of\r\nmice have gnawed at me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe held the head of her stick against her heart as she stood looking\r\nat the table; she in her once white dress, all yellow and withered; the\r\nonce white cloth all yellow and withered; everything around in a state\r\nto crumble under a touch.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen the ruin is complete,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, with a ghastly look, \xe2\x80\x9cand when\r\nthey lay me dead, in my bride\xe2\x80\x99s dress on the bride\xe2\x80\x99s table,--which shall\r\nbe done, and which will be the finished curse upon him,--so much the\r\nbetter if it is done on this day!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe stood looking at the table as if she stood looking at her own figure\r\nlying there. I remained quiet. Estella returned, and she too remained\r\nquiet. It seemed to me that we continued thus for a long time. In\r\nthe heavy air of the room, and the heavy darkness that brooded in its\r\nremoter corners, I even had an alarming fancy that Estella and I might\r\npresently begin to decay.\r\n\r\nAt length, not coming out of her distraught state by degrees, but in an\r\ninstant, Miss Havisham said, \xe2\x80\x9cLet me see you two play cards; why have\r\nyou not begun?\xe2\x80\x9d With that, we returned to her room, and sat down as\r\nbefore; I was beggared, as before; and again, as before, Miss Havisham\r\nwatched us all the time, directed my attention to Estella\xe2\x80\x99s beauty, and\r\nmade me notice it the more by trying her jewels on Estella\xe2\x80\x99s breast and\r\nhair.\r\n\r\nEstella, for her part, likewise treated me as before, except that she\r\ndid not condescend to speak. When we had played some half-dozen games,\r\na day was appointed for my return, and I was taken down into the yard\r\nto be fed in the former dog-like manner. There, too, I was again left to\r\nwander about as I liked.\r\n\r\nIt is not much to the purpose whether a gate in that garden wall which\r\nI had scrambled up to peep over on the last occasion was, on that last\r\noccasion, open or shut. Enough that I saw no gate then, and that I\r\nsaw one now. As it stood open, and as I knew that Estella had let\r\nthe visitors out,--for she had returned with the keys in her hand,--I\r\nstrolled into the garden, and strolled all over it. It was quite a\r\nwilderness, and there were old melon-frames and cucumber-frames in it,\r\nwhich seemed in their decline to have produced a spontaneous growth of\r\nweak attempts at pieces of old hats and boots, with now and then a weedy\r\noffshoot into the likeness of a battered saucepan.\r\n\r\nWhen I had exhausted the garden and a greenhouse with nothing in it but\r\na fallen-down grape-vine and some bottles, I found myself in the dismal\r\ncorner upon which I had looked out of the window. Never questioning for\r\na moment that the house was now empty, I looked in at another window,\r\nand found myself, to my great surprise, exchanging a broad stare with a\r\npale young gentleman with red eyelids and light hair.\r\n\r\nThis pale young gentleman quickly disappeared, and reappeared beside me.\r\nHe had been at his books when I had found myself staring at him, and I\r\nnow saw that he was inky.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHalloa!\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cyoung fellow!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHalloa being a general observation which I had usually observed to\r\nbe best answered by itself, I said, \xe2\x80\x9cHalloa!\xe2\x80\x9d politely omitting young\r\nfellow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho let you in?\xe2\x80\x9d said he.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Estella.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho gave you leave to prowl about?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Estella.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome and fight,\xe2\x80\x9d said the pale young gentleman.\r\n\r\nWhat could I do but follow him? I have often asked myself the question\r\nsince; but what else could I do? His manner was so final, and I was\r\nso astonished, that I followed where he led, as if I had been under a\r\nspell.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStop a minute, though,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, wheeling round before we had gone many\r\npaces. \xe2\x80\x9cI ought to give you a reason for fighting, too. There it is!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n In a most irritating manner he instantly slapped his hands against one\r\nanother, daintily flung one of his legs up behind him, pulled my hair,\r\nslapped his hands again, dipped his head, and butted it into my stomach.\r\n\r\nThe bull-like proceeding last mentioned, besides that it was\r\nunquestionably to be regarded in the light of a liberty, was\r\nparticularly disagreeable just after bread and meat. I therefore hit out\r\nat him and was going to hit out again, when he said, \xe2\x80\x9cAha! Would you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n and began dancing backwards and forwards in a manner quite unparalleled\r\nwithin my limited experience.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLaws of the game!\xe2\x80\x9d said he. Here, he skipped from his left leg on to\r\nhis right. \xe2\x80\x9cRegular rules!\xe2\x80\x9d Here, he skipped from his right leg on to\r\nhis left. \xe2\x80\x9cCome to the ground, and go through the preliminaries!\xe2\x80\x9d Here,\r\nhe dodged backwards and forwards, and did all sorts of things while I\r\nlooked helplessly at him.\r\n\r\nI was secretly afraid of him when I saw him so dexterous; but I felt\r\nmorally and physically convinced that his light head of hair could have\r\nhad no business in the pit of my stomach, and that I had a right to\r\nconsider it irrelevant when so obtruded on my attention. Therefore, I\r\nfollowed him without a word, to a retired nook of the garden, formed by\r\nthe junction of two walls and screened by some rubbish. On his asking me\r\nif I was satisfied with the ground, and on my replying Yes, he begged my\r\nleave to absent himself for a moment, and quickly returned with a bottle\r\nof water and a sponge dipped in vinegar. \xe2\x80\x9cAvailable for both,\xe2\x80\x9d he said,\r\nplacing these against the wall. And then fell to pulling off, not\r\nonly his jacket and waistcoat, but his shirt too, in a manner at once\r\nlight-hearted, business-like, and bloodthirsty.\r\n\r\nAlthough he did not look very healthy,--having pimples on his face, and\r\na breaking out at his mouth,--these dreadful preparations quite appalled\r\nme. I judged him to be about my own age, but he was much taller, and he\r\nhad a way of spinning himself about that was full of appearance. For\r\nthe rest, he was a young gentleman in a gray suit (when not denuded\r\nfor battle), with his elbows, knees, wrists, and heels considerably in\r\nadvance of the rest of him as to development.\r\n\r\nMy heart failed me when I saw him squaring at me with every\r\ndemonstration of mechanical nicety, and eyeing my anatomy as if he were\r\nminutely choosing his bone. I never have been so surprised in my life,\r\nas I was when I let out the first blow, and saw him lying on his\r\nback, looking up at me with a bloody nose and his face exceedingly\r\nfore-shortened.\r\n\r\nBut, he was on his feet directly, and after sponging himself with\r\na great show of dexterity began squaring again. The second greatest\r\nsurprise I have ever had in my life was seeing him on his back again,\r\nlooking up at me out of a black eye.\r\n\r\nHis spirit inspired me with great respect. He seemed to have no\r\nstrength, and he never once hit me hard, and he was always knocked down;\r\nbut he would be up again in a moment, sponging himself or drinking out\r\nof the water-bottle, with the greatest satisfaction in seconding himself\r\naccording to form, and then came at me with an air and a show that made\r\nme believe he really was going to do for me at last. He got heavily\r\nbruised, for I am sorry to record that the more I hit him, the harder I\r\nhit him; but he came up again and again and again, until at last he got\r\na bad fall with the back of his head against the wall. Even after that\r\ncrisis in our affairs, he got up and turned round and round confusedly a\r\nfew times, not knowing where I was; but finally went on his knees to his\r\nsponge and threw it up: at the same time panting out, \xe2\x80\x9cThat means you\r\nhave won.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe seemed so brave and innocent, that although I had not proposed the\r\ncontest, I felt but a gloomy satisfaction in my victory. Indeed, I go\r\nso far as to hope that I regarded myself while dressing as a species of\r\nsavage young wolf or other wild beast. However, I got dressed, darkly\r\nwiping my sanguinary face at intervals, and I said, \xe2\x80\x9cCan I help you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n and he said \xe2\x80\x9cNo thankee,\xe2\x80\x9d and I said \xe2\x80\x9cGood afternoon,\xe2\x80\x9d and he said \xe2\x80\x9cSame\r\nto you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen I got into the courtyard, I found Estella waiting with the keys.\r\nBut she neither asked me where I had been, nor why I had kept her\r\nwaiting; and there was a bright flush upon her face, as though something\r\nhad happened to delight her. Instead of going straight to the gate, too,\r\nshe stepped back into the passage, and beckoned me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome here! You may kiss me, if you like.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI kissed her cheek as she turned it to me. I think I would have gone\r\nthrough a great deal to kiss her cheek. But I felt that the kiss was\r\ngiven to the coarse common boy as a piece of money might have been, and\r\nthat it was worth nothing.\r\n\r\nWhat with the birthday visitors, and what with the cards, and what with\r\nthe fight, my stay had lasted so long, that when I neared home the light\r\non the spit of sand off the point on the marshes was gleaming against\r\na black night-sky, and Joe\xe2\x80\x99s furnace was flinging a path of fire across\r\nthe road.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XII\r\n\r\nMy mind grew very uneasy on the subject of the pale young gentleman. The\r\nmore I thought of the fight, and recalled the pale young gentleman on\r\nhis back in various stages of puffy and incrimsoned countenance, the\r\nmore certain it appeared that something would be done to me. I felt that\r\nthe pale young gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s blood was on my head, and that the Law would\r\navenge it. Without having any definite idea of the penalties I had\r\nincurred, it was clear to me that village boys could not go stalking\r\nabout the country, ravaging the houses of gentlefolks and pitching into\r\nthe studious youth of England, without laying themselves open to severe\r\npunishment. For some days, I even kept close at home, and looked out at\r\nthe kitchen door with the greatest caution and trepidation before going\r\non an errand, lest the officers of the County Jail should pounce upon\r\nme. The pale young gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s nose had stained my trousers, and I tried\r\nto wash out that evidence of my guilt in the dead of night. I had cut\r\nmy knuckles against the pale young gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s teeth, and I twisted my\r\nimagination into a thousand tangles, as I devised incredible ways of\r\naccounting for that damnatory circumstance when I should be haled before\r\nthe Judges.\r\n\r\nWhen the day came round for my return to the scene of the deed of\r\nviolence, my terrors reached their height. Whether myrmidons of Justice,\r\nspecially sent down from London, would be lying in ambush behind the\r\ngate;--whether Miss Havisham, preferring to take personal vengeance for\r\nan outrage done to her house, might rise in those grave-clothes of hers,\r\ndraw a pistol, and shoot me dead:--whether suborned boys--a numerous\r\nband of mercenaries--might be engaged to fall upon me in the brewery,\r\nand cuff me until I was no more;--it was high testimony to my confidence\r\nin the spirit of the pale young gentleman, that I never imagined him\r\naccessory to these retaliations; they always came into my mind as the\r\nacts of injudicious relatives of his, goaded on by the state of his\r\nvisage and an indignant sympathy with the family features.\r\n\r\nHowever, go to Miss Havisham\xe2\x80\x99s I must, and go I did. And behold! nothing\r\ncame of the late struggle. It was not alluded to in any way, and no pale\r\nyoung gentleman was to be discovered on the premises. I found the same\r\ngate open, and I explored the garden, and even looked in at the windows\r\nof the detached house; but my view was suddenly stopped by the closed\r\nshutters within, and all was lifeless. Only in the corner where\r\nthe combat had taken place could I detect any evidence of the young\r\ngentleman\xe2\x80\x99s existence. There were traces of his gore in that spot, and I\r\ncovered them with garden-mould from the eye of man.\r\n\r\nOn the broad landing between Miss Havisham\xe2\x80\x99s own room and that other\r\nroom in which the long table was laid out, I saw a garden-chair,--a\r\nlight chair on wheels, that you pushed from behind. It had been placed\r\nthere since my last visit, and I entered, that same day, on a regular\r\noccupation of pushing Miss Havisham in this chair (when she was tired of\r\nwalking with her hand upon my shoulder) round her own room, and across\r\nthe landing, and round the other room. Over and over and over again,\r\nwe would make these journeys, and sometimes they would last as long as\r\nthree hours at a stretch. I insensibly fall into a general mention of\r\nthese journeys as numerous, because it was at once settled that I should\r\nreturn every alternate day at noon for these purposes, and because I am\r\nnow going to sum up a period of at least eight or ten months.\r\n\r\nAs we began to be more used to one another, Miss Havisham talked more\r\nto me, and asked me such questions as what had I learnt and what was\r\nI going to be? I told her I was going to be apprenticed to Joe, I\r\nbelieved; and I enlarged upon my knowing nothing and wanting to know\r\neverything, in the hope that she might offer some help towards that\r\ndesirable end. But she did not; on the contrary, she seemed to prefer my\r\nbeing ignorant. Neither did she ever give me any money,--or anything\r\nbut my daily dinner,--nor ever stipulate that I should be paid for my\r\nservices.\r\n\r\nEstella was always about, and always let me in and out, but never told\r\nme I might kiss her again. Sometimes, she would coldly tolerate me;\r\nsometimes, she would condescend to me; sometimes, she would be quite\r\nfamiliar with me; sometimes, she would tell me energetically that she\r\nhated me. Miss Havisham would often ask me in a whisper, or when we were\r\nalone, \xe2\x80\x9cDoes she grow prettier and prettier, Pip?\xe2\x80\x9d And when I said yes\r\n(for indeed she did), would seem to enjoy it greedily. Also, when we\r\nplayed at cards Miss Havisham would look on, with a miserly relish of\r\nEstella\xe2\x80\x99s moods, whatever they were. And sometimes, when her moods were\r\nso many and so contradictory of one another that I was puzzled what\r\nto say or do, Miss Havisham would embrace her with lavish fondness,\r\nmurmuring something in her ear that sounded like \xe2\x80\x9cBreak their hearts my\r\npride and hope, break their hearts and have no mercy!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a song Joe used to hum fragments of at the forge, of which the\r\nburden was Old Clem. This was not a very ceremonious way of rendering\r\nhomage to a patron saint, but I believe Old Clem stood in that relation\r\ntowards smiths. It was a song that imitated the measure of beating upon\r\niron, and was a mere lyrical excuse for the introduction of Old Clem\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nrespected name. Thus, you were to hammer boys round--Old Clem! With a\r\nthump and a sound--Old Clem! Beat it out, beat it out--Old Clem! With a\r\nclink for the stout--Old Clem! Blow the fire, blow the fire--Old\r\nClem! Roaring dryer, soaring higher--Old Clem! One day soon after the\r\nappearance of the chair, Miss Havisham suddenly saying to me, with the\r\nimpatient movement of her fingers, \xe2\x80\x9cThere, there, there! Sing!\xe2\x80\x9d I was\r\nsurprised into crooning this ditty as I pushed her over the floor. It\r\nhappened so to catch her fancy that she took it up in a low brooding\r\nvoice as if she were singing in her sleep. After that, it became\r\ncustomary with us to have it as we moved about, and Estella would often\r\njoin in; though the whole strain was so subdued, even when there were\r\nthree of us, that it made less noise in the grim old house than the\r\nlightest breath of wind.\r\n\r\nWhat could I become with these surroundings? How could my character fail\r\nto be influenced by them? Is it to be wondered at if my thoughts were\r\ndazed, as my eyes were, when I came out into the natural light from the\r\nmisty yellow rooms?\r\n\r\nPerhaps I might have told Joe about the pale young gentleman, if I had\r\nnot previously been betrayed into those enormous inventions to which\r\nI had confessed. Under the circumstances, I felt that Joe could hardly\r\nfail to discern in the pale young gentleman, an appropriate passenger\r\nto be put into the black velvet coach; therefore, I said nothing of him.\r\nBesides, that shrinking from having Miss Havisham and Estella discussed,\r\nwhich had come upon me in the beginning, grew much more potent as time\r\nwent on. I reposed complete confidence in no one but Biddy; but I told\r\npoor Biddy everything. Why it came natural to me to do so, and why Biddy\r\nhad a deep concern in everything I told her, I did not know then, though\r\nI think I know now.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, councils went on in the kitchen at home, fraught with\r\nalmost insupportable aggravation to my exasperated spirit. That ass,\r\nPumblechook, used often to come over of a night for the purpose of\r\ndiscussing my prospects with my sister; and I really do believe (to\r\nthis hour with less penitence than I ought to feel), that if these hands\r\ncould have taken a linchpin out of his chaise-cart, they would have done\r\nit. The miserable man was a man of that confined stolidity of mind, that\r\nhe could not discuss my prospects without having me before him,--as it\r\nwere, to operate upon,--and he would drag me up from my stool (usually\r\nby the collar) where I was quiet in a corner, and, putting me before the\r\nfire as if I were going to be cooked, would begin by saying, \xe2\x80\x9cNow, Mum,\r\nhere is this boy! Here is this boy which you brought up by hand. Hold up\r\nyour head, boy, and be forever grateful unto them which so did do. Now,\r\nMum, with respections to this boy!\xe2\x80\x9d And then he would rumple my hair\r\nthe wrong way,--which from my earliest remembrance, as already hinted,\r\nI have in my soul denied the right of any fellow-creature to do,--and\r\nwould hold me before him by the sleeve,--a spectacle of imbecility only\r\nto be equalled by himself.\r\n\r\nThen, he and my sister would pair off in such nonsensical speculations\r\nabout Miss Havisham, and about what she would do with me and for me,\r\nthat I used to want--quite painfully--to burst into spiteful tears, fly\r\nat Pumblechook, and pummel him all over. In these dialogues, my sister\r\nspoke to me as if she were morally wrenching one of my teeth out at\r\nevery reference; while Pumblechook himself, self-constituted my patron,\r\nwould sit supervising me with a depreciatory eye, like the architect of\r\nmy fortunes who thought himself engaged on a very unremunerative job.\r\n\r\nIn these discussions, Joe bore no part. But he was often talked at,\r\nwhile they were in progress, by reason of Mrs. Joe\xe2\x80\x99s perceiving that\r\nhe was not favorable to my being taken from the forge. I was fully old\r\nenough now to be apprenticed to Joe; and when Joe sat with the poker on\r\nhis knees thoughtfully raking out the ashes between the lower bars, my\r\nsister would so distinctly construe that innocent action into opposition\r\non his part, that she would dive at him, take the poker out of his\r\nhands, shake him, and put it away. There was a most irritating end to\r\nevery one of these debates. All in a moment, with nothing to lead up to\r\nit, my sister would stop herself in a yawn, and catching sight of me as\r\nit were incidentally, would swoop upon me with, \xe2\x80\x9cCome! there\xe2\x80\x99s enough of\r\nyou! You get along to bed; you\xe2\x80\x99ve given trouble enough for one night, I\r\nhope!\xe2\x80\x9d As if I had besought them as a favor to bother my life out.\r\n\r\nWe went on in this way for a long time, and it seemed likely that we\r\nshould continue to go on in this way for a long time, when one day Miss\r\nHavisham stopped short as she and I were walking, she leaning on my\r\nshoulder; and said with some displeasure,--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are growing tall, Pip!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI thought it best to hint, through the medium of a meditative look, that\r\nthis might be occasioned by circumstances over which I had no control.\r\n\r\nShe said no more at the time; but she presently stopped and looked at me\r\nagain; and presently again; and after that, looked frowning and moody.\r\nOn the next day of my attendance, when our usual exercise was over, and\r\nI had landed her at her dressing-table, she stayed me with a movement of\r\nher impatient fingers:--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell me the name again of that blacksmith of yours.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJoe Gargery, ma\xe2\x80\x99am.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMeaning the master you were to be apprenticed to?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Miss Havisham.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou had better be apprenticed at once. Would Gargery come here with\r\nyou, and bring your indentures, do you think?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI signified that I had no doubt he would take it as an honor to be\r\nasked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen let him come.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt any particular time, Miss Havisham?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere, there! I know nothing about times. Let him come soon, and come\r\nalong with you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen I got home at night, and delivered this message for Joe, my sister\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwent on the Rampage,\xe2\x80\x9d in a more alarming degree than at any previous\r\nperiod. She asked me and Joe whether we supposed she was door-mats under\r\nour feet, and how we dared to use her so, and what company we graciously\r\nthought she was fit for? When she had exhausted a torrent of such\r\ninquiries, she threw a candlestick at Joe, burst into a loud sobbing,\r\ngot out the dustpan,--which was always a very bad sign,--put on her\r\ncoarse apron, and began cleaning up to a terrible extent. Not satisfied\r\nwith a dry cleaning, she took to a pail and scrubbing-brush, and cleaned\r\nus out of house and home, so that we stood shivering in the back-yard.\r\nIt was ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock at night before we ventured to creep in again, and\r\nthen she asked Joe why he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t married a Negress Slave at once?\r\nJoe offered no answer, poor fellow, but stood feeling his whisker and\r\nlooking dejectedly at me, as if he thought it really might have been a\r\nbetter speculation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XIII\r\n\r\nIt was a trial to my feelings, on the next day but one, to see\r\nJoe arraying himself in his Sunday clothes to accompany me to Miss\r\nHavisham\xe2\x80\x99s. However, as he thought his court-suit necessary to the\r\noccasion, it was not for me to tell him that he looked far better in his\r\nworking-dress; the rather, because I knew he made himself so dreadfully\r\nuncomfortable, entirely on my account, and that it was for me he pulled\r\nup his shirt-collar so very high behind, that it made the hair on the\r\ncrown of his head stand up like a tuft of feathers.\r\n\r\nAt breakfast-time my sister declared her intention of going to town with\r\nus, and being left at Uncle Pumblechook\xe2\x80\x99s and called for \xe2\x80\x9cwhen we had\r\ndone with our fine ladies\xe2\x80\x9d--a way of putting the case, from which Joe\r\nappeared inclined to augur the worst. The forge was shut up for the day,\r\nand Joe inscribed in chalk upon the door (as it was his custom to do on\r\nthe very rare occasions when he was not at work) the monosyllable\r\nHOUT, accompanied by a sketch of an arrow supposed to be flying in the\r\ndirection he had taken.\r\n\r\nWe walked to town, my sister leading the way in a very large beaver\r\nbonnet, and carrying a basket like the Great Seal of England in plaited\r\nStraw, a pair of pattens, a spare shawl, and an umbrella, though it\r\nwas a fine bright day. I am not quite clear whether these articles were\r\ncarried penitentially or ostentatiously; but I rather think they were\r\ndisplayed as articles of property,--much as Cleopatra or any other\r\nsovereign lady on the Rampage might exhibit her wealth in a pageant or\r\nprocession.\r\n\r\nWhen we came to Pumblechook\xe2\x80\x99s, my sister bounced in and left us. As it\r\nwas almost noon, Joe and I held straight on to Miss Havisham\xe2\x80\x99s house.\r\nEstella opened the gate as usual, and, the moment she appeared, Joe took\r\nhis hat off and stood weighing it by the brim in both his hands; as if\r\nhe had some urgent reason in his mind for being particular to half a\r\nquarter of an ounce.\r\n\r\nEstella took no notice of either of us, but led us the way that I knew\r\nso well. I followed next to her, and Joe came last. When I looked back\r\nat Joe in the long passage, he was still weighing his hat with the\r\ngreatest care, and was coming after us in long strides on the tips of\r\nhis toes.\r\n\r\nEstella told me we were both to go in, so I took Joe by the coat-cuff\r\nand conducted him into Miss Havisham\xe2\x80\x99s presence. She was seated at her\r\ndressing-table, and looked round at us immediately.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d said she to Joe. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are the husband of the sister of this boy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI could hardly have imagined dear old Joe looking so unlike himself or\r\nso like some extraordinary bird; standing as he did speechless, with his\r\ntuft of feathers ruffled, and his mouth open as if he wanted a worm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are the husband,\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Miss Havisham, \xe2\x80\x9cof the sister of this\r\nboy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was very aggravating; but, throughout the interview, Joe persisted in\r\naddressing Me instead of Miss Havisham.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhich I meantersay, Pip,\xe2\x80\x9d Joe now observed in a manner that was at\r\nonce expressive of forcible argumentation, strict confidence, and great\r\npoliteness, \xe2\x80\x9cas I hup and married your sister, and I were at the time\r\nwhat you might call (if you was anyways inclined) a single man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell!\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Havisham. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd you have reared the boy, with the\r\nintention of taking him for your apprentice; is that so, Mr. Gargery?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know, Pip,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Joe, \xe2\x80\x9cas you and me were ever friends, and it\r\nwere looked for\xe2\x80\x99ard to betwixt us, as being calc\xe2\x80\x99lated to lead to\r\nlarks. Not but what, Pip, if you had ever made objections to the\r\nbusiness,--such as its being open to black and sut, or such-like,--not\r\nbut what they would have been attended to, don\xe2\x80\x99t you see?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHas the boy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Havisham, \xe2\x80\x9cever made any objection? Does he\r\nlike the trade?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhich it is well beknown to yourself, Pip,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Joe, strengthening\r\nhis former mixture of argumentation, confidence, and politeness, \xe2\x80\x9cthat\r\nit were the wish of your own hart.\xe2\x80\x9d (I saw the idea suddenly break upon\r\nhim that he would adapt his epitaph to the occasion, before he went on\r\nto say) \xe2\x80\x9cAnd there weren\xe2\x80\x99t no objection on your part, and Pip it were\r\nthe great wish of your hart!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was quite in vain for me to endeavor to make him sensible that he\r\nought to speak to Miss Havisham. The more I made faces and gestures\r\nto him to do it, the more confidential, argumentative, and polite, he\r\npersisted in being to Me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you brought his indentures with you?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Miss Havisham.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Pip, you know,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Joe, as if that were a little\r\nunreasonable, \xe2\x80\x9cyou yourself see me put \xe2\x80\x98em in my \xe2\x80\x98at, and therefore you\r\nknow as they are here.\xe2\x80\x9d With which he took them out, and gave them, not\r\nto Miss Havisham, but to me. I am afraid I was ashamed of the dear good\r\nfellow,--I know I was ashamed of him,--when I saw that Estella stood\r\nat the back of Miss Havisham\xe2\x80\x99s chair, and that her eyes laughed\r\nmischievously. I took the indentures out of his hand and gave them to\r\nMiss Havisham.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou expected,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Havisham, as she looked them over, \xe2\x80\x9cno premium\r\nwith the boy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJoe!\xe2\x80\x9d I remonstrated, for he made no reply at all. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy don\xe2\x80\x99t you\r\nanswer--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPip,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Joe, cutting me short as if he were hurt, \xe2\x80\x9cwhich I\r\nmeantersay that were not a question requiring a answer betwixt yourself\r\nand me, and which you know the answer to be full well No. You know it to\r\nbe No, Pip, and wherefore should I say it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Havisham glanced at him as if she understood what he really was\r\nbetter than I had thought possible, seeing what he was there; and took\r\nup a little bag from the table beside her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPip has earned a premium here,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cand here it is. There are\r\nfive-and-twenty guineas in this bag. Give it to your master, Pip.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs if he were absolutely out of his mind with the wonder awakened in\r\nhim by her strange figure and the strange room, Joe, even at this pass,\r\npersisted in addressing me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is wery liberal on your part, Pip,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe, \xe2\x80\x9cand it is as such\r\nreceived and grateful welcome, though never looked for, far nor near,\r\nnor nowheres. And now, old chap,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe, conveying to me a sensation,\r\nfirst of burning and then of freezing, for I felt as if that familiar\r\nexpression were applied to Miss Havisham,--\xe2\x80\x9cand now, old chap, may we\r\ndo our duty! May you and me do our duty, both on us, by one and another,\r\nand by them which your liberal present--have-conweyed--to be--for the\r\nsatisfaction of mind-of--them as never--\xe2\x80\x9d here Joe showed that he felt\r\nhe had fallen into frightful difficulties, until he triumphantly rescued\r\nhimself with the words, \xe2\x80\x9cand from myself far be it!\xe2\x80\x9d These words had\r\nsuch a round and convincing sound for him that he said them twice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-bye, Pip!\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Havisham. \xe2\x80\x9cLet them out, Estella.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAm I to come again, Miss Havisham?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. Gargery is your master now. Gargery! One word!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThus calling him back as I went out of the door, I heard her say to Joe\r\nin a distinct emphatic voice, \xe2\x80\x9cThe boy has been a good boy here, and\r\nthat is his reward. Of course, as an honest man, you will expect no\r\nother and no more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHow Joe got out of the room, I have never been able to determine; but\r\nI know that when he did get out he was steadily proceeding upstairs\r\ninstead of coming down, and was deaf to all remonstrances until I went\r\nafter him and laid hold of him. In another minute we were outside the\r\ngate, and it was locked, and Estella was gone. When we stood in the\r\ndaylight alone again, Joe backed up against a wall, and said to me,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAstonishing!\xe2\x80\x9d And there he remained so long saying, \xe2\x80\x9cAstonishing\xe2\x80\x9d at\r\nintervals, so often, that I began to think his senses were never coming\r\nback. At length he prolonged his remark into \xe2\x80\x9cPip, I do assure you this\r\nis as-TON-ishing!\xe2\x80\x9d and so, by degrees, became conversational and able to\r\nwalk away.\r\n\r\nI have reason to think that Joe\xe2\x80\x99s intellects were brightened by the\r\nencounter they had passed through, and that on our way to Pumblechook\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhe invented a subtle and deep design. My reason is to be found in\r\nwhat took place in Mr. Pumblechook\xe2\x80\x99s parlor: where, on our presenting\r\nourselves, my sister sat in conference with that detested seedsman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d cried my sister, addressing us both at once. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd what\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhappened to you? I wonder you condescend to come back to such poor\r\nsociety as this, I am sure I do!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Havisham,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe, with a fixed look at me, like an effort of\r\nremembrance, \xe2\x80\x9cmade it wery partick\xe2\x80\x99ler that we should give her--were it\r\ncompliments or respects, Pip?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCompliments,\xe2\x80\x9d I said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhich that were my own belief,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Joe; \xe2\x80\x9cher compliments to Mrs.\r\nJ. Gargery--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMuch good they\xe2\x80\x99ll do me!\xe2\x80\x9d observed my sister; but rather gratified too.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd wishing,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued Joe, with another fixed look at me, like another\r\neffort of remembrance, \xe2\x80\x9cthat the state of Miss Havisham\xe2\x80\x99s elth were\r\nsitch as would have--allowed, were it, Pip?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf her having the pleasure,\xe2\x80\x9d I added.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf ladies\xe2\x80\x99 company,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe. And drew a long breath.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell!\xe2\x80\x9d cried my sister, with a mollified glance at Mr. Pumblechook.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe might have had the politeness to send that message at first, but\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s better late than never. And what did she give young Rantipole\r\nhere?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe giv\xe2\x80\x99 him,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe, \xe2\x80\x9cnothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Joe was going to break out, but Joe went on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat she giv\xe2\x80\x99,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe, \xe2\x80\x9cshe giv\xe2\x80\x99 to his friends. \xe2\x80\x98And by his\r\nfriends,\xe2\x80\x99 were her explanation, \xe2\x80\x98I mean into the hands of his sister\r\nMrs. J. Gargery.\xe2\x80\x99 Them were her words; \xe2\x80\x98Mrs. J. Gargery.\xe2\x80\x99 She mayn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nhave know\xe2\x80\x99d,\xe2\x80\x9d added Joe, with an appearance of reflection, \xe2\x80\x9cwhether it\r\nwere Joe, or Jorge.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMy sister looked at Pumblechook: who smoothed the elbows of his wooden\r\narm-chair, and nodded at her and at the fire, as if he had known all\r\nabout it beforehand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd how much have you got?\xe2\x80\x9d asked my sister, laughing. Positively\r\nlaughing!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat would present company say to ten pound?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded Joe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99d say,\xe2\x80\x9d returned my sister, curtly, \xe2\x80\x9cpretty well. Not too much,\r\nbut pretty well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s more than that, then,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe.\r\n\r\nThat fearful Impostor, Pumblechook, immediately nodded, and said, as he\r\nrubbed the arms of his chair, \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s more than that, Mum.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, you don\xe2\x80\x99t mean to say--\xe2\x80\x9d began my sister.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes I do, Mum,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pumblechook; \xe2\x80\x9cbut wait a bit. Go on, Joseph. Good\r\nin you! Go on!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat would present company say,\xe2\x80\x9d proceeded Joe, \xe2\x80\x9cto twenty pound?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHandsome would be the word,\xe2\x80\x9d returned my sister.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe, \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s more than twenty pound.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat abject hypocrite, Pumblechook, nodded again, and said, with a\r\npatronizing laugh, \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s more than that, Mum. Good again! Follow her up,\r\nJoseph!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen to make an end of it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe, delightedly handing the bag to my\r\nsister; \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s five-and-twenty pound.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s five-and-twenty pound, Mum,\xe2\x80\x9d echoed that basest of swindlers,\r\nPumblechook, rising to shake hands with her; \xe2\x80\x9cand it\xe2\x80\x99s no more than your\r\nmerits (as I said when my opinion was asked), and I wish you joy of the\r\nmoney!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIf the villain had stopped here, his case would have been sufficiently\r\nawful, but he blackened his guilt by proceeding to take me into custody,\r\nwith a right of patronage that left all his former criminality far\r\nbehind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow you see, Joseph and wife,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pumblechook, as he took me by the\r\narm above the elbow, \xe2\x80\x9cI am one of them that always go right through with\r\nwhat they\xe2\x80\x99ve begun. This boy must be bound, out of hand. That\xe2\x80\x99s my way.\r\nBound out of hand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGoodness knows, Uncle Pumblechook,\xe2\x80\x9d said my sister (grasping the\r\nmoney), \xe2\x80\x9cwe\xe2\x80\x99re deeply beholden to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind me, Mum,\xe2\x80\x9d returned that diabolical cornchandler. \xe2\x80\x9cA\r\npleasure\xe2\x80\x99s a pleasure all the world over. But this boy, you know; we\r\nmust have him bound. I said I\xe2\x80\x99d see to it--to tell you the truth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Justices were sitting in the Town Hall near at hand, and we at\r\nonce went over to have me bound apprentice to Joe in the Magisterial\r\npresence. I say we went over, but I was pushed over by Pumblechook,\r\nexactly as if I had that moment picked a pocket or fired a rick; indeed,\r\nit was the general impression in Court that I had been taken red-handed;\r\nfor, as Pumblechook shoved me before him through the crowd, I heard some\r\npeople say, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s he done?\xe2\x80\x9d and others, \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s a young \xe2\x80\x98un, too, but\r\nlooks bad, don\xe2\x80\x99t he?\xe2\x80\x9d One person of mild and benevolent aspect even gave\r\nme a tract ornamented with a woodcut of a malevolent young man fitted\r\nup with a perfect sausage-shop of fetters, and entitled TO BE READ IN MY\r\nCELL.\r\n\r\nThe Hall was a queer place, I thought, with higher pews in it than a\r\nchurch,--and with people hanging over the pews looking on,--and with\r\nmighty Justices (one with a powdered head) leaning back in chairs, with\r\nfolded arms, or taking snuff, or going to sleep, or writing, or reading\r\nthe newspapers,--and with some shining black portraits on the walls,\r\nwhich my unartistic eye regarded as a composition of hardbake and\r\nsticking-plaster. Here, in a corner my indentures were duly signed and\r\nattested, and I was \xe2\x80\x9cbound\xe2\x80\x9d; Mr. Pumblechook holding me all the while\r\nas if we had looked in on our way to the scaffold, to have those little\r\npreliminaries disposed of.\r\n\r\nWhen we had come out again, and had got rid of the boys who had been put\r\ninto great spirits by the expectation of seeing me publicly tortured,\r\nand who were much disappointed to find that my friends were merely\r\nrallying round me, we went back to Pumblechook\xe2\x80\x99s. And there my sister\r\nbecame so excited by the twenty-five guineas, that nothing would serve\r\nher but we must have a dinner out of that windfall at the Blue Boar, and\r\nthat Pumblechook must go over in his chaise-cart, and bring the Hubbles\r\nand Mr. Wopsle.\r\n\r\nIt was agreed to be done; and a most melancholy day I passed. For,\r\nit inscrutably appeared to stand to reason, in the minds of the whole\r\ncompany, that I was an excrescence on the entertainment. And to make it\r\nworse, they all asked me from time to time,--in short, whenever they\r\nhad nothing else to do,--why I didn\xe2\x80\x99t enjoy myself? And what could I\r\npossibly do then, but say I was enjoying myself,--when I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t!\r\n\r\nHowever, they were grown up and had their own way, and they made the\r\nmost of it. That swindling Pumblechook, exalted into the beneficent\r\ncontriver of the whole occasion, actually took the top of the table;\r\nand, when he addressed them on the subject of my being bound, and had\r\nfiendishly congratulated them on my being liable to imprisonment if I\r\nplayed at cards, drank strong liquors, kept late hours or bad company,\r\nor indulged in other vagaries which the form of my indentures appeared\r\nto contemplate as next to inevitable, he placed me standing on a chair\r\nbeside him to illustrate his remarks.\r\n\r\nMy only other remembrances of the great festival are, That they wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nlet me go to sleep, but whenever they saw me dropping off, woke me up\r\nand told me to enjoy myself. That, rather late in the evening Mr. Wopsle\r\ngave us Collins\xe2\x80\x99s ode, and threw his bloodstained sword in thunder\r\ndown, with such effect, that a waiter came in and said, \xe2\x80\x9cThe Commercials\r\nunderneath sent up their compliments, and it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the Tumblers\xe2\x80\x99 Arms.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n That, they were all in excellent spirits on the road home, and sang, O\r\nLady Fair! Mr. Wopsle taking the bass, and asserting with a tremendously\r\nstrong voice (in reply to the inquisitive bore who leads that piece\r\nof music in a most impertinent manner, by wanting to know all about\r\neverybody\xe2\x80\x99s private affairs) that he was the man with his white locks\r\nflowing, and that he was upon the whole the weakest pilgrim going.\r\n\r\nFinally, I remember that when I got into my little bedroom, I was truly\r\nwretched, and had a strong conviction on me that I should never like\r\nJoe\xe2\x80\x99s trade. I had liked it once, but once was not now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XIV\r\n\r\nIt is a most miserable thing to feel ashamed of home. There may be black\r\ningratitude in the thing, and the punishment may be retributive and well\r\ndeserved; but that it is a miserable thing, I can testify.\r\n\r\nHome had never been a very pleasant place to me, because of my sister\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntemper. But, Joe had sanctified it, and I had believed in it. I had\r\nbelieved in the best parlor as a most elegant saloon; I had believed\r\nin the front door, as a mysterious portal of the Temple of State whose\r\nsolemn opening was attended with a sacrifice of roast fowls; I had\r\nbelieved in the kitchen as a chaste though not magnificent apartment;\r\nI had believed in the forge as the glowing road to manhood and\r\nindependence. Within a single year all this was changed. Now it was all\r\ncoarse and common, and I would not have had Miss Havisham and Estella\r\nsee it on any account.\r\n\r\nHow much of my ungracious condition of mind may have been my own fault,\r\nhow much Miss Havisham\xe2\x80\x99s, how much my sister\xe2\x80\x99s, is now of no moment to\r\nme or to any one. The change was made in me; the thing was done. Well or\r\nill done, excusably or inexcusably, it was done.\r\n\r\nOnce, it had seemed to me that when I should at last roll up my\r\nshirt-sleeves and go into the forge, Joe\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98prentice, I should be\r\ndistinguished and happy. Now the reality was in my hold, I only felt\r\nthat I was dusty with the dust of small-coal, and that I had a weight\r\nupon my daily remembrance to which the anvil was a feather. There have\r\nbeen occasions in my later life (I suppose as in most lives) when I have\r\nfelt for a time as if a thick curtain had fallen on all its interest\r\nand romance, to shut me out from anything save dull endurance any more.\r\nNever has that curtain dropped so heavy and blank, as when my way in\r\nlife lay stretched out straight before me through the newly entered road\r\nof apprenticeship to Joe.\r\n\r\nI remember that at a later period of my \xe2\x80\x9ctime,\xe2\x80\x9d I used to stand about\r\nthe churchyard on Sunday evenings when night was falling, comparing my\r\nown perspective with the windy marsh view, and making out some likeness\r\nbetween them by thinking how flat and low both were, and how on both\r\nthere came an unknown way and a dark mist and then the sea. I was quite\r\nas dejected on the first working-day of my apprenticeship as in that\r\nafter-time; but I am glad to know that I never breathed a murmur to Joe\r\nwhile my indentures lasted. It is about the only thing I am glad to know\r\nof myself in that connection.\r\n\r\nFor, though it includes what I proceed to add, all the merit of what I\r\nproceed to add was Joe\xe2\x80\x99s. It was not because I was faithful, but because\r\nJoe was faithful, that I never ran away and went for a soldier or\r\na sailor. It was not because I had a strong sense of the virtue of\r\nindustry, but because Joe had a strong sense of the virtue of industry,\r\nthat I worked with tolerable zeal against the grain. It is not possible\r\nto know how far the influence of any amiable honest-hearted duty-doing\r\nman flies out into the world; but it is very possible to know how it has\r\ntouched one\xe2\x80\x99s self in going by, and I know right well that any good that\r\nintermixed itself with my apprenticeship came of plain contented Joe,\r\nand not of restlessly aspiring discontented me.\r\n\r\nWhat I wanted, who can say? How can I say, when I never knew? What\r\nI dreaded was, that in some unlucky hour I, being at my grimiest and\r\ncommonest, should lift up my eyes and see Estella looking in at one\r\nof the wooden windows of the forge. I was haunted by the fear that she\r\nwould, sooner or later, find me out, with a black face and hands, doing\r\nthe coarsest part of my work, and would exult over me and despise me.\r\nOften after dark, when I was pulling the bellows for Joe, and we were\r\nsinging Old Clem, and when the thought how we used to sing it at Miss\r\nHavisham\xe2\x80\x99s would seem to show me Estella\xe2\x80\x99s face in the fire, with her\r\npretty hair fluttering in the wind and her eyes scorning me,--often at\r\nsuch a time I would look towards those panels of black night in the wall\r\nwhich the wooden windows then were, and would fancy that I saw her just\r\ndrawing her face away, and would believe that she had come at last.\r\n\r\nAfter that, when we went into supper, the place and the meal would have\r\na more homely look than ever, and I would feel more ashamed of home than\r\never, in my own ungracious breast.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XV\r\n\r\nAs I was getting too big for Mr. Wopsle\xe2\x80\x99s great-aunt\xe2\x80\x99s room, my\r\neducation under that preposterous female terminated. Not, however, until\r\nBiddy had imparted to me everything she knew, from the little catalogue\r\nof prices, to a comic song she had once bought for a half-penny.\r\nAlthough the only coherent part of the latter piece of literature were\r\nthe opening lines.\r\n\r\n     When I went to Lunnon town sirs,\r\n     Too rul loo rul\r\n     Too rul loo rul\r\n     Wasn\xe2\x80\x99t I done very brown sirs?\r\n     Too rul loo rul\r\n     Too rul loo rul\r\n\r\n--still, in my desire to be wiser, I got this composition by heart with the utmost gravity; nor do I recollect that I questioned its merit, except that I\r\nthought (as I still do) the amount of Too rul somewhat in excess of the\r\npoetry. In my hunger for information, I made proposals to Mr. Wopsle to\r\nbestow some intellectual crumbs upon me, with which he kindly complied.\r\nAs it turned out, however, that he only wanted me for a dramatic\r\nlay-figure, to be contradicted and embraced and wept over and bullied\r\nand clutched and stabbed and knocked about in a variety of ways, I soon\r\ndeclined that course of instruction; though not until Mr. Wopsle in his\r\npoetic fury had severely mauled me.\r\n\r\nWhatever I acquired, I tried to impart to Joe. This statement sounds so\r\nwell, that I cannot in my conscience let it pass unexplained. I wanted\r\nto make Joe less ignorant and common, that he might be worthier of my\r\nsociety and less open to Estella\xe2\x80\x99s reproach.\r\n\r\nThe old Battery out on the marshes was our place of study, and a broken\r\nslate and a short piece of slate-pencil were our educational implements:\r\nto which Joe always added a pipe of tobacco. I never knew Joe to\r\nremember anything from one Sunday to another, or to acquire, under my\r\ntuition, any piece of information whatever. Yet he would smoke his pipe\r\nat the Battery with a far more sagacious air than anywhere else,--even\r\nwith a learned air,--as if he considered himself to be advancing\r\nimmensely. Dear fellow, I hope he did.\r\n\r\nIt was pleasant and quiet, out there with the sails on the river passing\r\nbeyond the earthwork, and sometimes, when the tide was low, looking\r\nas if they belonged to sunken ships that were still sailing on at the\r\nbottom of the water. Whenever I watched the vessels standing out to sea\r\nwith their white sails spread, I somehow thought of Miss Havisham and\r\nEstella; and whenever the light struck aslant, afar off, upon a cloud\r\nor sail or green hillside or water-line, it was just the same.--Miss\r\nHavisham and Estella and the strange house and the strange life appeared\r\nto have something to do with everything that was picturesque.\r\n\r\nOne Sunday when Joe, greatly enjoying his pipe, had so plumed himself on\r\nbeing \xe2\x80\x9cmost awful dull,\xe2\x80\x9d that I had given him up for the day, I lay on\r\nthe earthwork for some time with my chin on my hand, descrying traces of\r\nMiss Havisham and Estella all over the prospect, in the sky and in the\r\nwater, until at last I resolved to mention a thought concerning them\r\nthat had been much in my head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJoe,\xe2\x80\x9d said I; \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t you think I ought to make Miss Havisham a visit?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Pip,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Joe, slowly considering. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat for?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat for, Joe? What is any visit made for?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is some wisits p\xe2\x80\x99r\xe2\x80\x99aps,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe, \xe2\x80\x9cas for ever remains open to\r\nthe question, Pip. But in regard to wisiting Miss Havisham. She might\r\nthink you wanted something,--expected something of her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you think I might say that I did not, Joe?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou might, old chap,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd she might credit it. Similarly she\r\nmightn\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJoe felt, as I did, that he had made a point there, and he pulled hard\r\nat his pipe to keep himself from weakening it by repetition.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou see, Pip,\xe2\x80\x9d Joe pursued, as soon as he was past that danger, \xe2\x80\x9cMiss\r\nHavisham done the handsome thing by you. When Miss Havisham done the\r\nhandsome thing by you, she called me back to say to me as that were\r\nall.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Joe. I heard her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cALL,\xe2\x80\x9d Joe repeated, very emphatically.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Joe. I tell you, I heard her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhich I meantersay, Pip, it might be that her meaning were,--Make a\r\nend on it!--As you was!--Me to the North, and you to the South!--Keep in\r\nsunders!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI had thought of that too, and it was very far from comforting to me\r\nto find that he had thought of it; for it seemed to render it more\r\nprobable.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, Joe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, old chap.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere am I, getting on in the first year of my time, and, since the day\r\nof my being bound, I have never thanked Miss Havisham, or asked after\r\nher, or shown that I remember her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s true, Pip; and unless you was to turn her out a set of shoes\r\nall four round,--and which I meantersay as even a set of shoes all\r\nfour round might not be acceptable as a present, in a total wacancy of\r\nhoofs--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t mean that sort of remembrance, Joe; I don\xe2\x80\x99t mean a present.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Joe had got the idea of a present in his head and must harp upon it.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOr even,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cif you was helped to knocking her up a new chain\r\nfor the front door,--or say a gross or two of shark-headed screws for\r\ngeneral use,--or some light fancy article, such as a toasting-fork\r\nwhen she took her muffins,--or a gridiron when she took a sprat or such\r\nlike--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t mean any present at all, Joe,\xe2\x80\x9d I interposed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe, still harping on it as though I had particularly\r\npressed it, \xe2\x80\x9cif I was yourself, Pip, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t. No, I would not. For\r\nwhat\xe2\x80\x99s a door-chain when she\xe2\x80\x99s got one always up? And shark-headers is\r\nopen to misrepresentations. And if it was a toasting-fork, you\xe2\x80\x99d go into\r\nbrass and do yourself no credit. And the oncommonest workman can\xe2\x80\x99t show\r\nhimself oncommon in a gridiron,--for a gridiron IS a gridiron,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nJoe, steadfastly impressing it upon me, as if he were endeavouring to\r\nrouse me from a fixed delusion, \xe2\x80\x9cand you may haim at what you like, but\r\na gridiron it will come out, either by your leave or again your leave,\r\nand you can\xe2\x80\x99t help yourself--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear Joe,\xe2\x80\x9d I cried, in desperation, taking hold of his coat, \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ngo on in that way. I never thought of making Miss Havisham any present.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Pip,\xe2\x80\x9d Joe assented, as if he had been contending for that, all\r\nalong; \xe2\x80\x9cand what I say to you is, you are right, Pip.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Joe; but what I wanted to say, was, that as we are rather slack\r\njust now, if you would give me a half-holiday to-morrow, I think I would\r\ngo uptown and make a call on Miss Est--Havisham.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhich her name,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe, gravely, \xe2\x80\x9cain\xe2\x80\x99t Estavisham, Pip, unless she\r\nhave been rechris\xe2\x80\x99ened.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know, Joe, I know. It was a slip of mine. What do you think of it,\r\nJoe?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn brief, Joe thought that if I thought well of it, he thought well of\r\nit. But, he was particular in stipulating that if I were not received\r\nwith cordiality, or if I were not encouraged to repeat my visit as a\r\nvisit which had no ulterior object but was simply one of gratitude for a\r\nfavor received, then this experimental trip should have no successor. By\r\nthese conditions I promised to abide.\r\n\r\nNow, Joe kept a journeyman at weekly wages whose name was Orlick.\r\nHe pretended that his Christian name was Dolge,--a clear\r\nImpossibility,--but he was a fellow of that obstinate disposition that I\r\nbelieve him to have been the prey of no delusion in this particular, but\r\nwilfully to have imposed that name upon the village as an affront to its\r\nunderstanding. He was a broadshouldered loose-limbed swarthy fellow of\r\ngreat strength, never in a hurry, and always slouching. He never even\r\nseemed to come to his work on purpose, but would slouch in as if by mere\r\naccident; and when he went to the Jolly Bargemen to eat his dinner, or\r\nwent away at night, he would slouch out, like Cain or the Wandering Jew,\r\nas if he had no idea where he was going and no intention of ever\r\ncoming back. He lodged at a sluice-keeper\xe2\x80\x99s out on the marshes, and on\r\nworking-days would come slouching from his hermitage, with his hands in\r\nhis pockets and his dinner loosely tied in a bundle round his neck\r\nand dangling on his back. On Sundays he mostly lay all day on the\r\nsluice-gates, or stood against ricks and barns. He always slouched,\r\nlocomotively, with his eyes on the ground; and, when accosted or\r\notherwise required to raise them, he looked up in a half-resentful,\r\nhalf-puzzled way, as though the only thought he ever had was, that it\r\nwas rather an odd and injurious fact that he should never be thinking.\r\n\r\nThis morose journeyman had no liking for me. When I was very small and\r\ntimid, he gave me to understand that the Devil lived in a black corner\r\nof the forge, and that he knew the fiend very well: also that it was\r\nnecessary to make up the fire, once in seven years, with a live boy, and\r\nthat I might consider myself fuel. When I became Joe\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98prentice, Orlick\r\nwas perhaps confirmed in some suspicion that I should displace him;\r\nhowbeit, he liked me still less. Not that he ever said anything, or did\r\nanything, openly importing hostility; I only noticed that he always beat\r\nhis sparks in my direction, and that whenever I sang Old Clem, he came\r\nin out of time.\r\n\r\nDolge Orlick was at work and present, next day, when I reminded Joe of\r\nmy half-holiday. He said nothing at the moment, for he and Joe had just\r\ngot a piece of hot iron between them, and I was at the bellows; but by\r\nand by he said, leaning on his hammer,--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, master! Sure you\xe2\x80\x99re not a going to favor only one of us. If Young\r\nPip has a half-holiday, do as much for Old Orlick.\xe2\x80\x9d I suppose he was\r\nabout five-and-twenty, but he usually spoke of himself as an ancient\r\nperson.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, what\xe2\x80\x99ll you do with a half-holiday, if you get it?\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99ll I do with it! What\xe2\x80\x99ll he do with it? I\xe2\x80\x99ll do as much with it as\r\nhim,\xe2\x80\x9d said Orlick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs to Pip, he\xe2\x80\x99s going up town,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell then, as to Old Orlick, he\xe2\x80\x99s a going up town,\xe2\x80\x9d retorted that\r\nworthy. \xe2\x80\x9cTwo can go up town. Tain\xe2\x80\x99t only one wot can go up town.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t lose your temper,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall if I like,\xe2\x80\x9d growled Orlick. \xe2\x80\x9cSome and their uptowning! Now,\r\nmaster! Come. No favoring in this shop. Be a man!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe master refusing to entertain the subject until the journeyman was in\r\na better temper, Orlick plunged at the furnace, drew out a red-hot\r\nbar, made at me with it as if he were going to run it through my body,\r\nwhisked it round my head, laid it on the anvil, hammered it out,--as\r\nif it were I, I thought, and the sparks were my spirting blood,--and\r\nfinally said, when he had hammered himself hot and the iron cold, and he\r\nagain leaned on his hammer,--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, master!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you all right now?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded Joe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! I am all right,\xe2\x80\x9d said gruff Old Orlick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen, as in general you stick to your work as well as most men,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nJoe, \xe2\x80\x9clet it be a half-holiday for all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMy sister had been standing silent in the yard, within hearing,--she was\r\na most unscrupulous spy and listener,--and she instantly looked in at\r\none of the windows.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLike you, you fool!\xe2\x80\x9d said she to Joe, \xe2\x80\x9cgiving holidays to great idle\r\nhulkers like that. You are a rich man, upon my life, to waste wages in\r\nthat way. I wish I was his master!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99d be everybody\xe2\x80\x99s master, if you durst,\xe2\x80\x9d retorted Orlick, with an\r\nill-favored grin.\r\n\r\n(\xe2\x80\x9cLet her alone,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe.)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d be a match for all noodles and all rogues,\xe2\x80\x9d returned my sister,\r\nbeginning to work herself into a mighty rage. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be a\r\nmatch for the noodles, without being a match for your master, who\xe2\x80\x99s the\r\ndunder-headed king of the noodles. And I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be a match for the\r\nrogues, without being a match for you, who are the blackest-looking and\r\nthe worst rogue between this and France. Now!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re a foul shrew, Mother Gargery,\xe2\x80\x9d growled the journeyman. \xe2\x80\x9cIf that\r\nmakes a judge of rogues, you ought to be a good\xe2\x80\x99un.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n(\xe2\x80\x9cLet her alone, will you?\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe.)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat did you say?\xe2\x80\x9d cried my sister, beginning to scream. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat did you\r\nsay? What did that fellow Orlick say to me, Pip? What did he call me,\r\nwith my husband standing by? Oh! oh! oh!\xe2\x80\x9d Each of these exclamations was\r\na shriek; and I must remark of my sister, what is equally true of all\r\nthe violent women I have ever seen, that passion was no excuse for\r\nher, because it is undeniable that instead of lapsing into passion, she\r\nconsciously and deliberately took extraordinary pains to force herself\r\ninto it, and became blindly furious by regular stages; \xe2\x80\x9cwhat was the\r\nname he gave me before the base man who swore to defend me? Oh! Hold me!\r\nOh!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh-h-h!\xe2\x80\x9d growled the journeyman, between his teeth, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d hold you, if\r\nyou was my wife. I\xe2\x80\x99d hold you under the pump, and choke it out of you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n(\xe2\x80\x9cI tell you, let her alone,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe.)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! To hear him!\xe2\x80\x9d cried my sister, with a clap of her hands and a\r\nscream together,--which was her next stage. \xe2\x80\x9cTo hear the names he\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngiving me! That Orlick! In my own house! Me, a married woman! With my\r\nhusband standing by! Oh! Oh!\xe2\x80\x9d Here my sister, after a fit of clappings\r\nand screamings, beat her hands upon her bosom and upon her knees, and\r\nthrew her cap off, and pulled her hair down,--which were the last stages\r\non her road to frenzy. Being by this time a perfect Fury and a complete\r\nsuccess, she made a dash at the door which I had fortunately locked.\r\n\r\nWhat could the wretched Joe do now, after his disregarded parenthetical\r\ninterruptions, but stand up to his journeyman, and ask him what he meant\r\nby interfering betwixt himself and Mrs. Joe; and further whether he was\r\nman enough to come on? Old Orlick felt that the situation admitted of\r\nnothing less than coming on, and was on his defence straightway; so,\r\nwithout so much as pulling off their singed and burnt aprons, they went\r\nat one another, like two giants. But, if any man in that neighborhood\r\ncould stand uplong against Joe, I never saw the man. Orlick, as if he\r\nhad been of no more account than the pale young gentleman, was very\r\nsoon among the coal-dust, and in no hurry to come out of it. Then Joe\r\nunlocked the door and picked up my sister, who had dropped insensible\r\nat the window (but who had seen the fight first, I think), and who was\r\ncarried into the house and laid down, and who was recommended to revive,\r\nand would do nothing but struggle and clench her hands in Joe\xe2\x80\x99s hair.\r\nThen, came that singular calm and silence which succeed all uproars; and\r\nthen, with the vague sensation which I have always connected with such\r\na lull,--namely, that it was Sunday, and somebody was dead,--I went upstairs\r\nto dress myself.\r\n\r\nWhen I came down again, I found Joe and Orlick sweeping up, without any\r\nother traces of discomposure than a slit in one of Orlick\xe2\x80\x99s nostrils,\r\nwhich was neither expressive nor ornamental. A pot of beer had appeared\r\nfrom the Jolly Bargemen, and they were sharing it by turns in a\r\npeaceable manner. The lull had a sedative and philosophical influence on\r\nJoe, who followed me out into the road to say, as a parting observation\r\nthat might do me good, \xe2\x80\x9cOn the Rampage, Pip, and off the Rampage,\r\nPip:--such is Life!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith what absurd emotions (for we think the feelings that are very\r\nserious in a man quite comical in a boy) I found myself again going to\r\nMiss Havisham\xe2\x80\x99s, matters little here. Nor, how I passed and repassed\r\nthe gate many times before I could make up my mind to ring. Nor, how\r\nI debated whether I should go away without ringing; nor, how I should\r\nundoubtedly have gone, if my time had been my own, to come back.\r\n\r\nMiss Sarah Pocket came to the gate. No Estella.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow, then? You here again?\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Pocket. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you want?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen I said that I only came to see how Miss Havisham was, Sarah\r\nevidently deliberated whether or no she should send me about my\r\nbusiness. But unwilling to hazard the responsibility, she let me in, and\r\npresently brought the sharp message that I was to \xe2\x80\x9ccome up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEverything was unchanged, and Miss Havisham was alone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d said she, fixing her eyes upon me. \xe2\x80\x9cI hope you want nothing?\r\nYou\xe2\x80\x99ll get nothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo indeed, Miss Havisham. I only wanted you to know that I am doing\r\nvery well in my apprenticeship, and am always much obliged to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere, there!\xe2\x80\x9d with the old restless fingers. \xe2\x80\x9cCome now and then; come\r\non your birthday.--Ay!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried suddenly, turning herself and her\r\nchair towards me, \xe2\x80\x9cYou are looking round for Estella? Hey?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI had been looking round,--in fact, for Estella,--and I stammered that I\r\nhoped she was well.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAbroad,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Havisham; \xe2\x80\x9ceducating for a lady; far out of reach;\r\nprettier than ever; admired by all who see her. Do you feel that you\r\nhave lost her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was such a malignant enjoyment in her utterance of the last words,\r\nand she broke into such a disagreeable laugh, that I was at a loss what\r\nto say. She spared me the trouble of considering, by dismissing me. When\r\nthe gate was closed upon me by Sarah of the walnut-shell countenance, I\r\nfelt more than ever dissatisfied with my home and with my trade and with\r\neverything; and that was all I took by that motion.\r\n\r\nAs I was loitering along the High Street, looking in disconsolately at\r\nthe shop windows, and thinking what I would buy if I were a gentleman,\r\nwho should come out of the bookshop but Mr. Wopsle. Mr. Wopsle had in\r\nhis hand the affecting tragedy of George Barnwell, in which he had that\r\nmoment invested sixpence, with the view of heaping every word of it on\r\nthe head of Pumblechook, with whom he was going to drink tea. No sooner\r\ndid he see me, than he appeared to consider that a special Providence\r\nhad put a \xe2\x80\x98prentice in his way to be read at; and he laid hold of me,\r\nand insisted on my accompanying him to the Pumblechookian parlor. As I\r\nknew it would be miserable at home, and as the nights were dark and the\r\nway was dreary, and almost any companionship on the road was better\r\nthan none, I made no great resistance; consequently, we turned into\r\nPumblechook\xe2\x80\x99s just as the street and the shops were lighting up.\r\n\r\nAs I never assisted at any other representation of George Barnwell, I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t know how long it may usually take; but I know very well that it\r\ntook until half-past nine o\xe2\x80\x99 clock that night, and that when Mr. Wopsle\r\ngot into Newgate, I thought he never would go to the scaffold, he became\r\nso much slower than at any former period of his disgraceful career. I\r\nthought it a little too much that he should complain of being cut short\r\nin his flower after all, as if he had not been running to seed, leaf\r\nafter leaf, ever since his course began. This, however, was a\r\nmere question of length and wearisomeness. What stung me, was the\r\nidentification of the whole affair with my unoffending self. When\r\nBarnwell began to go wrong, I declare that I felt positively apologetic,\r\nPumblechook\xe2\x80\x99s indignant stare so taxed me with it. Wopsle, too, took\r\npains to present me in the worst light. At once ferocious and maudlin, I\r\nwas made to murder my uncle with no extenuating circumstances whatever;\r\nMillwood put me down in argument, on every occasion; it became sheer\r\nmonomania in my master\xe2\x80\x99s daughter to care a button for me; and all I can\r\nsay for my gasping and procrastinating conduct on the fatal morning, is,\r\nthat it was worthy of the general feebleness of my character. Even after\r\nI was happily hanged and Wopsle had closed the book, Pumblechook sat\r\nstaring at me, and shaking his head, and saying, \xe2\x80\x9cTake warning, boy,\r\ntake warning!\xe2\x80\x9d as if it were a well-known fact that I contemplated\r\nmurdering a near relation, provided I could only induce one to have the\r\nweakness to become my benefactor.\r\n\r\nIt was a very dark night when it was all over, and when I set out with\r\nMr. Wopsle on the walk home. Beyond town, we found a heavy mist out, and\r\nit fell wet and thick. The turnpike lamp was a blur, quite out of the\r\nlamp\xe2\x80\x99s usual place apparently, and its rays looked solid substance on\r\nthe fog. We were noticing this, and saying how that the mist rose with a\r\nchange of wind from a certain quarter of our marshes, when we came upon\r\na man, slouching under the lee of the turnpike house.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHalloa!\xe2\x80\x9d we said, stopping. \xe2\x80\x9cOrlick there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d he answered, slouching out. \xe2\x80\x9cI was standing by a minute, on the\r\nchance of company.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are late,\xe2\x80\x9d I remarked.\r\n\r\nOrlick not unnaturally answered, \xe2\x80\x9cWell? And you\xe2\x80\x99re late.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe have been,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Wopsle, exalted with his late performance,--\xe2\x80\x9cwe\r\nhave been indulging, Mr. Orlick, in an intellectual evening.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOld Orlick growled, as if he had nothing to say about that, and we all\r\nwent on together. I asked him presently whether he had been spending his\r\nhalf-holiday up and down town?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9call of it. I come in behind yourself. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t see you,\r\nbut I must have been pretty close behind you. By the by, the guns is\r\ngoing again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt the Hulks?\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy! There\xe2\x80\x99s some of the birds flown from the cages. The guns have been\r\ngoing since dark, about. You\xe2\x80\x99ll hear one presently.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn effect, we had not walked many yards further, when the\r\nwell-remembered boom came towards us, deadened by the mist, and heavily\r\nrolled away along the low grounds by the river, as if it were pursuing\r\nand threatening the fugitives.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA good night for cutting off in,\xe2\x80\x9d said Orlick. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99d be puzzled how to\r\nbring down a jail-bird on the wing, to-night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe subject was a suggestive one to me, and I thought about it in\r\nsilence. Mr. Wopsle, as the ill-requited uncle of the evening\xe2\x80\x99s tragedy,\r\nfell to meditating aloud in his garden at Camberwell. Orlick, with his\r\nhands in his pockets, slouched heavily at my side. It was very dark,\r\nvery wet, very muddy, and so we splashed along. Now and then, the sound\r\nof the signal cannon broke upon us again, and again rolled sulkily along\r\nthe course of the river. I kept myself to myself and my thoughts. Mr.\r\nWopsle died amiably at Camberwell, and exceedingly game on Bosworth\r\nField, and in the greatest agonies at Glastonbury. Orlick sometimes\r\ngrowled, \xe2\x80\x9cBeat it out, beat it out,--Old Clem! With a clink for the\r\nstout,--Old Clem!\xe2\x80\x9d I thought he had been drinking, but he was not drunk.\r\n\r\nThus, we came to the village. The way by which we approached it took us\r\npast the Three Jolly Bargemen, which we were surprised to find--it being\r\neleven o\xe2\x80\x99clock--in a state of commotion, with the door wide open, and\r\nunwonted lights that had been hastily caught up and put down scattered\r\nabout. Mr. Wopsle dropped into ask what was the matter (surmising that\r\na convict had been taken), but came running out in a great hurry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s something wrong,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, without stopping, \xe2\x80\x9cup at your place,\r\nPip. Run all!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked, keeping up with him. So did Orlick, at my side.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t quite understand. The house seems to have been violently\r\nentered when Joe Gargery was out. Supposed by convicts. Somebody has\r\nbeen attacked and hurt.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe were running too fast to admit of more being said, and we made no\r\nstop until we got into our kitchen. It was full of people; the whole\r\nvillage was there, or in the yard; and there was a surgeon, and there\r\nwas Joe, and there were a group of women, all on the floor in the midst\r\nof the kitchen. The unemployed bystanders drew back when they saw me,\r\nand so I became aware of my sister,--lying without sense or movement on\r\nthe bare boards where she had been knocked down by a tremendous blow\r\non the back of the head, dealt by some unknown hand when her face was\r\nturned towards the fire,--destined never to be on the Rampage again,\r\nwhile she was the wife of Joe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XVI\r\n\r\nWith my head full of George Barnwell, I was at first disposed to believe\r\nthat I must have had some hand in the attack upon my sister, or at\r\nall events that as her near relation, popularly known to be under\r\nobligations to her, I was a more legitimate object of suspicion than\r\nany one else. But when, in the clearer light of next morning, I began to\r\nreconsider the matter and to hear it discussed around me on all sides, I\r\ntook another view of the case, which was more reasonable.\r\n\r\nJoe had been at the Three Jolly Bargemen, smoking his pipe, from a\r\nquarter after eight o\xe2\x80\x99clock to a quarter before ten. While he was there,\r\nmy sister had been seen standing at the kitchen door, and had exchanged\r\nGood Night with a farm-laborer going home. The man could not be more\r\nparticular as to the time at which he saw her (he got into dense\r\nconfusion when he tried to be), than that it must have been before nine.\r\nWhen Joe went home at five minutes before ten, he found her struck down\r\non the floor, and promptly called in assistance. The fire had not then\r\nburnt unusually low, nor was the snuff of the candle very long; the\r\ncandle, however, had been blown out.\r\n\r\nNothing had been taken away from any part of the house. Neither, beyond\r\nthe blowing out of the candle,--which stood on a table between the door\r\nand my sister, and was behind her when she stood facing the fire and was\r\nstruck,--was there any disarrangement of the kitchen, excepting such\r\nas she herself had made, in falling and bleeding. But, there was one\r\nremarkable piece of evidence on the spot. She had been struck with\r\nsomething blunt and heavy, on the head and spine; after the blows were\r\ndealt, something heavy had been thrown down at her with considerable\r\nviolence, as she lay on her face. And on the ground beside her, when Joe\r\npicked her up, was a convict\xe2\x80\x99s leg-iron which had been filed asunder.\r\n\r\nNow, Joe, examining this iron with a smith\xe2\x80\x99s eye, declared it to have\r\nbeen filed asunder some time ago. The hue and cry going off to the\r\nHulks, and people coming thence to examine the iron, Joe\xe2\x80\x99s opinion\r\nwas corroborated. They did not undertake to say when it had left the\r\nprison-ships to which it undoubtedly had once belonged; but they claimed\r\nto know for certain that that particular manacle had not been worn by\r\neither of the two convicts who had escaped last night. Further, one of\r\nthose two was already retaken, and had not freed himself of his iron.\r\n\r\nKnowing what I knew, I set up an inference of my own here. I believed\r\nthe iron to be my convict\xe2\x80\x99s iron,--the iron I had seen and heard him\r\nfiling at, on the marshes,--but my mind did not accuse him of having put\r\nit to its latest use. For I believed one of two other persons to have\r\nbecome possessed of it, and to have turned it to this cruel account.\r\nEither Orlick, or the strange man who had shown me the file.\r\n\r\nNow, as to Orlick; he had gone to town exactly as he told us when we\r\npicked him up at the turnpike, he had been seen about town all the\r\nevening, he had been in divers companies in several public-houses, and\r\nhe had come back with myself and Mr. Wopsle. There was nothing against\r\nhim, save the quarrel; and my sister had quarrelled with him, and with\r\neverybody else about her, ten thousand times. As to the strange man; if\r\nhe had come back for his two bank-notes there could have been no dispute\r\nabout them, because my sister was fully prepared to restore them.\r\nBesides, there had been no altercation; the assailant had come in so\r\nsilently and suddenly, that she had been felled before she could look\r\nround.\r\n\r\nIt was horrible to think that I had provided the weapon, however\r\nundesignedly, but I could hardly think otherwise. I suffered unspeakable\r\ntrouble while I considered and reconsidered whether I should at last\r\ndissolve that spell of my childhood and tell Joe all the story. For\r\nmonths afterwards, I every day settled the question finally in the\r\nnegative, and reopened and reargued it next morning. The contention\r\ncame, after all, to this;--the secret was such an old one now, had so\r\ngrown into me and become a part of myself, that I could not tear it\r\naway. In addition to the dread that, having led up to so much mischief,\r\nit would be now more likely than ever to alienate Joe from me if he\r\nbelieved it, I had a further restraining dread that he would not believe\r\nit, but would assort it with the fabulous dogs and veal-cutlets as a\r\nmonstrous invention. However, I temporized with myself, of course--for,\r\nwas I not wavering between right and wrong, when the thing is always\r\ndone?--and resolved to make a full disclosure if I should see any\r\nsuch new occasion as a new chance of helping in the discovery of the\r\nassailant.\r\n\r\nThe Constables and the Bow Street men from London--for, this happened in\r\nthe days of the extinct red-waistcoated police--were about the house for\r\na week or two, and did pretty much what I have heard and read of like\r\nauthorities doing in other such cases. They took up several obviously\r\nwrong people, and they ran their heads very hard against wrong ideas,\r\nand persisted in trying to fit the circumstances to the ideas, instead\r\nof trying to extract ideas from the circumstances. Also, they stood\r\nabout the door of the Jolly Bargemen, with knowing and reserved looks\r\nthat filled the whole neighborhood with admiration; and they had a\r\nmysterious manner of taking their drink, that was almost as good as\r\ntaking the culprit. But not quite, for they never did it.\r\n\r\nLong after these constitutional powers had dispersed, my sister lay very\r\nill in bed. Her sight was disturbed, so that she saw objects multiplied,\r\nand grasped at visionary teacups and wineglasses instead of the\r\nrealities; her hearing was greatly impaired; her memory also; and her\r\nspeech was unintelligible. When, at last, she came round so far as to\r\nbe helped downstairs, it was still necessary to keep my slate always by\r\nher, that she might indicate in writing what she could not indicate in\r\nspeech. As she was (very bad handwriting apart) a more than indifferent\r\nspeller, and as Joe was a more than indifferent reader, extraordinary\r\ncomplications arose between them which I was always called in to solve.\r\nThe administration of mutton instead of medicine, the substitution of\r\nTea for Joe, and the baker for bacon, were among the mildest of my own\r\nmistakes.\r\n\r\nHowever, her temper was greatly improved, and she was patient. A\r\ntremulous uncertainty of the action of all her limbs soon became a\r\npart of her regular state, and afterwards, at intervals of two or three\r\nmonths, she would often put her hands to her head, and would then remain\r\nfor about a week at a time in some gloomy aberration of mind. We were\r\nat a loss to find a suitable attendant for her, until a circumstance\r\nhappened conveniently to relieve us. Mr. Wopsle\xe2\x80\x99s great-aunt conquered a\r\nconfirmed habit of living into which she had fallen, and Biddy became a\r\npart of our establishment.\r\n\r\nIt may have been about a month after my sister\xe2\x80\x99s reappearance in the\r\nkitchen, when Biddy came to us with a small speckled box containing the\r\nwhole of her worldly effects, and became a blessing to the household.\r\nAbove all, she was a blessing to Joe, for the dear old fellow was sadly\r\ncut up by the constant contemplation of the wreck of his wife, and had\r\nbeen accustomed, while attending on her of an evening, to turn to me\r\nevery now and then and say, with his blue eyes moistened, \xe2\x80\x9cSuch a fine\r\nfigure of a woman as she once were, Pip!\xe2\x80\x9d Biddy instantly taking the\r\ncleverest charge of her as though she had studied her from infancy; Joe\r\nbecame able in some sort to appreciate the greater quiet of his life,\r\nand to get down to the Jolly Bargemen now and then for a change that did\r\nhim good. It was characteristic of the police people that they had all\r\nmore or less suspected poor Joe (though he never knew it), and that they\r\nhad to a man concurred in regarding him as one of the deepest spirits\r\nthey had ever encountered.\r\n\r\nBiddy\xe2\x80\x99s first triumph in her new office, was to solve a difficulty\r\nthat had completely vanquished me. I had tried hard at it, but had made\r\nnothing of it. Thus it was:--\r\n\r\nAgain and again and again, my sister had traced upon the slate, a\r\ncharacter that looked like a curious T, and then with the utmost\r\neagerness had called our attention to it as something she particularly\r\nwanted. I had in vain tried everything producible that began with a T,\r\nfrom tar to toast and tub. At length it had come into my head that the\r\nsign looked like a hammer, and on my lustily calling that word in my\r\nsister\xe2\x80\x99s ear, she had begun to hammer on the table and had expressed a\r\nqualified assent. Thereupon, I had brought in all our hammers, one after\r\nanother, but without avail. Then I bethought me of a crutch, the shape\r\nbeing much the same, and I borrowed one in the village, and displayed\r\nit to my sister with considerable confidence. But she shook her head to\r\nthat extent when she was shown it, that we were terrified lest in her\r\nweak and shattered state she should dislocate her neck.\r\n\r\nWhen my sister found that Biddy was very quick to understand her, this\r\nmysterious sign reappeared on the slate. Biddy looked thoughtfully\r\nat it, heard my explanation, looked thoughtfully at my sister, looked\r\nthoughtfully at Joe (who was always represented on the slate by his\r\ninitial letter), and ran into the forge, followed by Joe and me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, of course!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Biddy, with an exultant face. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you see?\r\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s him!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOrlick, without a doubt! She had lost his name, and could only signify\r\nhim by his hammer. We told him why we wanted him to come into the\r\nkitchen, and he slowly laid down his hammer, wiped his brow with his\r\narm, took another wipe at it with his apron, and came slouching\r\nout, with a curious loose vagabond bend in the knees that strongly\r\ndistinguished him.\r\n\r\nI confess that I expected to see my sister denounce him, and that I\r\nwas disappointed by the different result. She manifested the greatest\r\nanxiety to be on good terms with him, was evidently much pleased by his\r\nbeing at length produced, and motioned that she would have him\r\ngiven something to drink. She watched his countenance as if she were\r\nparticularly wishful to be assured that he took kindly to his reception,\r\nshe showed every possible desire to conciliate him, and there was an air\r\nof humble propitiation in all she did, such as I have seen pervade the\r\nbearing of a child towards a hard master. After that day, a day rarely\r\npassed without her drawing the hammer on her slate, and without Orlick\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nslouching in and standing doggedly before her, as if he knew no more\r\nthan I did what to make of it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XVII\r\n\r\nI now fell into a regular routine of apprenticeship life, which was\r\nvaried beyond the limits of the village and the marshes, by no more\r\nremarkable circumstance than the arrival of my birthday and my paying\r\nanother visit to Miss Havisham. I found Miss Sarah Pocket still on duty\r\nat the gate; I found Miss Havisham just as I had left her, and she spoke\r\nof Estella in the very same way, if not in the very same words. The\r\ninterview lasted but a few minutes, and she gave me a guinea when I was\r\ngoing, and told me to come again on my next birthday. I may mention at\r\nonce that this became an annual custom. I tried to decline taking the\r\nguinea on the first occasion, but with no better effect than causing her\r\nto ask me very angrily, if I expected more? Then, and after that, I took\r\nit.\r\n\r\nSo unchanging was the dull old house, the yellow light in the darkened\r\nroom, the faded spectre in the chair by the dressing-table glass, that\r\nI felt as if the stopping of the clocks had stopped Time in that\r\nmysterious place, and, while I and everything else outside it grew\r\nolder, it stood still. Daylight never entered the house as to my\r\nthoughts and remembrances of it, any more than as to the actual fact. It\r\nbewildered me, and under its influence I continued at heart to hate my\r\ntrade and to be ashamed of home.\r\n\r\nImperceptibly I became conscious of a change in Biddy, however. Her\r\nshoes came up at the heel, her hair grew bright and neat, her hands were\r\nalways clean. She was not beautiful,--she was common, and could not be\r\nlike Estella,--but she was pleasant and wholesome and sweet-tempered.\r\nShe had not been with us more than a year (I remember her being newly\r\nout of mourning at the time it struck me), when I observed to myself one\r\nevening that she had curiously thoughtful and attentive eyes; eyes that\r\nwere very pretty and very good.\r\n\r\nIt came of my lifting up my own eyes from a task I was poring\r\nat--writing some passages from a book, to improve myself in two ways at\r\nonce by a sort of stratagem--and seeing Biddy observant of what I was\r\nabout. I laid down my pen, and Biddy stopped in her needlework without\r\nlaying it down.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBiddy,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9chow do you manage it? Either I am very stupid, or you\r\nare very clever.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it that I manage? I don\xe2\x80\x99t know,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Biddy, smiling.\r\n\r\nShe managed our whole domestic life, and wonderfully too; but I did not\r\nmean that, though that made what I did mean more surprising.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do you manage, Biddy,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cto learn everything that I learn,\r\nand always to keep up with me?\xe2\x80\x9d I was beginning to be rather vain of\r\nmy knowledge, for I spent my birthday guineas on it, and set aside the\r\ngreater part of my pocket-money for similar investment; though I have no\r\ndoubt, now, that the little I knew was extremely dear at the price.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI might as well ask you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Biddy, \xe2\x80\x9chow you manage?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; because when I come in from the forge of a night, any one can see\r\nme turning to at it. But you never turn to at it, Biddy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose I must catch it like a cough,\xe2\x80\x9d said Biddy, quietly; and went\r\non with her sewing.\r\n\r\nPursuing my idea as I leaned back in my wooden chair, and looked at\r\nBiddy sewing away with her head on one side, I began to think her rather\r\nan extraordinary girl. For I called to mind now, that she was equally\r\naccomplished in the terms of our trade, and the names of our different\r\nsorts of work, and our various tools. In short, whatever I knew, Biddy\r\nknew. Theoretically, she was already as good a blacksmith as I, or\r\nbetter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are one of those, Biddy,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cwho make the most of every\r\nchance. You never had a chance before you came here, and see how\r\nimproved you are!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBiddy looked at me for an instant, and went on with her sewing. \xe2\x80\x9cI was\r\nyour first teacher though; wasn\xe2\x80\x99t I?\xe2\x80\x9d said she, as she sewed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBiddy!\xe2\x80\x9d I exclaimed, in amazement. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, you are crying!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo I am not,\xe2\x80\x9d said Biddy, looking up and laughing. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat put that in\r\nyour head?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhat could have put it in my head but the glistening of a tear as it\r\ndropped on her work? I sat silent, recalling what a drudge she had been\r\nuntil Mr. Wopsle\xe2\x80\x99s great-aunt successfully overcame that bad habit of\r\nliving, so highly desirable to be got rid of by some people. I recalled\r\nthe hopeless circumstances by which she had been surrounded in the\r\nmiserable little shop and the miserable little noisy evening school,\r\nwith that miserable old bundle of incompetence always to be dragged and\r\nshouldered. I reflected that even in those untoward times there must\r\nhave been latent in Biddy what was now developing, for, in my first\r\nuneasiness and discontent I had turned to her for help, as a matter of\r\ncourse. Biddy sat quietly sewing, shedding no more tears, and while I\r\nlooked at her and thought about it all, it occurred to me that perhaps\r\nI had not been sufficiently grateful to Biddy. I might have been too\r\nreserved, and should have patronized her more (though I did not use that\r\nprecise word in my meditations) with my confidence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Biddy,\xe2\x80\x9d I observed, when I had done turning it over, \xe2\x80\x9cyou were my\r\nfirst teacher, and that at a time when we little thought of ever being\r\ntogether like this, in this kitchen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, poor thing!\xe2\x80\x9d replied Biddy. It was like her self-forgetfulness to\r\ntransfer the remark to my sister, and to get up and be busy about her,\r\nmaking her more comfortable; \xe2\x80\x9cthat\xe2\x80\x99s sadly true!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell!\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cwe must talk together a little more, as we used to do.\r\nAnd I must consult you a little more, as I used to do. Let us have a\r\nquiet walk on the marshes next Sunday, Biddy, and a long chat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMy sister was never left alone now; but Joe more than readily undertook\r\nthe care of her on that Sunday afternoon, and Biddy and I went out\r\ntogether. It was summer-time, and lovely weather. When we had passed the\r\nvillage and the church and the churchyard, and were out on the marshes\r\nand began to see the sails of the ships as they sailed on, I began to\r\ncombine Miss Havisham and Estella with the prospect, in my usual way.\r\nWhen we came to the river-side and sat down on the bank, with the water\r\nrippling at our feet, making it all more quiet than it would have been\r\nwithout that sound, I resolved that it was a good time and place for the\r\nadmission of Biddy into my inner confidence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBiddy,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, after binding her to secrecy, \xe2\x80\x9cI want to be a\r\ngentleman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t, if I was you!\xe2\x80\x9d she returned. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think it would\r\nanswer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBiddy,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, with some severity, \xe2\x80\x9cI have particular reasons for\r\nwanting to be a gentleman.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know best, Pip; but don\xe2\x80\x99t you think you are happier as you are?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBiddy,\xe2\x80\x9d I exclaimed, impatiently, \xe2\x80\x9cI am not at all happy as I am. I\r\nam disgusted with my calling and with my life. I have never taken to\r\neither, since I was bound. Don\xe2\x80\x99t be absurd.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWas I absurd?\xe2\x80\x9d said Biddy, quietly raising her eyebrows; \xe2\x80\x9cI am sorry\r\nfor that; I didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean to be. I only want you to do well, and to be\r\ncomfortable.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, understand once for all that I never shall or can be\r\ncomfortable--or anything but miserable--there, Biddy!--unless I can lead\r\na very different sort of life from the life I lead now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s a pity!\xe2\x80\x9d said Biddy, shaking her head with a sorrowful air.\r\n\r\nNow, I too had so often thought it a pity, that, in the singular kind of\r\nquarrel with myself which I was always carrying on, I was half inclined\r\nto shed tears of vexation and distress when Biddy gave utterance to her\r\nsentiment and my own. I told her she was right, and I knew it was much\r\nto be regretted, but still it was not to be helped.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I could have settled down,\xe2\x80\x9d I said to Biddy, plucking up the short\r\ngrass within reach, much as I had once upon a time pulled my feelings\r\nout of my hair and kicked them into the brewery wall,--\xe2\x80\x9cif I could have\r\nsettled down and been but half as fond of the forge as I was when I was\r\nlittle, I know it would have been much better for me. You and I and Joe\r\nwould have wanted nothing then, and Joe and I would perhaps have gone\r\npartners when I was out of my time, and I might even have grown up to\r\nkeep company with you, and we might have sat on this very bank on a fine\r\nSunday, quite different people. I should have been good enough for you;\r\nshouldn\xe2\x80\x99t I, Biddy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBiddy sighed as she looked at the ships sailing on, and returned for\r\nanswer, \xe2\x80\x9cYes; I am not over-particular.\xe2\x80\x9d It scarcely sounded flattering,\r\nbut I knew she meant well.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cInstead of that,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, plucking up more grass and chewing a blade or\r\ntwo, \xe2\x80\x9csee how I am going on. Dissatisfied, and uncomfortable, and--what\r\nwould it signify to me, being coarse and common, if nobody had told me\r\nso!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBiddy turned her face suddenly towards mine, and looked far more\r\nattentively at me than she had looked at the sailing ships.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was neither a very true nor a very polite thing to say,\xe2\x80\x9d she\r\nremarked, directing her eyes to the ships again. \xe2\x80\x9cWho said it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI was disconcerted, for I had broken away without quite seeing where\r\nI was going to. It was not to be shuffled off now, however, and I\r\nanswered, \xe2\x80\x9cThe beautiful young lady at Miss Havisham\xe2\x80\x99s, and she\xe2\x80\x99s more\r\nbeautiful than anybody ever was, and I admire her dreadfully, and I want\r\nto be a gentleman on her account.\xe2\x80\x9d Having made this lunatic confession,\r\nI began to throw my torn-up grass into the river, as if I had some\r\nthoughts of following it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you want to be a gentleman, to spite her or to gain her over?\xe2\x80\x9d Biddy\r\nquietly asked me, after a pause.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know,\xe2\x80\x9d I moodily answered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause, if it is to spite her,\xe2\x80\x9d Biddy pursued, \xe2\x80\x9cI should think--but\r\nyou know best--that might be better and more independently done by\r\ncaring nothing for her words. And if it is to gain her over, I should\r\nthink--but you know best--she was not worth gaining over.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nExactly what I myself had thought, many times. Exactly what was\r\nperfectly manifest to me at the moment. But how could I, a poor dazed\r\nvillage lad, avoid that wonderful inconsistency into which the best and\r\nwisest of men fall every day?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt may be all quite true,\xe2\x80\x9d said I to Biddy, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I admire her\r\ndreadfully.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn short, I turned over on my face when I came to that, and got a good\r\ngrasp on the hair on each side of my head, and wrenched it well. All the\r\nwhile knowing the madness of my heart to be so very mad and misplaced,\r\nthat I was quite conscious it would have served my face right, if I\r\nhad lifted it up by my hair, and knocked it against the pebbles as a\r\npunishment for belonging to such an idiot.\r\n\r\nBiddy was the wisest of girls, and she tried to reason no more with me.\r\nShe put her hand, which was a comfortable hand though roughened by work,\r\nupon my hands, one after another, and gently took them out of my hair.\r\nThen she softly patted my shoulder in a soothing way, while with my face\r\nupon my sleeve I cried a little,--exactly as I had done in the brewery\r\nyard,--and felt vaguely convinced that I was very much ill-used by\r\nsomebody, or by everybody; I can\xe2\x80\x99t say which.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am glad of one thing,\xe2\x80\x9d said Biddy, \xe2\x80\x9cand that is, that you have felt\r\nyou could give me your confidence, Pip. And I am glad of another thing,\r\nand that is, that of course you know you may depend upon my keeping it\r\nand always so far deserving it. If your first teacher (dear! such a poor\r\none, and so much in need of being taught herself!) had been your teacher\r\nat the present time, she thinks she knows what lesson she would set. But\r\nit would be a hard one to learn, and you have got beyond her, and it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nof no use now.\xe2\x80\x9d So, with a quiet sigh for me, Biddy rose from the bank,\r\nand said, with a fresh and pleasant change of voice, \xe2\x80\x9cShall we walk a\r\nlittle farther, or go home?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBiddy,\xe2\x80\x9d I cried, getting up, putting my arm round her neck, and giving\r\nher a kiss, \xe2\x80\x9cI shall always tell you everything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTill you\xe2\x80\x99re a gentleman,\xe2\x80\x9d said Biddy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know I never shall be, so that\xe2\x80\x99s always. Not that I have any\r\noccasion to tell you anything, for you know everything I know,--as I\r\ntold you at home the other night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d said Biddy, quite in a whisper, as she looked away at the ships.\r\nAnd then repeated, with her former pleasant change, \xe2\x80\x9cshall we walk a\r\nlittle farther, or go home?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI said to Biddy we would walk a little farther, and we did so, and the\r\nsummer afternoon toned down into the summer evening, and it was very\r\nbeautiful. I began to consider whether I was not more naturally and\r\nwholesomely situated, after all, in these circumstances, than playing\r\nbeggar my neighbor by candle-light in the room with the stopped clocks,\r\nand being despised by Estella. I thought it would be very good for me if\r\nI could get her out of my head, with all the rest of those remembrances\r\nand fancies, and could go to work determined to relish what I had to do,\r\nand stick to it, and make the best of it. I asked myself the question\r\nwhether I did not surely know that if Estella were beside me at that\r\nmoment instead of Biddy, she would make me miserable? I was obliged to\r\nadmit that I did know it for a certainty, and I said to myself, \xe2\x80\x9cPip,\r\nwhat a fool you are!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe talked a good deal as we walked, and all that Biddy said seemed\r\nright. Biddy was never insulting, or capricious, or Biddy to-day and\r\nsomebody else to-morrow; she would have derived only pain, and no\r\npleasure, from giving me pain; she would far rather have wounded her own\r\nbreast than mine. How could it be, then, that I did not like her much\r\nthe better of the two?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBiddy,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, when we were walking homeward, \xe2\x80\x9cI wish you could put me\r\nright.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish I could!\xe2\x80\x9d said Biddy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I could only get myself to fall in love with you,--you don\xe2\x80\x99t mind my\r\nspeaking so openly to such an old acquaintance?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh dear, not at all!\xe2\x80\x9d said Biddy. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t mind me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I could only get myself to do it, that would be the thing for me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you never will, you see,\xe2\x80\x9d said Biddy.\r\n\r\nIt did not appear quite so unlikely to me that evening, as it would have\r\ndone if we had discussed it a few hours before. I therefore observed\r\nI was not quite sure of that. But Biddy said she was, and she said it\r\ndecisively. In my heart I believed her to be right; and yet I took it\r\nrather ill, too, that she should be so positive on the point.\r\n\r\nWhen we came near the churchyard, we had to cross an embankment, and\r\nget over a stile near a sluice-gate. There started up, from the gate, or\r\nfrom the rushes, or from the ooze (which was quite in his stagnant way),\r\nOld Orlick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHalloa!\xe2\x80\x9d he growled, \xe2\x80\x9cwhere are you two going?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere should we be going, but home?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m jiggered if I don\xe2\x80\x99t see you home!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis penalty of being jiggered was a favorite supposititious case of\r\nhis. He attached no definite meaning to the word that I am aware of, but\r\nused it, like his own pretended Christian name, to affront mankind, and\r\nconvey an idea of something savagely damaging. When I was younger, I\r\nhad had a general belief that if he had jiggered me personally, he would\r\nhave done it with a sharp and twisted hook.\r\n\r\nBiddy was much against his going with us, and said to me in a whisper,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t let him come; I don\xe2\x80\x99t like him.\xe2\x80\x9d As I did not like him either,\r\nI took the liberty of saying that we thanked him, but we didn\xe2\x80\x99t want\r\nseeing home. He received that piece of information with a yell of\r\nlaughter, and dropped back, but came slouching after us at a little\r\ndistance.\r\n\r\nCurious to know whether Biddy suspected him of having had a hand in\r\nthat murderous attack of which my sister had never been able to give any\r\naccount, I asked her why she did not like him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d she replied, glancing over her shoulder as he slouched after us,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cbecause I--I am afraid he likes me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid he ever tell you he liked you?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked indignantly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Biddy, glancing over her shoulder again, \xe2\x80\x9che never told me\r\nso; but he dances at me, whenever he can catch my eye.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHowever novel and peculiar this testimony of attachment, I did not\r\ndoubt the accuracy of the interpretation. I was very hot indeed upon\r\nOld Orlick\xe2\x80\x99s daring to admire her; as hot as if it were an outrage on\r\nmyself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut it makes no difference to you, you know,\xe2\x80\x9d said Biddy, calmly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Biddy, it makes no difference to me; only I don\xe2\x80\x99t like it; I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\napprove of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNor I neither,\xe2\x80\x9d said Biddy. \xe2\x80\x9cThough that makes no difference to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cExactly,\xe2\x80\x9d said I; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I must tell you I should have no opinion of you,\r\nBiddy, if he danced at you with your own consent.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI kept an eye on Orlick after that night, and, whenever circumstances\r\nwere favorable to his dancing at Biddy, got before him to obscure that\r\ndemonstration. He had struck root in Joe\xe2\x80\x99s establishment, by reason\r\nof my sister\xe2\x80\x99s sudden fancy for him, or I should have tried to get him\r\ndismissed. He quite understood and reciprocated my good intentions, as I\r\nhad reason to know thereafter.\r\n\r\nAnd now, because my mind was not confused enough before, I complicated\r\nits confusion fifty thousand-fold, by having states and seasons when I\r\nwas clear that Biddy was immeasurably better than Estella, and that the\r\nplain honest working life to which I was born had nothing in it to\r\nbe ashamed of, but offered me sufficient means of self-respect\r\nand happiness. At those times, I would decide conclusively that my\r\ndisaffection to dear old Joe and the forge was gone, and that I was\r\ngrowing up in a fair way to be partners with Joe and to keep company\r\nwith Biddy,--when all in a moment some confounding remembrance of the\r\nHavisham days would fall upon me like a destructive missile, and scatter\r\nmy wits again. Scattered wits take a long time picking up; and often\r\nbefore I had got them well together, they would be dispersed in all\r\ndirections by one stray thought, that perhaps after all Miss Havisham\r\nwas going to make my fortune when my time was out.\r\n\r\nIf my time had run out, it would have left me still at the height of my\r\nperplexities, I dare say. It never did run out, however, but was brought\r\nto a premature end, as I proceed to relate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XVIII\r\n\r\nIt was in the fourth year of my apprenticeship to Joe, and it was a\r\nSaturday night. There was a group assembled round the fire at the Three\r\nJolly Bargemen, attentive to Mr. Wopsle as he read the newspaper aloud.\r\nOf that group I was one.\r\n\r\nA highly popular murder had been committed, and Mr. Wopsle was imbrued\r\nin blood to the eyebrows. He gloated over every abhorrent adjective\r\nin the description, and identified himself with every witness at the\r\nInquest. He faintly moaned, \xe2\x80\x9cI am done for,\xe2\x80\x9d as the victim, and he\r\nbarbarously bellowed, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll serve you out,\xe2\x80\x9d as the murderer. He gave the\r\nmedical testimony, in pointed imitation of our local practitioner; and\r\nhe piped and shook, as the aged turnpike-keeper who had heard blows, to\r\nan extent so very paralytic as to suggest a doubt regarding the mental\r\ncompetency of that witness. The coroner, in Mr. Wopsle\xe2\x80\x99s hands, became\r\nTimon of Athens; the beadle, Coriolanus. He enjoyed himself thoroughly,\r\nand we all enjoyed ourselves, and were delightfully comfortable. In this\r\ncosey state of mind we came to the verdict Wilful Murder.\r\n\r\nThen, and not sooner, I became aware of a strange gentleman leaning over\r\nthe back of the settle opposite me, looking on. There was an expression\r\nof contempt on his face, and he bit the side of a great forefinger as he\r\nwatched the group of faces.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell!\xe2\x80\x9d said the stranger to Mr. Wopsle, when the reading was done, \xe2\x80\x9cyou\r\nhave settled it all to your own satisfaction, I have no doubt?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEverybody started and looked up, as if it were the murderer. He looked\r\nat everybody coldly and sarcastically.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGuilty, of course?\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cOut with it. Come!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSir,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Mr. Wopsle, \xe2\x80\x9cwithout having the honor of your\r\nacquaintance, I do say Guilty.\xe2\x80\x9d Upon this we all took courage to unite\r\nin a confirmatory murmur.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know you do,\xe2\x80\x9d said the stranger; \xe2\x80\x9cI knew you would. I told you so.\r\nBut now I\xe2\x80\x99ll ask you a question. Do you know, or do you not know,\r\nthat the law of England supposes every man to be innocent, until he is\r\nproved--proved--to be guilty?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSir,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Wopsle began to reply, \xe2\x80\x9cas an Englishman myself, I--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome!\xe2\x80\x9d said the stranger, biting his forefinger at him. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t evade\r\nthe question. Either you know it, or you don\xe2\x80\x99t know it. Which is it to\r\nbe?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe stood with his head on one side and himself on one side, in a\r\nbullying, interrogative manner, and he threw his forefinger at Mr.\r\nWopsle,--as it were to mark him out--before biting it again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow!\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you know it, or don\xe2\x80\x99t you know it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly I know it,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mr. Wopsle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly you know it. Then why didn\xe2\x80\x99t you say so at first? Now, I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nask you another question,\xe2\x80\x9d--taking possession of Mr. Wopsle, as if he\r\nhad a right to him,--\xe2\x80\x9cdo you know that none of these witnesses have yet\r\nbeen cross-examined?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Wopsle was beginning, \xe2\x80\x9cI can only say--\xe2\x80\x9d when the stranger stopped\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat? You won\xe2\x80\x99t answer the question, yes or no? Now, I\xe2\x80\x99ll try you\r\nagain.\xe2\x80\x9d Throwing his finger at him again. \xe2\x80\x9cAttend to me. Are you\r\naware, or are you not aware, that none of these witnesses have yet been\r\ncross-examined? Come, I only want one word from you. Yes, or no?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Wopsle hesitated, and we all began to conceive rather a poor opinion\r\nof him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome!\xe2\x80\x9d said the stranger, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll help you. You don\xe2\x80\x99t deserve help, but\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll help you. Look at that paper you hold in your hand. What is it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it?\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Mr. Wopsle, eyeing it, much at a loss.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued the stranger in his most sarcastic and suspicious\r\nmanner, \xe2\x80\x9cthe printed paper you have just been reading from?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUndoubtedly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUndoubtedly. Now, turn to that paper, and tell me whether it distinctly\r\nstates that the prisoner expressly said that his legal advisers\r\ninstructed him altogether to reserve his defence?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI read that just now,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Wopsle pleaded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind what you read just now, sir; I don\xe2\x80\x99t ask you what you read\r\njust now. You may read the Lord\xe2\x80\x99s Prayer backwards, if you like,--and,\r\nperhaps, have done it before to-day. Turn to the paper. No, no, no my\r\nfriend; not to the top of the column; you know better than that; to\r\nthe bottom, to the bottom.\xe2\x80\x9d (We all began to think Mr. Wopsle full of\r\nsubterfuge.) \xe2\x80\x9cWell? Have you found it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere it is,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Wopsle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, follow that passage with your eye, and tell me whether it\r\ndistinctly states that the prisoner expressly said that he was\r\ninstructed by his legal advisers wholly to reserve his defence? Come! Do\r\nyou make that of it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Wopsle answered, \xe2\x80\x9cThose are not the exact words.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot the exact words!\xe2\x80\x9d repeated the gentleman bitterly. \xe2\x80\x9cIs that the\r\nexact substance?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Wopsle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d repeated the stranger, looking round at the rest of the company\r\nwith his right hand extended towards the witness, Wopsle. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd now I ask\r\nyou what you say to the conscience of that man who, with that passage\r\nbefore his eyes, can lay his head upon his pillow after having\r\npronounced a fellow-creature guilty, unheard?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe all began to suspect that Mr. Wopsle was not the man we had thought\r\nhim, and that he was beginning to be found out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd that same man, remember,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued the gentleman, throwing his\r\nfinger at Mr. Wopsle heavily,--\xe2\x80\x9cthat same man might be summoned as a\r\njuryman upon this very trial, and, having thus deeply committed himself,\r\nmight return to the bosom of his family and lay his head upon his\r\npillow, after deliberately swearing that he would well and truly try the\r\nissue joined between Our Sovereign Lord the King and the prisoner at the\r\nbar, and would a true verdict give according to the evidence, so help\r\nhim God!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe were all deeply persuaded that the unfortunate Wopsle had gone too\r\nfar, and had better stop in his reckless career while there was yet\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nThe strange gentleman, with an air of authority not to be disputed, and\r\nwith a manner expressive of knowing something secret about every one of\r\nus that would effectually do for each individual if he chose to disclose\r\nit, left the back of the settle, and came into the space between the two\r\nsettles, in front of the fire, where he remained standing, his left hand\r\nin his pocket, and he biting the forefinger of his right.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFrom information I have received,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, looking round at us as we\r\nall quailed before him, \xe2\x80\x9cI have reason to believe there is a blacksmith\r\namong you, by name Joseph--or Joe--Gargery. Which is the man?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere is the man,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe.\r\n\r\nThe strange gentleman beckoned him out of his place, and Joe went.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have an apprentice,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued the stranger, \xe2\x80\x9ccommonly known as Pip?\r\nIs he here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am here!\xe2\x80\x9d I cried.\r\n\r\nThe stranger did not recognize me, but I recognized him as the gentleman\r\nI had met on the stairs, on the occasion of my second visit to Miss\r\nHavisham. I had known him the moment I saw him looking over the settle,\r\nand now that I stood confronting him with his hand upon my shoulder,\r\nI checked off again in detail his large head, his dark complexion, his\r\ndeep-set eyes, his bushy black eyebrows, his large watch-chain, his\r\nstrong black dots of beard and whisker, and even the smell of scented\r\nsoap on his great hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish to have a private conference with you two,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, when he had\r\nsurveyed me at his leisure. \xe2\x80\x9cIt will take a little time. Perhaps we\r\nhad better go to your place of residence. I prefer not to anticipate my\r\ncommunication here; you will impart as much or as little of it as you\r\nplease to your friends afterwards; I have nothing to do with that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAmidst a wondering silence, we three walked out of the Jolly Bargemen,\r\nand in a wondering silence walked home. While going along, the strange\r\ngentleman occasionally looked at me, and occasionally bit the side of\r\nhis finger. As we neared home, Joe vaguely acknowledging the occasion as\r\nan impressive and ceremonious one, went on ahead to open the front door.\r\nOur conference was held in the state parlor, which was feebly lighted by\r\none candle.\r\n\r\nIt began with the strange gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s sitting down at the table, drawing\r\nthe candle to him, and looking over some entries in his pocket-book.\r\nHe then put up the pocket-book and set the candle a little aside, after\r\npeering round it into the darkness at Joe and me, to ascertain which was\r\nwhich.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy name,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cis Jaggers, and I am a lawyer in London. I am\r\npretty well known. I have unusual business to transact with you, and I\r\ncommence by explaining that it is not of my originating. If my advice\r\nhad been asked, I should not have been here. It was not asked, and you\r\nsee me here. What I have to do as the confidential agent of another, I\r\ndo. No less, no more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFinding that he could not see us very well from where he sat, he got\r\nup, and threw one leg over the back of a chair and leaned upon it; thus\r\nhaving one foot on the seat of the chair, and one foot on the ground.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, Joseph Gargery, I am the bearer of an offer to relieve you of\r\nthis young fellow your apprentice. You would not object to cancel his\r\nindentures at his request and for his good? You would want nothing for\r\nso doing?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLord forbid that I should want anything for not standing in Pip\xe2\x80\x99s way,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n said Joe, staring.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLord forbidding is pious, but not to the purpose,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Mr.\r\nJaggers. \xe2\x80\x9cThe question is, Would you want anything? Do you want\r\nanything?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe answer is,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Joe, sternly, \xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI thought Mr. Jaggers glanced at Joe, as if he considered him a fool for\r\nhis disinterestedness. But I was too much bewildered between breathless\r\ncuriosity and surprise, to be sure of it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Jaggers. \xe2\x80\x9cRecollect the admission you have made,\r\nand don\xe2\x80\x99t try to go from it presently.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho\xe2\x80\x99s a going to try?\xe2\x80\x9d retorted Joe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t say anybody is. Do you keep a dog?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I do keep a dog.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBear in mind then, that Brag is a good dog, but Holdfast is a better.\r\nBear that in mind, will you?\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Mr. Jaggers, shutting his eyes\r\nand nodding his head at Joe, as if he were forgiving him something.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, I return to this young fellow. And the communication I have got to\r\nmake is, that he has great expectations.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJoe and I gasped, and looked at one another.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am instructed to communicate to him,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Jaggers, throwing\r\nhis finger at me sideways, \xe2\x80\x9cthat he will come into a handsome property.\r\nFurther, that it is the desire of the present possessor of that\r\nproperty, that he be immediately removed from his present sphere of life\r\nand from this place, and be brought up as a gentleman,--in a word, as a\r\nyoung fellow of great expectations.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMy dream was out; my wild fancy was surpassed by sober reality; Miss\r\nHavisham was going to make my fortune on a grand scale.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, Mr. Pip,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued the lawyer, \xe2\x80\x9cI address the rest of what I have\r\nto say, to you. You are to understand, first, that it is the request\r\nof the person from whom I take my instructions that you always bear\r\nthe name of Pip. You will have no objection, I dare say, to your great\r\nexpectations being encumbered with that easy condition. But if you have\r\nany objection, this is the time to mention it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMy heart was beating so fast, and there was such a singing in my ears,\r\nthat I could scarcely stammer I had no objection.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should think not! Now you are to understand, secondly, Mr. Pip, that\r\nthe name of the person who is your liberal benefactor remains a profound\r\nsecret, until the person chooses to reveal it. I am empowered to mention\r\nthat it is the intention of the person to reveal it at first hand by\r\nword of mouth to yourself. When or where that intention may be carried\r\nout, I cannot say; no one can say. It may be years hence. Now, you are\r\ndistinctly to understand that you are most positively prohibited from\r\nmaking any inquiry on this head, or any allusion or reference, however\r\ndistant, to any individual whomsoever as the individual, in all the\r\ncommunications you may have with me. If you have a suspicion in your own\r\nbreast, keep that suspicion in your own breast. It is not the least to\r\nthe purpose what the reasons of this prohibition are; they may be the\r\nstrongest and gravest reasons, or they may be mere whim. This is not for\r\nyou to inquire into. The condition is laid down. Your acceptance of it,\r\nand your observance of it as binding, is the only remaining condition\r\nthat I am charged with, by the person from whom I take my instructions,\r\nand for whom I am not otherwise responsible. That person is the person\r\nfrom whom you derive your expectations, and the secret is solely held by\r\nthat person and by me. Again, not a very difficult condition with which\r\nto encumber such a rise in fortune; but if you have any objection to it,\r\nthis is the time to mention it. Speak out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOnce more, I stammered with difficulty that I had no objection.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should think not! Now, Mr. Pip, I have done with stipulations.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n Though he called me Mr. Pip, and began rather to make up to me, he still\r\ncould not get rid of a certain air of bullying suspicion; and even now\r\nhe occasionally shut his eyes and threw his finger at me while he\r\nspoke, as much as to express that he knew all kinds of things to my\r\ndisparagement, if he only chose to mention them. \xe2\x80\x9cWe come next, to mere\r\ndetails of arrangement. You must know that, although I have used\r\nthe term \xe2\x80\x98expectations\xe2\x80\x99 more than once, you are not endowed with\r\nexpectations only. There is already lodged in my hands a sum of money\r\namply sufficient for your suitable education and maintenance. You will\r\nplease consider me your guardian. Oh!\xe2\x80\x9d for I was going to thank him, \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\ntell you at once, I am paid for my services, or I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t render them.\r\nIt is considered that you must be better educated, in accordance with\r\nyour altered position, and that you will be alive to the importance and\r\nnecessity of at once entering on that advantage.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI said I had always longed for it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind what you have always longed for, Mr. Pip,\xe2\x80\x9d he retorted;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9ckeep to the record. If you long for it now, that\xe2\x80\x99s enough. Am I\r\nanswered that you are ready to be placed at once under some proper\r\ntutor? Is that it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI stammered yes, that was it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood. Now, your inclinations are to be consulted. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that\r\nwise, mind, but it\xe2\x80\x99s my trust. Have you ever heard of any tutor whom you\r\nwould prefer to another?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI had never heard of any tutor but Biddy and Mr. Wopsle\xe2\x80\x99s great-aunt;\r\nso, I replied in the negative.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is a certain tutor, of whom I have some knowledge, who I think\r\nmight suit the purpose,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Jaggers. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t recommend him,\r\nobserve; because I never recommend anybody. The gentleman I speak of is\r\none Mr. Matthew Pocket.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAh! I caught at the name directly. Miss Havisham\xe2\x80\x99s relation. The Matthew\r\nwhom Mr. and Mrs. Camilla had spoken of. The Matthew whose place was to\r\nbe at Miss Havisham\xe2\x80\x99s head, when she lay dead, in her bride\xe2\x80\x99s dress on\r\nthe bride\xe2\x80\x99s table.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know the name?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Jaggers, looking shrewdly at me, and then\r\nshutting up his eyes while he waited for my answer.\r\n\r\nMy answer was, that I had heard of the name.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cYou have heard of the name. But the question is, what do\r\nyou say of it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI said, or tried to say, that I was much obliged to him for his\r\nrecommendation--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, my young friend!\xe2\x80\x9d he interrupted, shaking his great head very\r\nslowly. \xe2\x80\x9cRecollect yourself!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNot recollecting myself, I began again that I was much obliged to him\r\nfor his recommendation--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, my young friend,\xe2\x80\x9d he interrupted, shaking his head and frowning and\r\nsmiling both at once,--\xe2\x80\x9cno, no, no; it\xe2\x80\x99s very well done, but it won\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ndo; you are too young to fix me with it. Recommendation is not the word,\r\nMr. Pip. Try another.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCorrecting myself, I said that I was much obliged to him for his mention\r\nof Mr. Matthew Pocket--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s more like it!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mr. Jaggers.--And (I added), I would\r\ngladly try that gentleman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood. You had better try him in his own house. The way shall be\r\nprepared for you, and you can see his son first, who is in London. When\r\nwill you come to London?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI said (glancing at Joe, who stood looking on, motionless), that I\r\nsupposed I could come directly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFirst,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Jaggers, \xe2\x80\x9cyou should have some new clothes to come in,\r\nand they should not be working-clothes. Say this day week. You\xe2\x80\x99ll want\r\nsome money. Shall I leave you twenty guineas?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe produced a long purse, with the greatest coolness, and counted them\r\nout on the table and pushed them over to me. This was the first time he\r\nhad taken his leg from the chair. He sat astride of the chair when he\r\nhad pushed the money over, and sat swinging his purse and eyeing Joe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Joseph Gargery? You look dumbfoundered?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am!\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe, in a very decided manner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was understood that you wanted nothing for yourself, remember?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt were understood,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd it are understood. And it ever will\r\nbe similar according.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut what,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Jaggers, swinging his purse,--\xe2\x80\x9cwhat if it was in my\r\ninstructions to make you a present, as compensation?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs compensation what for?\xe2\x80\x9d Joe demanded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor the loss of his services.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJoe laid his hand upon my shoulder with the touch of a woman. I have\r\noften thought him since, like the steam-hammer that can crush a man or\r\npat an egg-shell, in his combination of strength with gentleness. \xe2\x80\x9cPip\r\nis that hearty welcome,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe, \xe2\x80\x9cto go free with his services, to\r\nhonor and fortun\xe2\x80\x99, as no words can tell him. But if you think as Money\r\ncan make compensation to me for the loss of the little child--what come\r\nto the forge--and ever the best of friends!--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nO dear good Joe, whom I was so ready to leave and so unthankful to, I\r\nsee you again, with your muscular blacksmith\xe2\x80\x99s arm before your eyes,\r\nand your broad chest heaving, and your voice dying away. O dear good\r\nfaithful tender Joe, I feel the loving tremble of your hand upon my arm,\r\nas solemnly this day as if it had been the rustle of an angel\xe2\x80\x99s wing!\r\n\r\nBut I encouraged Joe at the time. I was lost in the mazes of my future\r\nfortunes, and could not retrace the by-paths we had trodden together. I\r\nbegged Joe to be comforted, for (as he said) we had ever been the best\r\nof friends, and (as I said) we ever would be so. Joe scooped his eyes\r\nwith his disengaged wrist, as if he were bent on gouging himself, but\r\nsaid not another word.\r\n\r\nMr. Jaggers had looked on at this, as one who recognized in Joe the\r\nvillage idiot, and in me his keeper. When it was over, he said, weighing\r\nin his hand the purse he had ceased to swing:--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, Joseph Gargery, I warn you this is your last chance. No half\r\nmeasures with me. If you mean to take a present that I have it in charge\r\nto make you, speak out, and you shall have it. If on the contrary you\r\nmean to say--\xe2\x80\x9d Here, to his great amazement, he was stopped by Joe\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsuddenly working round him with every demonstration of a fell pugilistic\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhich I meantersay,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Joe, \xe2\x80\x9cthat if you come into my place\r\nbull-baiting and badgering me, come out! Which I meantersay as sech if\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99re a man, come on! Which I meantersay that what I say, I meantersay\r\nand stand or fall by!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI drew Joe away, and he immediately became placable; merely stating to\r\nme, in an obliging manner and as a polite expostulatory notice to any\r\none whom it might happen to concern, that he were not a going to be\r\nbull-baited and badgered in his own place. Mr. Jaggers had risen when\r\nJoe demonstrated, and had backed near the door. Without evincing\r\nany inclination to come in again, he there delivered his valedictory\r\nremarks. They were these.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Mr. Pip, I think the sooner you leave here--as you are to be a\r\ngentleman--the better. Let it stand for this day week, and you shall\r\nreceive my printed address in the meantime. You can take a hackney-coach\r\nat the stage-coach office in London, and come straight to me.\r\nUnderstand, that I express no opinion, one way or other, on the trust\r\nI undertake. I am paid for undertaking it, and I do so. Now, understand\r\nthat, finally. Understand that!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was throwing his finger at both of us, and I think would have gone\r\non, but for his seeming to think Joe dangerous, and going off.\r\n\r\nSomething came into my head which induced me to run after him, as he was\r\ngoing down to the Jolly Bargemen, where he had left a hired carriage.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI beg your pardon, Mr. Jaggers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHalloa!\xe2\x80\x9d said he, facing round, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat\xe2\x80\x99s the matter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish to be quite right, Mr. Jaggers, and to keep to your directions;\r\nso I thought I had better ask. Would there be any objection to my taking\r\nleave of any one I know, about here, before I go away?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, looking as if he hardly understood me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t mean in the village only, but up town?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cNo objection.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI thanked him and ran home again, and there I found that Joe had already\r\nlocked the front door and vacated the state parlor, and was seated\r\nby the kitchen fire with a hand on each knee, gazing intently at the\r\nburning coals. I too sat down before the fire and gazed at the coals,\r\nand nothing was said for a long time.\r\n\r\nMy sister was in her cushioned chair in her corner, and Biddy sat at her\r\nneedle-work before the fire, and Joe sat next Biddy, and I sat next Joe\r\nin the corner opposite my sister. The more I looked into the glowing\r\ncoals, the more incapable I became of looking at Joe; the longer the\r\nsilence lasted, the more unable I felt to speak.\r\n\r\nAt length I got out, \xe2\x80\x9cJoe, have you told Biddy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Pip,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Joe, still looking at the fire, and holding his\r\nknees tight, as if he had private information that they intended to make\r\noff somewhere, \xe2\x80\x9cwhich I left it to yourself, Pip.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would rather you told, Joe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPip\xe2\x80\x99s a gentleman of fortun\xe2\x80\x99 then,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe, \xe2\x80\x9cand God bless him in\r\nit!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBiddy dropped her work, and looked at me. Joe held his knees and looked\r\nat me. I looked at both of them. After a pause, they both heartily\r\ncongratulated me; but there was a certain touch of sadness in their\r\ncongratulations that I rather resented.\r\n\r\nI took it upon myself to impress Biddy (and through Biddy, Joe) with the\r\ngrave obligation I considered my friends under, to know nothing and say\r\nnothing about the maker of my fortune. It would all come out in good\r\ntime, I observed, and in the meanwhile nothing was to be said, save\r\nthat I had come into great expectations from a mysterious patron. Biddy\r\nnodded her head thoughtfully at the fire as she took up her work again,\r\nand said she would be very particular; and Joe, still detaining his\r\nknees, said, \xe2\x80\x9cAy, ay, I\xe2\x80\x99ll be ekervally partickler, Pip;\xe2\x80\x9d and then they\r\ncongratulated me again, and went on to express so much wonder at the\r\nnotion of my being a gentleman that I didn\xe2\x80\x99t half like it.\r\n\r\nInfinite pains were then taken by Biddy to convey to my sister some idea\r\nof what had happened. To the best of my belief, those efforts entirely\r\nfailed. She laughed and nodded her head a great many times, and even\r\nrepeated after Biddy, the words \xe2\x80\x9cPip\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cProperty.\xe2\x80\x9d But I doubt if\r\nthey had more meaning in them than an election cry, and I cannot suggest\r\na darker picture of her state of mind.\r\n\r\nI never could have believed it without experience, but as Joe and\r\nBiddy became more at their cheerful ease again, I became quite gloomy.\r\nDissatisfied with my fortune, of course I could not be; but it is\r\npossible that I may have been, without quite knowing it, dissatisfied\r\nwith myself.\r\n\r\nAny how, I sat with my elbow on my knee and my face upon my hand,\r\nlooking into the fire, as those two talked about my going away, and\r\nabout what they should do without me, and all that. And whenever I\r\ncaught one of them looking at me, though never so pleasantly (and they\r\noften looked at me,--particularly Biddy), I felt offended: as if they\r\nwere expressing some mistrust of me. Though Heaven knows they never did\r\nby word or sign.\r\n\r\nAt those times I would get up and look out at the door; for our kitchen\r\ndoor opened at once upon the night, and stood open on summer evenings to\r\nair the room. The very stars to which I then raised my eyes, I am afraid\r\nI took to be but poor and humble stars for glittering on the rustic\r\nobjects among which I had passed my life.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSaturday night,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, when we sat at our supper of bread and cheese\r\nand beer. \xe2\x80\x9cFive more days, and then the day before the day! They\xe2\x80\x99ll soon\r\ngo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Pip,\xe2\x80\x9d observed Joe, whose voice sounded hollow in his beer-mug.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99ll soon go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSoon, soon go,\xe2\x80\x9d said Biddy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have been thinking, Joe, that when I go down town on Monday, and\r\norder my new clothes, I shall tell the tailor that I\xe2\x80\x99ll come and put\r\nthem on there, or that I\xe2\x80\x99ll have them sent to Mr. Pumblechook\xe2\x80\x99s. It\r\nwould be very disagreeable to be stared at by all the people here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. and Mrs. Hubble might like to see you in your new gen-teel figure\r\ntoo, Pip,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe, industriously cutting his bread, with his cheese on\r\nit, in the palm of his left hand, and glancing at my untasted supper\r\nas if he thought of the time when we used to compare slices. \xe2\x80\x9cSo might\r\nWopsle. And the Jolly Bargemen might take it as a compliment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s just what I don\xe2\x80\x99t want, Joe. They would make such a business of\r\nit,--such a coarse and common business,--that I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t bear myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, that indeed, Pip!\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t abear yourself--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBiddy asked me here, as she sat holding my sister\xe2\x80\x99s plate, \xe2\x80\x9cHave you\r\nthought about when you\xe2\x80\x99ll show yourself to Mr. Gargery, and your sister\r\nand me? You will show yourself to us; won\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBiddy,\xe2\x80\x9d I returned with some resentment, \xe2\x80\x9cyou are so exceedingly quick\r\nthat it\xe2\x80\x99s difficult to keep up with you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n(\xe2\x80\x9cShe always were quick,\xe2\x80\x9d observed Joe.)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you had waited another moment, Biddy, you would have heard me say\r\nthat I shall bring my clothes here in a bundle one evening,--most likely\r\non the evening before I go away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBiddy said no more. Handsomely forgiving her, I soon exchanged an\r\naffectionate good night with her and Joe, and went up to bed. When I got\r\ninto my little room, I sat down and took a long look at it, as a mean\r\nlittle room that I should soon be parted from and raised above, for\r\never. It was furnished with fresh young remembrances too, and even at\r\nthe same moment I fell into much the same confused division of mind\r\nbetween it and the better rooms to which I was going, as I had been in\r\nso often between the forge and Miss Havisham\xe2\x80\x99s, and Biddy and Estella.\r\n\r\nThe sun had been shining brightly all day on the roof of my attic, and\r\nthe room was warm. As I put the window open and stood looking out, I saw\r\nJoe come slowly forth at the dark door, below, and take a turn or two\r\nin the air; and then I saw Biddy come, and bring him a pipe and light\r\nit for him. He never smoked so late, and it seemed to hint to me that he\r\nwanted comforting, for some reason or other.\r\n\r\nHe presently stood at the door immediately beneath me, smoking his pipe,\r\nand Biddy stood there too, quietly talking to him, and I knew that they\r\ntalked of me, for I heard my name mentioned in an endearing tone by both\r\nof them more than once. I would not have listened for more, if I could\r\nhave heard more; so I drew away from the window, and sat down in my one\r\nchair by the bedside, feeling it very sorrowful and strange that this\r\nfirst night of my bright fortunes should be the loneliest I had ever\r\nknown.\r\n\r\nLooking towards the open window, I saw light wreaths from Joe\xe2\x80\x99s pipe\r\nfloating there, and I fancied it was like a blessing from Joe,--not\r\nobtruded on me or paraded before me, but pervading the air we shared\r\ntogether. I put my light out, and crept into bed; and it was an uneasy\r\nbed now, and I never slept the old sound sleep in it any more.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XIX\r\n\r\nMorning made a considerable difference in my general prospect of Life,\r\nand brightened it so much that it scarcely seemed the same. What lay\r\nheaviest on my mind was, the consideration that six days intervened\r\nbetween me and the day of departure; for I could not divest myself of\r\na misgiving that something might happen to London in the meanwhile, and\r\nthat, when I got there, it would be either greatly deteriorated or clean\r\ngone.\r\n\r\nJoe and Biddy were very sympathetic and pleasant when I spoke of our\r\napproaching separation; but they only referred to it when I did. After\r\nbreakfast, Joe brought out my indentures from the press in the best\r\nparlor, and we put them in the fire, and I felt that I was free. With\r\nall the novelty of my emancipation on me, I went to church with Joe, and\r\nthought perhaps the clergyman wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have read that about the rich man\r\nand the kingdom of Heaven, if he had known all.\r\n\r\nAfter our early dinner, I strolled out alone, purposing to finish off\r\nthe marshes at once, and get them done with. As I passed the church, I\r\nfelt (as I had felt during service in the morning) a sublime compassion\r\nfor the poor creatures who were destined to go there, Sunday after\r\nSunday, all their lives through, and to lie obscurely at last among the\r\nlow green mounds. I promised myself that I would do something for them\r\none of these days, and formed a plan in outline for bestowing a\r\ndinner of roast-beef and plum-pudding, a pint of ale, and a gallon of\r\ncondescension, upon everybody in the village.\r\n\r\nIf I had often thought before, with something allied to shame, of my\r\ncompanionship with the fugitive whom I had once seen limping among those\r\ngraves, what were my thoughts on this Sunday, when the place recalled\r\nthe wretch, ragged and shivering, with his felon iron and badge! My\r\ncomfort was, that it happened a long time ago, and that he had doubtless\r\nbeen transported a long way off, and that he was dead to me, and might\r\nbe veritably dead into the bargain.\r\n\r\nNo more low, wet grounds, no more dikes and sluices, no more of these\r\ngrazing cattle,--though they seemed, in their dull manner, to wear a\r\nmore respectful air now, and to face round, in order that they\r\nmight stare as long as possible at the possessor of such great\r\nexpectations,--farewell, monotonous acquaintances of my childhood,\r\nhenceforth I was for London and greatness; not for smith\xe2\x80\x99s work in\r\ngeneral, and for you! I made my exultant way to the old Battery, and,\r\nlying down there to consider the question whether Miss Havisham intended\r\nme for Estella, fell asleep.\r\n\r\nWhen I awoke, I was much surprised to find Joe sitting beside me,\r\nsmoking his pipe. He greeted me with a cheerful smile on my opening my\r\neyes, and said,--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs being the last time, Pip, I thought I\xe2\x80\x99d foller.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd Joe, I am very glad you did so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThankee, Pip.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou may be sure, dear Joe,\xe2\x80\x9d I went on, after we had shaken hands, \xe2\x80\x9cthat\r\nI shall never forget you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no, Pip!\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe, in a comfortable tone, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sure of that. Ay,\r\nay, old chap! Bless you, it were only necessary to get it well round in\r\na man\xe2\x80\x99s mind, to be certain on it. But it took a bit of time to get it\r\nwell round, the change come so oncommon plump; didn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSomehow, I was not best pleased with Joe\xe2\x80\x99s being so mightily secure of\r\nme. I should have liked him to have betrayed emotion, or to have said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt does you credit, Pip,\xe2\x80\x9d or something of that sort. Therefore, I made\r\nno remark on Joe\xe2\x80\x99s first head; merely saying as to his second, that the\r\ntidings had indeed come suddenly, but that I had always wanted to be a\r\ngentleman, and had often and often speculated on what I would do, if I\r\nwere one.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you though?\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe. \xe2\x80\x9cAstonishing!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a pity now, Joe,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you did not get on a little more,\r\nwhen we had our lessons here; isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Joe. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m so awful dull. I\xe2\x80\x99m only master\r\nof my own trade. It were always a pity as I was so awful dull; but it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nno more of a pity now, than it was--this day twelvemonth--don\xe2\x80\x99t you\r\nsee?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhat I had meant was, that when I came into my property and was able to\r\ndo something for Joe, it would have been much more agreeable if he\r\nhad been better qualified for a rise in station. He was so perfectly\r\ninnocent of my meaning, however, that I thought I would mention it to\r\nBiddy in preference.\r\n\r\nSo, when we had walked home and had had tea, I took Biddy into our\r\nlittle garden by the side of the lane, and, after throwing out in a\r\ngeneral way for the elevation of her spirits, that I should never forget\r\nher, said I had a favor to ask of her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd it is, Biddy,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you will not omit any opportunity of\r\nhelping Joe on, a little.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow helping him on?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Biddy, with a steady sort of glance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell! Joe is a dear good fellow,--in fact, I think he is the dearest\r\nfellow that ever lived,--but he is rather backward in some things. For\r\ninstance, Biddy, in his learning and his manners.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAlthough I was looking at Biddy as I spoke, and although she opened her\r\neyes very wide when I had spoken, she did not look at me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, his manners! won\xe2\x80\x99t his manners do then?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Biddy, plucking a\r\nblack-currant leaf.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear Biddy, they do very well here--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO! they do very well here?\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted Biddy, looking closely at the\r\nleaf in her hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHear me out,--but if I were to remove Joe into a higher sphere, as I\r\nshall hope to remove him when I fully come into my property, they would\r\nhardly do him justice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd don\xe2\x80\x99t you think he knows that?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Biddy.\r\n\r\nIt was such a very provoking question (for it had never in the most\r\ndistant manner occurred to me), that I said, snappishly,--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBiddy, what do you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBiddy, having rubbed the leaf to pieces between her hands,--and the\r\nsmell of a black-currant bush has ever since recalled to me that evening\r\nin the little garden by the side of the lane,--said, \xe2\x80\x9cHave you never\r\nconsidered that he may be proud?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cProud?\xe2\x80\x9d I repeated, with disdainful emphasis.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO! there are many kinds of pride,\xe2\x80\x9d said Biddy, looking full at me and\r\nshaking her head; \xe2\x80\x9cpride is not all of one kind--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell? What are you stopping for?\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot all of one kind,\xe2\x80\x9d resumed Biddy. \xe2\x80\x9cHe may be too proud to let any\r\none take him out of a place that he is competent to fill, and fills well\r\nand with respect. To tell you the truth, I think he is; though it sounds\r\nbold in me to say so, for you must know him far better than I do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, Biddy,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cI am very sorry to see this in you. I did not\r\nexpect to see this in you. You are envious, Biddy, and grudging. You\r\nare dissatisfied on account of my rise in fortune, and you can\xe2\x80\x99t help\r\nshowing it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you have the heart to think so,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Biddy, \xe2\x80\x9csay so. Say so\r\nover and over again, if you have the heart to think so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you have the heart to be so, you mean, Biddy,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, in a virtuous\r\nand superior tone; \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t put it off upon me. I am very sorry to see it,\r\nand it\xe2\x80\x99s a--it\xe2\x80\x99s a bad side of human nature. I did intend to ask you\r\nto use any little opportunities you might have after I was gone, of\r\nimproving dear Joe. But after this I ask you nothing. I am extremely\r\nsorry to see this in you, Biddy,\xe2\x80\x9d I repeated. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a--it\xe2\x80\x99s a bad side\r\nof human nature.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhether you scold me or approve of me,\xe2\x80\x9d returned poor Biddy, \xe2\x80\x9cyou may\r\nequally depend upon my trying to do all that lies in my power, here,\r\nat all times. And whatever opinion you take away of me, shall make\r\nno difference in my remembrance of you. Yet a gentleman should not be\r\nunjust neither,\xe2\x80\x9d said Biddy, turning away her head.\r\n\r\nI again warmly repeated that it was a bad side of human nature (in which\r\nsentiment, waiving its application, I have since seen reason to think I\r\nwas right), and I walked down the little path away from Biddy, and\r\nBiddy went into the house, and I went out at the garden gate and took a\r\ndejected stroll until supper-time; again feeling it very sorrowful and\r\nstrange that this, the second night of my bright fortunes, should be as\r\nlonely and unsatisfactory as the first.\r\n\r\nBut, morning once more brightened my view, and I extended my clemency to\r\nBiddy, and we dropped the subject. Putting on the best clothes I had,\r\nI went into town as early as I could hope to find the shops open,\r\nand presented myself before Mr. Trabb, the tailor, who was having his\r\nbreakfast in the parlor behind his shop, and who did not think it worth\r\nhis while to come out to me, but called me into him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Trabb, in a hail-fellow-well-met kind of way. \xe2\x80\x9cHow are\r\nyou, and what can I do for you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Trabb had sliced his hot roll into three feather-beds, and was\r\nslipping butter in between the blankets, and covering it up. He was a\r\nprosperous old bachelor, and his open window looked into a prosperous\r\nlittle garden and orchard, and there was a prosperous iron safe let into\r\nthe wall at the side of his fireplace, and I did not doubt that heaps of\r\nhis prosperity were put away in it in bags.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Trabb,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s an unpleasant thing to have to mention,\r\nbecause it looks like boasting; but I have come into a handsome\r\nproperty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA change passed over Mr. Trabb. He forgot the butter in bed, got up from\r\nthe bedside, and wiped his fingers on the tablecloth, exclaiming, \xe2\x80\x9cLord\r\nbless my soul!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am going up to my guardian in London,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, casually drawing some\r\nguineas out of my pocket and looking at them; \xe2\x80\x9cand I want a fashionable\r\nsuit of clothes to go in. I wish to pay for them,\xe2\x80\x9d I added--otherwise I\r\nthought he might only pretend to make them, \xe2\x80\x9cwith ready money.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Trabb, as he respectfully bent his body, opened\r\nhis arms, and took the liberty of touching me on the outside of each\r\nelbow, \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t hurt me by mentioning that. May I venture to congratulate\r\nyou? Would you do me the favor of stepping into the shop?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Trabb\xe2\x80\x99s boy was the most audacious boy in all that country-side.\r\nWhen I had entered he was sweeping the shop, and he had sweetened his\r\nlabors by sweeping over me. He was still sweeping when I came out into\r\nthe shop with Mr. Trabb, and he knocked the broom against all possible\r\ncorners and obstacles, to express (as I understood it) equality with any\r\nblacksmith, alive or dead.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHold that noise,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Trabb, with the greatest sternness, \xe2\x80\x9cor I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nknock your head off!--Do me the favor to be seated, sir. Now, this,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n said Mr. Trabb, taking down a roll of cloth, and tiding it out in a\r\nflowing manner over the counter, preparatory to getting his hand under\r\nit to show the gloss, \xe2\x80\x9cis a very sweet article. I can recommend it for\r\nyour purpose, sir, because it really is extra super. But you shall\r\nsee some others. Give me Number Four, you!\xe2\x80\x9d (To the boy, and with a\r\ndreadfully severe stare; foreseeing the danger of that miscreant\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbrushing me with it, or making some other sign of familiarity.)\r\n\r\nMr. Trabb never removed his stern eye from the boy until he had\r\ndeposited number four on the counter and was at a safe distance again.\r\nThen he commanded him to bring number five, and number eight. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd let\r\nme have none of your tricks here,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Trabb, \xe2\x80\x9cor you shall repent\r\nit, you young scoundrel, the longest day you have to live.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Trabb then bent over number four, and in a sort of deferential\r\nconfidence recommended it to me as a light article for summer wear, an\r\narticle much in vogue among the nobility and gentry, an article that\r\nit would ever be an honor to him to reflect upon a distinguished\r\nfellow-townsman\xe2\x80\x99s (if he might claim me for a fellow-townsman) having\r\nworn. \xe2\x80\x9cAre you bringing numbers five and eight, you vagabond,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr.\r\nTrabb to the boy after that, \xe2\x80\x9cor shall I kick you out of the shop and\r\nbring them myself?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI selected the materials for a suit, with the assistance of Mr. Trabb\xe2\x80\x99s\r\njudgment, and re-entered the parlor to be measured. For although Mr.\r\nTrabb had my measure already, and had previously been quite contented\r\nwith it, he said apologetically that it \xe2\x80\x9cwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do under existing\r\ncircumstances, sir,--wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do at all.\xe2\x80\x9d So, Mr. Trabb measured and\r\ncalculated me in the parlor, as if I were an estate and he the finest\r\nspecies of surveyor, and gave himself such a world of trouble that\r\nI felt that no suit of clothes could possibly remunerate him for his\r\npains. When he had at last done and had appointed to send the articles\r\nto Mr. Pumblechook\xe2\x80\x99s on the Thursday evening, he said, with his hand\r\nupon the parlor lock, \xe2\x80\x9cI know, sir, that London gentlemen cannot be\r\nexpected to patronize local work, as a rule; but if you would give me a\r\nturn now and then in the quality of a townsman, I should greatly esteem\r\nit. Good morning, sir, much obliged.--Door!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe last word was flung at the boy, who had not the least notion what\r\nit meant. But I saw him collapse as his master rubbed me out with his\r\nhands, and my first decided experience of the stupendous power of money\r\nwas, that it had morally laid upon his back Trabb\xe2\x80\x99s boy.\r\n\r\nAfter this memorable event, I went to the hatter\xe2\x80\x99s, and the bootmaker\xe2\x80\x99s,\r\nand the hosier\xe2\x80\x99s, and felt rather like Mother Hubbard\xe2\x80\x99s dog whose outfit\r\nrequired the services of so many trades. I also went to the coach-office\r\nand took my place for seven o\xe2\x80\x99clock on Saturday morning. It was\r\nnot necessary to explain everywhere that I had come into a handsome\r\nproperty; but whenever I said anything to that effect, it followed that\r\nthe officiating tradesman ceased to have his attention diverted through\r\nthe window by the High Street, and concentrated his mind upon me. When\r\nI had ordered everything I wanted, I directed my steps towards\r\nPumblechook\xe2\x80\x99s, and, as I approached that gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s place of business,\r\nI saw him standing at his door.\r\n\r\nHe was waiting for me with great impatience. He had been out early with\r\nthe chaise-cart, and had called at the forge and heard the news. He had\r\nprepared a collation for me in the Barnwell parlor, and he too ordered\r\nhis shopman to \xe2\x80\x9ccome out of the gangway\xe2\x80\x9d as my sacred person passed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear friend,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Pumblechook, taking me by both hands, when\r\nhe and I and the collation were alone, \xe2\x80\x9cI give you joy of your good\r\nfortune. Well deserved, well deserved!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis was coming to the point, and I thought it a sensible way of\r\nexpressing himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo think,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Pumblechook, after snorting admiration at me for\r\nsome moments, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I should have been the humble instrument of leading\r\nup to this, is a proud reward.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI begged Mr. Pumblechook to remember that nothing was to be ever said or\r\nhinted, on that point.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear young friend,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Pumblechook; \xe2\x80\x9cif you will allow me to\r\ncall you so--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI murmured \xe2\x80\x9cCertainly,\xe2\x80\x9d and Mr. Pumblechook took me by both hands again,\r\nand communicated a movement to his waistcoat, which had an emotional\r\nappearance, though it was rather low down, \xe2\x80\x9cMy dear young friend, rely\r\nupon my doing my little all in your absence, by keeping the fact before\r\nthe mind of Joseph.--Joseph!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Pumblechook, in the way of a\r\ncompassionate adjuration. \xe2\x80\x9cJoseph!! Joseph!!!\xe2\x80\x9d Thereupon he shook his\r\nhead and tapped it, expressing his sense of deficiency in Joseph.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut my dear young friend,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Pumblechook, \xe2\x80\x9cyou must be hungry,\r\nyou must be exhausted. Be seated. Here is a chicken had round from the\r\nBoar, here is a tongue had round from the Boar, here\xe2\x80\x99s one or two little\r\nthings had round from the Boar, that I hope you may not despise. But do\r\nI,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Pumblechook, getting up again the moment after he had sat\r\ndown, \xe2\x80\x9csee afore me, him as I ever sported with in his times of happy\r\ninfancy? And may I--may I--?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis May I, meant might he shake hands? I consented, and he was fervent,\r\nand then sat down again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere is wine,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Pumblechook. \xe2\x80\x9cLet us drink, Thanks to Fortune,\r\nand may she ever pick out her favorites with equal judgment! And yet I\r\ncannot,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Pumblechook, getting up again, \xe2\x80\x9csee afore me One--and\r\nlikewise drink to One--without again expressing--May I--may I--?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI said he might, and he shook hands with me again, and emptied his glass\r\nand turned it upside down. I did the same; and if I had turned myself\r\nupside down before drinking, the wine could not have gone more direct to\r\nmy head.\r\n\r\nMr. Pumblechook helped me to the liver wing, and to the best slice of\r\ntongue (none of those out-of-the-way No Thoroughfares of Pork now), and\r\ntook, comparatively speaking, no care of himself at all. \xe2\x80\x9cAh! poultry,\r\npoultry! You little thought,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Pumblechook, apostrophizing the\r\nfowl in the dish, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen you was a young fledgling, what was in store for\r\nyou. You little thought you was to be refreshment beneath this humble\r\nroof for one as--Call it a weakness, if you will,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Pumblechook,\r\ngetting up again, \xe2\x80\x9cbut may I? may I--?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt began to be unnecessary to repeat the form of saying he might, so\r\nhe did it at once. How he ever did it so often without wounding himself\r\nwith my knife, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd your sister,\xe2\x80\x9d he resumed, after a little steady eating, \xe2\x80\x9cwhich had\r\nthe honor of bringing you up by hand! It\xe2\x80\x99s a sad picter, to reflect that\r\nshe\xe2\x80\x99s no longer equal to fully understanding the honor. May--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI saw he was about to come at me again, and I stopped him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll drink her health,\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mr. Pumblechook, leaning back in his chair, quite flaccid\r\nwith admiration, \xe2\x80\x9cthat\xe2\x80\x99s the way you know \xe2\x80\x98em, sir!\xe2\x80\x9d (I don\xe2\x80\x99t know\r\nwho Sir was, but he certainly was not I, and there was no third person\r\npresent); \xe2\x80\x9cthat\xe2\x80\x99s the way you know the noble-minded, sir! Ever forgiving\r\nand ever affable. It might,\xe2\x80\x9d said the servile Pumblechook, putting down\r\nhis untasted glass in a hurry and getting up again, \xe2\x80\x9cto a common person,\r\nhave the appearance of repeating--but may I--?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen he had done it, he resumed his seat and drank to my sister. \xe2\x80\x9cLet us\r\nnever be blind,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Pumblechook, \xe2\x80\x9cto her faults of temper, but it\r\nis to be hoped she meant well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt about this time, I began to observe that he was getting flushed in\r\nthe face; as to myself, I felt all face, steeped in wine and smarting.\r\n\r\nI mentioned to Mr. Pumblechook that I wished to have my new clothes\r\nsent to his house, and he was ecstatic on my so distinguishing him. I\r\nmentioned my reason for desiring to avoid observation in the village,\r\nand he lauded it to the skies. There was nobody but himself, he\r\nintimated, worthy of my confidence, and--in short, might he? Then he\r\nasked me tenderly if I remembered our boyish games at sums, and how we\r\nhad gone together to have me bound apprentice, and, in effect, how he\r\nhad ever been my favorite fancy and my chosen friend? If I had taken\r\nten times as many glasses of wine as I had, I should have known that he\r\nnever had stood in that relation towards me, and should in my heart of\r\nhearts have repudiated the idea. Yet for all that, I remember feeling\r\nconvinced that I had been much mistaken in him, and that he was a\r\nsensible, practical, good-hearted prime fellow.\r\n\r\nBy degrees he fell to reposing such great confidence in me, as to ask my\r\nadvice in reference to his own affairs. He mentioned that there was an\r\nopportunity for a great amalgamation and monopoly of the corn and seed\r\ntrade on those premises, if enlarged, such as had never occurred\r\nbefore in that or any other neighborhood. What alone was wanting to the\r\nrealization of a vast fortune, he considered to be More Capital.\r\nThose were the two little words, more capital. Now it appeared to him\r\n(Pumblechook) that if that capital were got into the business, through a\r\nsleeping partner, sir,--which sleeping partner would have nothing to\r\ndo but walk in, by self or deputy, whenever he pleased, and examine\r\nthe books,--and walk in twice a year and take his profits away in his\r\npocket, to the tune of fifty per cent,--it appeared to him that that\r\nmight be an opening for a young gentleman of spirit combined with\r\nproperty, which would be worthy of his attention. But what did I think?\r\nHe had great confidence in my opinion, and what did I think? I gave it\r\nas my opinion. \xe2\x80\x9cWait a bit!\xe2\x80\x9d The united vastness and distinctness of\r\nthis view so struck him, that he no longer asked if he might shake hands\r\nwith me, but said he really must,--and did.\r\n\r\nWe drank all the wine, and Mr. Pumblechook pledged himself over and over\r\nagain to keep Joseph up to the mark (I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what mark), and to\r\nrender me efficient and constant service (I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what service). He\r\nalso made known to me for the first time in my life, and certainly after\r\nhaving kept his secret wonderfully well, that he had always said of me,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat boy is no common boy, and mark me, his fortun\xe2\x80\x99 will be no common\r\nfortun\xe2\x80\x99.\xe2\x80\x9d He said with a tearful smile that it was a singular thing to\r\nthink of now, and I said so too. Finally, I went out into the air, with\r\na dim perception that there was something unwonted in the conduct of the\r\nsunshine, and found that I had slumberously got to the turnpike without\r\nhaving taken any account of the road.\r\n\r\nThere, I was roused by Mr. Pumblechook\xe2\x80\x99s hailing me. He was a long way\r\ndown the sunny street, and was making expressive gestures for me to\r\nstop. I stopped, and he came up breathless.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, my dear friend,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, when he had recovered wind for speech.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot if I can help it. This occasion shall not entirely pass without\r\nthat affability on your part.--May I, as an old friend and well-wisher?\r\nMay I?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe shook hands for the hundredth time at least, and he ordered a young\r\ncarter out of my way with the greatest indignation. Then, he blessed\r\nme and stood waving his hand to me until I had passed the crook in the\r\nroad; and then I turned into a field and had a long nap under a hedge\r\nbefore I pursued my way home.\r\n\r\nI had scant luggage to take with me to London, for little of the little\r\nI possessed was adapted to my new station. But I began packing that same\r\nafternoon, and wildly packed up things that I knew I should want next\r\nmorning, in a fiction that there was not a moment to be lost.\r\n\r\nSo, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday, passed; and on Friday morning I\r\nwent to Mr. Pumblechook\xe2\x80\x99s, to put on my new clothes and pay my visit to\r\nMiss Havisham. Mr. Pumblechook\xe2\x80\x99s own room was given up to me to dress\r\nin, and was decorated with clean towels expressly for the event. My\r\nclothes were rather a disappointment, of course. Probably every new\r\nand eagerly expected garment ever put on since clothes came in, fell\r\na trifle short of the wearer\xe2\x80\x99s expectation. But after I had had my\r\nnew suit on some half an hour, and had gone through an immensity of\r\nposturing with Mr. Pumblechook\xe2\x80\x99s very limited dressing-glass, in the\r\nfutile endeavor to see my legs, it seemed to fit me better. It being\r\nmarket morning at a neighboring town some ten miles off, Mr. Pumblechook\r\nwas not at home. I had not told him exactly when I meant to leave, and\r\nwas not likely to shake hands with him again before departing. This was\r\nall as it should be, and I went out in my new array, fearfully ashamed\r\nof having to pass the shopman, and suspicious after all that I was at a\r\npersonal disadvantage, something like Joe\xe2\x80\x99s in his Sunday suit.\r\n\r\nI went circuitously to Miss Havisham\xe2\x80\x99s by all the back ways, and rang\r\nat the bell constrainedly, on account of the stiff long fingers of my\r\ngloves. Sarah Pocket came to the gate, and positively reeled back when\r\nshe saw me so changed; her walnut-shell countenance likewise turned from\r\nbrown to green and yellow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou?\xe2\x80\x9d said she. \xe2\x80\x9cYou? Good gracious! What do you want?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am going to London, Miss Pocket,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cand want to say good-bye to\r\nMiss Havisham.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI was not expected, for she left me locked in the yard, while she went\r\nto ask if I were to be admitted. After a very short delay, she returned\r\nand took me up, staring at me all the way.\r\n\r\nMiss Havisham was taking exercise in the room with the long spread\r\ntable, leaning on her crutch stick. The room was lighted as of yore, and\r\nat the sound of our entrance, she stopped and turned. She was then just\r\nabreast of the rotted bride-cake.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t go, Sarah,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, Pip?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI start for London, Miss Havisham, to-morrow,\xe2\x80\x9d I was exceedingly\r\ncareful what I said, \xe2\x80\x9cand I thought you would kindly not mind my taking\r\nleave of you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is a gay figure, Pip,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, making her crutch stick play\r\nround me, as if she, the fairy godmother who had changed me, were\r\nbestowing the finishing gift.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have come into such good fortune since I saw you last, Miss\r\nHavisham,\xe2\x80\x9d I murmured. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I am so grateful for it, Miss Havisham!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, ay!\xe2\x80\x9d said she, looking at the discomfited and envious Sarah, with\r\ndelight. \xe2\x80\x9cI have seen Mr. Jaggers. I have heard about it, Pip. So you go\r\nto-morrow?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Miss Havisham.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you are adopted by a rich person?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Miss Havisham.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot named?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Miss Havisham.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd Mr. Jaggers is made your guardian?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Miss Havisham.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe quite gloated on these questions and answers, so keen was her\r\nenjoyment of Sarah Pocket\xe2\x80\x99s jealous dismay. \xe2\x80\x9cWell!\xe2\x80\x9d she went on; \xe2\x80\x9cyou\r\nhave a promising career before you. Be good--deserve it--and abide by\r\nMr. Jaggers\xe2\x80\x99s instructions.\xe2\x80\x9d She looked at me, and looked at Sarah, and\r\nSarah\xe2\x80\x99s countenance wrung out of her watchful face a cruel smile. \xe2\x80\x9cGood-bye,\r\nPip!--you will always keep the name of Pip, you know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Miss Havisham.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-bye, Pip!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe stretched out her hand, and I went down on my knee and put it to\r\nmy lips. I had not considered how I should take leave of her; it came\r\nnaturally to me at the moment to do this. She looked at Sarah Pocket\r\nwith triumph in her weird eyes, and so I left my fairy godmother, with\r\nboth her hands on her crutch stick, standing in the midst of the dimly\r\nlighted room beside the rotten bride-cake that was hidden in cobwebs.\r\n\r\nSarah Pocket conducted me down, as if I were a ghost who must be seen\r\nout. She could not get over my appearance, and was in the last degree\r\nconfounded. I said \xe2\x80\x9cGood-bye, Miss Pocket;\xe2\x80\x9d but she merely stared, and\r\ndid not seem collected enough to know that I had spoken. Clear of the\r\nhouse, I made the best of my way back to Pumblechook\xe2\x80\x99s, took off my new\r\nclothes, made them into a bundle, and went back home in my older dress,\r\ncarrying it--to speak the truth--much more at my ease too, though I had\r\nthe bundle to carry.\r\n\r\nAnd now, those six days which were to have run out so slowly, had\r\nrun out fast and were gone, and to-morrow looked me in the face more\r\nsteadily than I could look at it. As the six evenings had dwindled\r\naway, to five, to four, to three, to two, I had become more and more\r\nappreciative of the society of Joe and Biddy. On this last evening, I\r\ndressed my self out in my new clothes for their delight, and sat in my\r\nsplendor until bedtime. We had a hot supper on the occasion, graced by\r\nthe inevitable roast fowl, and we had some flip to finish with. We were\r\nall very low, and none the higher for pretending to be in spirits.\r\n\r\nI was to leave our village at five in the morning, carrying my little\r\nhand-portmanteau, and I had told Joe that I wished to walk away all\r\nalone. I am afraid--sore afraid--that this purpose originated in my\r\nsense of the contrast there would be between me and Joe, if we went to\r\nthe coach together. I had pretended with myself that there was nothing\r\nof this taint in the arrangement; but when I went up to my little room\r\non this last night, I felt compelled to admit that it might be so, and\r\nhad an impulse upon me to go down again and entreat Joe to walk with me\r\nin the morning. I did not.\r\n\r\nAll night there were coaches in my broken sleep, going to wrong places\r\ninstead of to London, and having in the traces, now dogs, now cats, now\r\npigs, now men,--never horses. Fantastic failures of journeys occupied\r\nme until the day dawned and the birds were singing. Then, I got up and\r\npartly dressed, and sat at the window to take a last look out, and in\r\ntaking it fell asleep.\r\n\r\nBiddy was astir so early to get my breakfast, that, although I did not\r\nsleep at the window an hour, I smelt the smoke of the kitchen fire when\r\nI started up with a terrible idea that it must be late in the afternoon.\r\nBut long after that, and long after I had heard the clinking of the\r\nteacups and was quite ready, I wanted the resolution to go downstairs.\r\nAfter all, I remained up there, repeatedly unlocking and unstrapping\r\nmy small portmanteau and locking and strapping it up again, until Biddy\r\ncalled to me that I was late.\r\n\r\nIt was a hurried breakfast with no taste in it. I got up from the meal,\r\nsaying with a sort of briskness, as if it had only just occurred to me,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell! I suppose I must be off!\xe2\x80\x9d and then I kissed my sister who was\r\nlaughing and nodding and shaking in her usual chair, and kissed\r\nBiddy, and threw my arms around Joe\xe2\x80\x99s neck. Then I took up my little\r\nportmanteau and walked out. The last I saw of them was, when I presently\r\nheard a scuffle behind me, and looking back, saw Joe throwing an old\r\nshoe after me and Biddy throwing another old shoe. I stopped then, to\r\nwave my hat, and dear old Joe waved his strong right arm above his head,\r\ncrying huskily \xe2\x80\x9cHooroar!\xe2\x80\x9d and Biddy put her apron to her face.\r\n\r\nI walked away at a good pace, thinking it was easier to go than I had\r\nsupposed it would be, and reflecting that it would never have done to\r\nhave had an old shoe thrown after the coach, in sight of all the High\r\nStreet. I whistled and made nothing of going. But the village was very\r\npeaceful and quiet, and the light mists were solemnly rising, as if to\r\nshow me the world, and I had been so innocent and little there, and all\r\nbeyond was so unknown and great, that in a moment with a strong heave\r\nand sob I broke into tears. It was by the finger-post at the end of the\r\nvillage, and I laid my hand upon it, and said, \xe2\x80\x9cGood-bye, O my dear, dear\r\nfriend!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHeaven knows we need never be ashamed of our tears, for they are rain\r\nupon the blinding dust of earth, overlying our hard hearts. I was\r\nbetter after I had cried than before,--more sorry, more aware of my own\r\ningratitude, more gentle. If I had cried before, I should have had Joe\r\nwith me then.\r\n\r\nSo subdued I was by those tears, and by their breaking out again in the\r\ncourse of the quiet walk, that when I was on the coach, and it was clear\r\nof the town, I deliberated with an aching heart whether I would not get\r\ndown when we changed horses and walk back, and have another evening at\r\nhome, and a better parting. We changed, and I had not made up my mind,\r\nand still reflected for my comfort that it would be quite practicable to\r\nget down and walk back, when we changed again. And while I was occupied\r\nwith these deliberations, I would fancy an exact resemblance to Joe\r\nin some man coming along the road towards us, and my heart would beat\r\nhigh.--As if he could possibly be there!\r\n\r\nWe changed again, and yet again, and it was now too late and too far to\r\ngo back, and I went on. And the mists had all solemnly risen now, and\r\nthe world lay spread before me.\r\n\r\nThis is the end of the first stage of Pip\xe2\x80\x99s expectations.\r\n\r\nChapter XX\r\n\r\nThe journey from our town to the metropolis was a journey of about five\r\nhours. It was a little past midday when the four-horse stage-coach by\r\nwhich I was a passenger, got into the ravel of traffic frayed out about\r\nthe Cross Keys, Wood Street, Cheapside, London.\r\n\r\nWe Britons had at that time particularly settled that it was treasonable\r\nto doubt our having and our being the best of everything: otherwise,\r\nwhile I was scared by the immensity of London, I think I might have had\r\nsome faint doubts whether it was not rather ugly, crooked, narrow, and\r\ndirty.\r\n\r\nMr. Jaggers had duly sent me his address; it was, Little Britain, and he\r\nhad written after it on his card, \xe2\x80\x9cjust out of Smithfield, and close by\r\nthe coach-office.\xe2\x80\x9d Nevertheless, a hackney-coachman, who seemed to have\r\nas many capes to his greasy great-coat as he was years old, packed me\r\nup in his coach and hemmed me in with a folding and jingling barrier of\r\nsteps, as if he were going to take me fifty miles. His getting on his\r\nbox, which I remember to have been decorated with an old weather-stained\r\npea-green hammercloth moth-eaten into rags, was quite a work of time.\r\nIt was a wonderful equipage, with six great coronets outside, and ragged\r\nthings behind for I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how many footmen to hold on by, and\r\na harrow below them, to prevent amateur footmen from yielding to the\r\ntemptation.\r\n\r\nI had scarcely had time to enjoy the coach and to think how like a\r\nstraw-yard it was, and yet how like a rag-shop, and to wonder why\r\nthe horses\xe2\x80\x99 nose-bags were kept inside, when I observed the coachman\r\nbeginning to get down, as if we were going to stop presently. And stop\r\nwe presently did, in a gloomy street, at certain offices with an open\r\ndoor, whereon was painted MR. JAGGERS.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow much?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked the coachman.\r\n\r\nThe coachman answered, \xe2\x80\x9cA shilling--unless you wish to make it more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI naturally said I had no wish to make it more.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen it must be a shilling,\xe2\x80\x9d observed the coachman. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want to\r\nget into trouble. I know him!\xe2\x80\x9d He darkly closed an eye at Mr. Jaggers\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nname, and shook his head.\r\n\r\nWhen he had got his shilling, and had in course of time completed the\r\nascent to his box, and had got away (which appeared to relieve his\r\nmind), I went into the front office with my little portmanteau in my\r\nhand and asked, Was Mr. Jaggers at home?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is not,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the clerk. \xe2\x80\x9cHe is in Court at present. Am I\r\naddressing Mr. Pip?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI signified that he was addressing Mr. Pip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Jaggers left word, would you wait in his room. He couldn\xe2\x80\x99t say how\r\nlong he might be, having a case on. But it stands to reason, his time\r\nbeing valuable, that he won\xe2\x80\x99t be longer than he can help.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith those words, the clerk opened a door, and ushered me into an inner\r\nchamber at the back. Here, we found a gentleman with one eye, in a\r\nvelveteen suit and knee-breeches, who wiped his nose with his sleeve on\r\nbeing interrupted in the perusal of the newspaper.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo and wait outside, Mike,\xe2\x80\x9d said the clerk.\r\n\r\nI began to say that I hoped I was not interrupting, when the clerk\r\nshoved this gentleman out with as little ceremony as I ever saw used,\r\nand tossing his fur cap out after him, left me alone.\r\n\r\nMr. Jaggers\xe2\x80\x99s room was lighted by a skylight only, and was a most dismal\r\nplace; the skylight, eccentrically pitched like a broken head, and the\r\ndistorted adjoining houses looking as if they had twisted themselves to\r\npeep down at me through it. There were not so many papers about, as I\r\nshould have expected to see; and there were some odd objects about, that\r\nI should not have expected to see,--such as an old rusty pistol, a\r\nsword in a scabbard, several strange-looking boxes and packages, and\r\ntwo dreadful casts on a shelf, of faces peculiarly swollen, and twitchy\r\nabout the nose. Mr. Jaggers\xe2\x80\x99s own high-backed chair was of deadly black\r\nhorsehair, with rows of brass nails round it, like a coffin; and I\r\nfancied I could see how he leaned back in it, and bit his forefinger at\r\nthe clients. The room was but small, and the clients seemed to have had\r\na habit of backing up against the wall; the wall, especially opposite to\r\nMr. Jaggers\xe2\x80\x99s chair, being greasy with shoulders. I recalled, too, that\r\nthe one-eyed gentleman had shuffled forth against the wall when I was\r\nthe innocent cause of his being turned out.\r\n\r\nI sat down in the cliental chair placed over against Mr. Jaggers\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nchair, and became fascinated by the dismal atmosphere of the place. I\r\ncalled to mind that the clerk had the same air of knowing something to\r\neverybody else\xe2\x80\x99s disadvantage, as his master had. I wondered how many\r\nother clerks there were upstairs, and whether they all claimed to have\r\nthe same detrimental mastery of their fellow-creatures. I wondered what\r\nwas the history of all the odd litter about the room, and how it came\r\nthere. I wondered whether the two swollen faces were of Mr. Jaggers\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfamily, and, if he were so unfortunate as to have had a pair of such\r\nill-looking relations, why he stuck them on that dusty perch for the\r\nblacks and flies to settle on, instead of giving them a place at home.\r\nOf course I had no experience of a London summer day, and my spirits may\r\nhave been oppressed by the hot exhausted air, and by the dust and grit\r\nthat lay thick on everything. But I sat wondering and waiting in Mr.\r\nJaggers\xe2\x80\x99s close room, until I really could not bear the two casts on the\r\nshelf above Mr. Jaggers\xe2\x80\x99s chair, and got up and went out.\r\n\r\nWhen I told the clerk that I would take a turn in the air while I\r\nwaited, he advised me to go round the corner and I should come into\r\nSmithfield. So I came into Smithfield; and the shameful place, being all\r\nasmear with filth and fat and blood and foam, seemed to stick to me. So,\r\nI rubbed it off with all possible speed by turning into a street where\r\nI saw the great black dome of Saint Paul\xe2\x80\x99s bulging at me from behind a\r\ngrim stone building which a bystander said was Newgate Prison. Following\r\nthe wall of the jail, I found the roadway covered with straw to deaden\r\nthe noise of passing vehicles; and from this, and from the quantity of\r\npeople standing about smelling strongly of spirits and beer, I inferred\r\nthat the trials were on.\r\n\r\nWhile I looked about me here, an exceedingly dirty and partially drunk\r\nminister of justice asked me if I would like to step in and hear a\r\ntrial or so: informing me that he could give me a front place for half a\r\ncrown, whence I should command a full view of the Lord Chief Justice in\r\nhis wig and robes,--mentioning that awful personage like waxwork, and\r\npresently offering him at the reduced price of eighteen-pence. As I\r\ndeclined the proposal on the plea of an appointment, he was so good as\r\nto take me into a yard and show me where the gallows was kept, and also\r\nwhere people were publicly whipped, and then he showed me the Debtors\xe2\x80\x99\r\nDoor, out of which culprits came to be hanged; heightening the interest\r\nof that dreadful portal by giving me to understand that \xe2\x80\x9cfour on \xe2\x80\x98em\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n would come out at that door the day after to-morrow at eight in the\r\nmorning, to be killed in a row. This was horrible, and gave me a\r\nsickening idea of London; the more so as the Lord Chief Justice\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nproprietor wore (from his hat down to his boots and up again to his\r\npocket-handkerchief inclusive) mildewed clothes which had evidently\r\nnot belonged to him originally, and which I took it into my head he had\r\nbought cheap of the executioner. Under these circumstances I thought\r\nmyself well rid of him for a shilling.\r\n\r\nI dropped into the office to ask if Mr. Jaggers had come in yet, and I\r\nfound he had not, and I strolled out again. This time, I made the tour\r\nof Little Britain, and turned into Bartholomew Close; and now I became\r\naware that other people were waiting about for Mr. Jaggers, as well\r\nas I. There were two men of secret appearance lounging in Bartholomew\r\nClose, and thoughtfully fitting their feet into the cracks of the\r\npavement as they talked together, one of whom said to the other when\r\nthey first passed me, that \xe2\x80\x9cJaggers would do it if it was to be done.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n There was a knot of three men and two women standing at a corner, and\r\none of the women was crying on her dirty shawl, and the other comforted\r\nher by saying, as she pulled her own shawl over her shoulders, \xe2\x80\x9cJaggers\r\nis for him, \xe2\x80\x98Melia, and what more could you have?\xe2\x80\x9d There was a red-eyed\r\nlittle Jew who came into the Close while I was loitering there, in\r\ncompany with a second little Jew whom he sent upon an errand; and\r\nwhile the messenger was gone, I remarked this Jew, who was of a highly\r\nexcitable temperament, performing a jig of anxiety under a lamp-post and\r\naccompanying himself, in a kind of frenzy, with the words, \xe2\x80\x9cO Jaggerth,\r\nJaggerth, Jaggerth! all otherth ith Cag-Maggerth, give me Jaggerth!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n These testimonies to the popularity of my guardian made a deep\r\nimpression on me, and I admired and wondered more than ever.\r\n\r\nAt length, as I was looking out at the iron gate of Bartholomew Close\r\ninto Little Britain, I saw Mr. Jaggers coming across the road towards\r\nme. All the others who were waiting saw him at the same time, and there\r\nwas quite a rush at him. Mr. Jaggers, putting a hand on my shoulder\r\nand walking me on at his side without saying anything to me, addressed\r\nhimself to his followers.\r\n\r\nFirst, he took the two secret men.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, I have nothing to say to you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Jaggers, throwing his\r\nfinger at them. \xe2\x80\x9cI want to know no more than I know. As to the result,\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s a toss-up. I told you from the first it was a toss-up. Have you\r\npaid Wemmick?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe made the money up this morning, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said one of the men,\r\nsubmissively, while the other perused Mr. Jaggers\xe2\x80\x99s face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t ask you when you made it up, or where, or whether you made it\r\nup at all. Has Wemmick got it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said both the men together.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well; then you may go. Now, I won\xe2\x80\x99t have it!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Jaggers,\r\nwaving his hand at them to put them behind him. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you say a word to\r\nme, I\xe2\x80\x99ll throw up the case.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe thought, Mr. Jaggers--\xe2\x80\x9d one of the men began, pulling off his hat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s what I told you not to do,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Jaggers. \xe2\x80\x9cYou thought! I\r\nthink for you; that\xe2\x80\x99s enough for you. If I want you, I know where to\r\nfind you; I don\xe2\x80\x99t want you to find me. Now I won\xe2\x80\x99t have it. I won\xe2\x80\x99t hear\r\na word.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe two men looked at one another as Mr. Jaggers waved them behind\r\nagain, and humbly fell back and were heard no more.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd now you!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Jaggers, suddenly stopping, and turning on\r\nthe two women with the shawls, from whom the three men had meekly\r\nseparated,--\xe2\x80\x9cOh! Amelia, is it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Mr. Jaggers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd do you remember,\xe2\x80\x9d retorted Mr. Jaggers, \xe2\x80\x9cthat but for me you\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be here and couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO yes, sir!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed both women together. \xe2\x80\x9cLord bless you, sir, well\r\nwe knows that!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen why,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Jaggers, \xe2\x80\x9cdo you come here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy Bill, sir!\xe2\x80\x9d the crying woman pleaded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, I tell you what!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Jaggers. \xe2\x80\x9cOnce for all. If you don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nknow that your Bill\xe2\x80\x99s in good hands, I know it. And if you come here\r\nbothering about your Bill, I\xe2\x80\x99ll make an example of both your Bill and\r\nyou, and let him slip through my fingers. Have you paid Wemmick?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO yes, sir! Every farden.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well. Then you have done all you have got to do. Say another\r\nword--one single word--and Wemmick shall give you your money back.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis terrible threat caused the two women to fall off immediately.\r\nNo one remained now but the excitable Jew, who had already raised the\r\nskirts of Mr. Jaggers\xe2\x80\x99s coat to his lips several times.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know this man!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Jaggers, in the same devastating\r\nstrain: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat does this fellow want?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMa thear Mithter Jaggerth. Hown brother to Habraham Latharuth?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho\xe2\x80\x99s he?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Jaggers. \xe2\x80\x9cLet go of my coat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe suitor, kissing the hem of the garment again before relinquishing\r\nit, replied, \xe2\x80\x9cHabraham Latharuth, on thuthpithion of plate.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re too late,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Jaggers. \xe2\x80\x9cI am over the way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHoly father, Mithter Jaggerth!\xe2\x80\x9d cried my excitable acquaintance,\r\nturning white, \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t thay you\xe2\x80\x99re again Habraham Latharuth!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Jaggers, \xe2\x80\x9cand there\xe2\x80\x99s an end of it. Get out of the\r\nway.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMithter Jaggerth! Half a moment! My hown cuthen\xe2\x80\x99th gone to Mithter\r\nWemmick at thith prethent minute, to hoffer him hany termth. Mithter\r\nJaggerth! Half a quarter of a moment! If you\xe2\x80\x99d have the condethenthun to\r\nbe bought off from the t\xe2\x80\x99other thide--at hany thuperior prithe!--money\r\nno object!--Mithter Jaggerth--Mithter--!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMy guardian threw his supplicant off with supreme indifference, and\r\nleft him dancing on the pavement as if it were red hot. Without further\r\ninterruption, we reached the front office, where we found the clerk and\r\nthe man in velveteen with the fur cap.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere\xe2\x80\x99s Mike,\xe2\x80\x9d said the clerk, getting down from his stool, and\r\napproaching Mr. Jaggers confidentially.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Jaggers, turning to the man, who was pulling a lock of\r\nhair in the middle of his forehead, like the Bull in Cock Robin pulling\r\nat the bell-rope; \xe2\x80\x9cyour man comes on this afternoon. Well?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Mas\xe2\x80\x99r Jaggers,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Mike, in the voice of a sufferer from a\r\nconstitutional cold; \xe2\x80\x9carter a deal o\xe2\x80\x99 trouble, I\xe2\x80\x99ve found one, sir, as\r\nmight do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is he prepared to swear?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Mas\xe2\x80\x99r Jaggers,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mike, wiping his nose on his fur cap this\r\ntime; \xe2\x80\x9cin a general way, anythink.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Jaggers suddenly became most irate. \xe2\x80\x9cNow, I warned you before,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nhe, throwing his forefinger at the terrified client, \xe2\x80\x9cthat if you ever\r\npresumed to talk in that way here, I\xe2\x80\x99d make an example of you. You\r\ninfernal scoundrel, how dare you tell ME that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe client looked scared, but bewildered too, as if he were unconscious\r\nwhat he had done.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSpooney!\xe2\x80\x9d said the clerk, in a low voice, giving him a stir with his\r\nelbow. \xe2\x80\x9cSoft Head! Need you say it face to face?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, I ask you, you blundering booby,\xe2\x80\x9d said my guardian, very sternly,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9conce more and for the last time, what the man you have brought here is\r\nprepared to swear?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMike looked hard at my guardian, as if he were trying to learn a lesson\r\nfrom his face, and slowly replied, \xe2\x80\x9cAyther to character, or to having\r\nbeen in his company and never left him all the night in question.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, be careful. In what station of life is this man?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMike looked at his cap, and looked at the floor, and looked at the\r\nceiling, and looked at the clerk, and even looked at me, before\r\nbeginning to reply in a nervous manner, \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve dressed him up like--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n when my guardian blustered out,--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat? You WILL, will you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n(\xe2\x80\x9cSpooney!\xe2\x80\x9d added the clerk again, with another stir.)\r\n\r\nAfter some helpless casting about, Mike brightened and began again:--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is dressed like a \xe2\x80\x98spectable pieman. A sort of a pastry-cook.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs he here?\xe2\x80\x9d asked my guardian.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI left him,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mike, \xe2\x80\x9ca setting on some doorsteps round the corner.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake him past that window, and let me see him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe window indicated was the office window. We all three went to\r\nit, behind the wire blind, and presently saw the client go by in an\r\naccidental manner, with a murderous-looking tall individual, in a short\r\nsuit of white linen and a paper cap. This guileless confectioner was not\r\nby any means sober, and had a black eye in the green stage of recovery,\r\nwhich was painted over.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell him to take his witness away directly,\xe2\x80\x9d said my guardian to the\r\nclerk, in extreme disgust, \xe2\x80\x9cand ask him what he means by bringing such a\r\nfellow as that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMy guardian then took me into his own room, and while he lunched,\r\nstanding, from a sandwich-box and a pocket-flask of sherry (he seemed to\r\nbully his very sandwich as he ate it), informed me what arrangements he\r\nhad made for me. I was to go to \xe2\x80\x9cBarnard\xe2\x80\x99s Inn,\xe2\x80\x9d to young Mr. Pocket\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nrooms, where a bed had been sent in for my accommodation; I was to\r\nremain with young Mr. Pocket until Monday; on Monday I was to go with\r\nhim to his father\xe2\x80\x99s house on a visit, that I might try how I liked it.\r\nAlso, I was told what my allowance was to be,--it was a very liberal\r\none,--and had handed to me from one of my guardian\xe2\x80\x99s drawers, the cards\r\nof certain tradesmen with whom I was to deal for all kinds of clothes,\r\nand such other things as I could in reason want. \xe2\x80\x9cYou will find your\r\ncredit good, Mr. Pip,\xe2\x80\x9d said my guardian, whose flask of sherry smelt\r\nlike a whole caskful, as he hastily refreshed himself, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I shall by\r\nthis means be able to check your bills, and to pull you up if I find you\r\noutrunning the constable. Of course you\xe2\x80\x99ll go wrong somehow, but that\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nno fault of mine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter I had pondered a little over this encouraging sentiment, I asked\r\nMr. Jaggers if I could send for a coach? He said it was not worth while,\r\nI was so near my destination; Wemmick should walk round with me, if I\r\npleased.\r\n\r\nI then found that Wemmick was the clerk in the next room. Another clerk\r\nwas rung down from upstairs to take his place while he was out, and I\r\naccompanied him into the street, after shaking hands with my guardian.\r\nWe found a new set of people lingering outside, but Wemmick made a way\r\namong them by saying coolly yet decisively, \xe2\x80\x9cI tell you it\xe2\x80\x99s no use; he\r\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t have a word to say to one of you;\xe2\x80\x9d and we soon got clear of them,\r\nand went on side by side.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXI\r\n\r\nCasting my eyes on Mr. Wemmick as we went along, to see what he was\r\nlike in the light of day, I found him to be a dry man, rather short in\r\nstature, with a square wooden face, whose expression seemed to have been\r\nimperfectly chipped out with a dull-edged chisel. There were some marks\r\nin it that might have been dimples, if the material had been softer and\r\nthe instrument finer, but which, as it was, were only dints. The chisel\r\nhad made three or four of these attempts at embellishment over his nose,\r\nbut had given them up without an effort to smooth them off. I judged him\r\nto be a bachelor from the frayed condition of his linen, and he appeared\r\nto have sustained a good many bereavements; for he wore at least four\r\nmourning rings, besides a brooch representing a lady and a weeping\r\nwillow at a tomb with an urn on it. I noticed, too, that several rings\r\nand seals hung at his watch-chain, as if he were quite laden with\r\nremembrances of departed friends. He had glittering eyes,--small, keen,\r\nand black,--and thin wide mottled lips. He had had them, to the best of\r\nmy belief, from forty to fifty years.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo you were never in London before?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Wemmick to me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was new here once,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Wemmick. \xe2\x80\x9cRum to think of now!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are well acquainted with it now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, yes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Wemmick. \xe2\x80\x9cI know the moves of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it a very wicked place?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked, more for the sake of saying\r\nsomething than for information.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou may get cheated, robbed, and murdered in London. But there are\r\nplenty of people anywhere, who\xe2\x80\x99ll do that for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf there is bad blood between you and them,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, to soften it off a\r\nlittle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO! I don\xe2\x80\x99t know about bad blood,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Mr. Wemmick; \xe2\x80\x9cthere\xe2\x80\x99s not\r\nmuch bad blood about. They\xe2\x80\x99ll do it, if there\xe2\x80\x99s anything to be got by\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat makes it worse.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou think so?\xe2\x80\x9d returned Mr. Wemmick. \xe2\x80\x9cMuch about the same, I should\r\nsay.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe wore his hat on the back of his head, and looked straight before him:\r\nwalking in a self-contained way as if there were nothing in the streets\r\nto claim his attention. His mouth was such a post-office of a mouth\r\nthat he had a mechanical appearance of smiling. We had got to the top of\r\nHolborn Hill before I knew that it was merely a mechanical appearance,\r\nand that he was not smiling at all.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know where Mr. Matthew Pocket lives?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked Mr. Wemmick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, nodding in the direction. \xe2\x80\x9cAt Hammersmith, west of\r\nLondon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs that far?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell! Say five miles.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, you\xe2\x80\x99re a regular cross-examiner!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Wemmick, looking at me\r\nwith an approving air. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, I know him. I know him!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was an air of toleration or depreciation about his utterance of\r\nthese words that rather depressed me; and I was still looking sideways\r\nat his block of a face in search of any encouraging note to the text,\r\nwhen he said here we were at Barnard\xe2\x80\x99s Inn. My depression was not\r\nalleviated by the announcement, for, I had supposed that establishment\r\nto be an hotel kept by Mr. Barnard, to which the Blue Boar in our town\r\nwas a mere public-house. Whereas I now found Barnard to be a disembodied\r\nspirit, or a fiction, and his inn the dingiest collection of shabby\r\nbuildings ever squeezed together in a rank corner as a club for\r\nTom-cats.\r\n\r\nWe entered this haven through a wicket-gate, and were disgorged by an\r\nintroductory passage into a melancholy little square that looked to me\r\nlike a flat burying-ground. I thought it had the most dismal trees in\r\nit, and the most dismal sparrows, and the most dismal cats, and the most\r\ndismal houses (in number half a dozen or so), that I had ever seen. I\r\nthought the windows of the sets of chambers into which those houses were\r\ndivided were in every stage of dilapidated blind and curtain, crippled\r\nflower-pot, cracked glass, dusty decay, and miserable makeshift; while\r\nTo Let, To Let, To Let, glared at me from empty rooms, as if no new\r\nwretches ever came there, and the vengeance of the soul of Barnard were\r\nbeing slowly appeased by the gradual suicide of the present occupants\r\nand their unholy interment under the gravel. A frowzy mourning of soot\r\nand smoke attired this forlorn creation of Barnard, and it had strewn\r\nashes on its head, and was undergoing penance and humiliation as a mere\r\ndust-hole. Thus far my sense of sight; while dry rot and wet rot and all\r\nthe silent rots that rot in neglected roof and cellar,--rot of rat\r\nand mouse and bug and coaching-stables near at hand besides--addressed\r\nthemselves faintly to my sense of smell, and moaned, \xe2\x80\x9cTry Barnard\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nMixture.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo imperfect was this realization of the first of my great expectations,\r\nthat I looked in dismay at Mr. Wemmick. \xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d said he, mistaking me;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthe retirement reminds you of the country. So it does me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe led me into a corner and conducted me up a flight of stairs,--which\r\nappeared to me to be slowly collapsing into sawdust, so that one of\r\nthose days the upper lodgers would look out at their doors and find\r\nthemselves without the means of coming down,--to a set of chambers on\r\nthe top floor. MR. POCKET, JUN., was painted on the door, and there was\r\na label on the letter-box, \xe2\x80\x9cReturn shortly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe hardly thought you\xe2\x80\x99d come so soon,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Wemmick explained. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t want me any more?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, thank you,\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs I keep the cash,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Wemmick observed, \xe2\x80\x9cwe shall most likely meet\r\npretty often. Good day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI put out my hand, and Mr. Wemmick at first looked at it as if he\r\nthought I wanted something. Then he looked at me, and said, correcting\r\nhimself,--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo be sure! Yes. You\xe2\x80\x99re in the habit of shaking hands?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI was rather confused, thinking it must be out of the London fashion,\r\nbut said yes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have got so out of it!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Wemmick,--\xe2\x80\x9cexcept at last. Very\r\nglad, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure, to make your acquaintance. Good day!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen we had shaken hands and he was gone, I opened the staircase window\r\nand had nearly beheaded myself, for, the lines had rotted away, and it\r\ncame down like the guillotine. Happily it was so quick that I had not\r\nput my head out. After this escape, I was content to take a foggy view\r\nof the Inn through the window\xe2\x80\x99s encrusting dirt, and to stand dolefully\r\nlooking out, saying to myself that London was decidedly overrated.\r\n\r\nMr. Pocket, Junior\xe2\x80\x99s, idea of Shortly was not mine, for I had nearly\r\nmaddened myself with looking out for half an hour, and had written\r\nmy name with my finger several times in the dirt of every pane in the\r\nwindow, before I heard footsteps on the stairs. Gradually there arose\r\nbefore me the hat, head, neckcloth, waistcoat, trousers, boots, of a\r\nmember of society of about my own standing. He had a paper-bag under\r\neach arm and a pottle of strawberries in one hand, and was out of\r\nbreath.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Pip?\xe2\x80\x9d said he.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Pocket?\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear me!\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed. \xe2\x80\x9cI am extremely sorry; but I knew there was a\r\ncoach from your part of the country at midday, and I thought you would\r\ncome by that one. The fact is, I have been out on your account,--not\r\nthat that is any excuse,--for I thought, coming from the country, you\r\nmight like a little fruit after dinner, and I went to Covent Garden\r\nMarket to get it good.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor a reason that I had, I felt as if my eyes would start out of my\r\nhead. I acknowledged his attention incoherently, and began to think this\r\nwas a dream.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear me!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Pocket, Junior. \xe2\x80\x9cThis door sticks so!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs he was fast making jam of his fruit by wrestling with the door while\r\nthe paper-bags were under his arms, I begged him to allow me to hold\r\nthem. He relinquished them with an agreeable smile, and combated with\r\nthe door as if it were a wild beast. It yielded so suddenly at last,\r\nthat he staggered back upon me, and I staggered back upon the opposite\r\ndoor, and we both laughed. But still I felt as if my eyes must start out\r\nof my head, and as if this must be a dream.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPray come in,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Pocket, Junior. \xe2\x80\x9cAllow me to lead the way. I am\r\nrather bare here, but I hope you\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to make out tolerably well\r\ntill Monday. My father thought you would get on more agreeably through\r\nto-morrow with me than with him, and might like to take a walk about\r\nLondon. I am sure I shall be very happy to show London to you. As to our\r\ntable, you won\xe2\x80\x99t find that bad, I hope, for it will be supplied from our\r\ncoffee-house here, and (it is only right I should add) at your expense,\r\nsuch being Mr. Jaggers\xe2\x80\x99s directions. As to our lodging, it\xe2\x80\x99s not by\r\nany means splendid, because I have my own bread to earn, and my father\r\nhasn\xe2\x80\x99t anything to give me, and I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be willing to take it, if he\r\nhad. This is our sitting-room,--just such chairs and tables and carpet\r\nand so forth, you see, as they could spare from home. You mustn\xe2\x80\x99t give\r\nme credit for the tablecloth and spoons and castors, because they come\r\nfor you from the coffee-house. This is my little bedroom; rather musty,\r\nbut Barnard\xe2\x80\x99s is musty. This is your bedroom; the furniture\xe2\x80\x99s hired for\r\nthe occasion, but I trust it will answer the purpose; if you should want\r\nanything, I\xe2\x80\x99ll go and fetch it. The chambers are retired, and we shall\r\nbe alone together, but we shan\xe2\x80\x99t fight, I dare say. But dear me, I beg\r\nyour pardon, you\xe2\x80\x99re holding the fruit all this time. Pray let me take\r\nthese bags from you. I am quite ashamed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs I stood opposite to Mr. Pocket, Junior, delivering him the bags, One,\r\nTwo, I saw the starting appearance come into his own eyes that I knew to\r\nbe in mine, and he said, falling back,--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLord bless me, you\xe2\x80\x99re the prowling boy!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9care the pale young gentleman!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXII\r\n\r\nThe pale young gentleman and I stood contemplating one another in\r\nBarnard\xe2\x80\x99s Inn, until we both burst out laughing. \xe2\x80\x9cThe idea of its\r\nbeing you!\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cThe idea of its being you!\xe2\x80\x9d said I. And then we\r\ncontemplated one another afresh, and laughed again. \xe2\x80\x9cWell!\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\npale young gentleman, reaching out his hand good-humoredly, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s all\r\nover now, I hope, and it will be magnanimous in you if you\xe2\x80\x99ll forgive me\r\nfor having knocked you about so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI derived from this speech that Mr. Herbert Pocket (for Herbert was the\r\npale young gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s name) still rather confounded his intention with\r\nhis execution. But I made a modest reply, and we shook hands warmly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou hadn\xe2\x80\x99t come into your good fortune at that time?\xe2\x80\x9d said Herbert\r\nPocket.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d he acquiesced: \xe2\x80\x9cI heard it had happened very lately. I was rather\r\non the lookout for good fortune then.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. Miss Havisham had sent for me, to see if she could take a fancy to\r\nme. But she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t,--at all events, she didn\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI thought it polite to remark that I was surprised to hear that.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBad taste,\xe2\x80\x9d said Herbert, laughing, \xe2\x80\x9cbut a fact. Yes, she had sent for\r\nme on a trial visit, and if I had come out of it successfully, I\r\nsuppose I should have been provided for; perhaps I should have been\r\nwhat-you-may-called it to Estella.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s that?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked, with sudden gravity.\r\n\r\nHe was arranging his fruit in plates while we talked, which divided his\r\nattention, and was the cause of his having made this lapse of a word.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAffianced,\xe2\x80\x9d he explained, still busy with the fruit. \xe2\x80\x9cBetrothed.\r\nEngaged. What\xe2\x80\x99s-his-named. Any word of that sort.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow did you bear your disappointment?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPooh!\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t care much for it. She\xe2\x80\x99s a Tartar.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Havisham?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t say no to that, but I meant Estella. That girl\xe2\x80\x99s hard and\r\nhaughty and capricious to the last degree, and has been brought up by\r\nMiss Havisham to wreak revenge on all the male sex.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat relation is she to Miss Havisham?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNone,\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cOnly adopted.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy should she wreak revenge on all the male sex? What revenge?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLord, Mr. Pip!\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you know?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear me! It\xe2\x80\x99s quite a story, and shall be saved till dinner-time. And\r\nnow let me take the liberty of asking you a question. How did you come\r\nthere, that day?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI told him, and he was attentive until I had finished, and then burst\r\nout laughing again, and asked me if I was sore afterwards? I didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nask him if he was, for my conviction on that point was perfectly\r\nestablished.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Jaggers is your guardian, I understand?\xe2\x80\x9d he went on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know he is Miss Havisham\xe2\x80\x99s man of business and solicitor, and has\r\nher confidence when nobody else has?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis was bringing me (I felt) towards dangerous ground. I answered with\r\na constraint I made no attempt to disguise, that I had seen Mr. Jaggers\r\nin Miss Havisham\xe2\x80\x99s house on the very day of our combat, but never at any\r\nother time, and that I believed he had no recollection of having ever\r\nseen me there.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe was so obliging as to suggest my father for your tutor, and he\r\ncalled on my father to propose it. Of course he knew about my father\r\nfrom his connection with Miss Havisham. My father is Miss Havisham\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncousin; not that that implies familiar intercourse between them, for he\r\nis a bad courtier and will not propitiate her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHerbert Pocket had a frank and easy way with him that was very taking.\r\nI had never seen any one then, and I have never seen any one since,\r\nwho more strongly expressed to me, in every look and tone, a natural\r\nincapacity to do anything secret and mean. There was something\r\nwonderfully hopeful about his general air, and something that at the\r\nsame time whispered to me he would never be very successful or rich. I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t know how this was. I became imbued with the notion on that first\r\noccasion before we sat down to dinner, but I cannot define by what\r\nmeans.\r\n\r\nHe was still a pale young gentleman, and had a certain conquered languor\r\nabout him in the midst of his spirits and briskness, that did not seem\r\nindicative of natural strength. He had not a handsome face, but it was\r\nbetter than handsome: being extremely amiable and cheerful. His figure\r\nwas a little ungainly, as in the days when my knuckles had taken such\r\nliberties with it, but it looked as if it would always be light and\r\nyoung. Whether Mr. Trabb\xe2\x80\x99s local work would have sat more gracefully on\r\nhim than on me, may be a question; but I am conscious that he carried\r\noff his rather old clothes much better than I carried off my new suit.\r\n\r\nAs he was so communicative, I felt that reserve on my part would be a\r\nbad return unsuited to our years. I therefore told him my small story,\r\nand laid stress on my being forbidden to inquire who my benefactor was.\r\nI further mentioned that as I had been brought up a blacksmith in a\r\ncountry place, and knew very little of the ways of politeness, I would\r\ntake it as a great kindness in him if he would give me a hint whenever\r\nhe saw me at a loss or going wrong.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith pleasure,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cthough I venture to prophesy that you\xe2\x80\x99ll want\r\nvery few hints. I dare say we shall be often together, and I should like\r\nto banish any needless restraint between us. Will you do me the favour\r\nto begin at once to call me by my Christian name, Herbert?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI thanked him and said I would. I informed him in exchange that my\r\nChristian name was Philip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t take to Philip,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, smiling, \xe2\x80\x9cfor it sounds like a moral\r\nboy out of the spelling-book, who was so lazy that he fell into a pond,\r\nor so fat that he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t see out of his eyes, or so avaricious that\r\nhe locked up his cake till the mice ate it, or so determined to go a\r\nbird\xe2\x80\x99s-nesting that he got himself eaten by bears who lived handy in the\r\nneighborhood. I tell you what I should like. We are so harmonious, and\r\nyou have been a blacksmith,---would you mind it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t mind anything that you propose,\xe2\x80\x9d I answered, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nunderstand you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWould you mind Handel for a familiar name? There\xe2\x80\x99s a charming piece of\r\nmusic by Handel, called the Harmonious Blacksmith.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should like it very much.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen, my dear Handel,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, turning round as the door opened,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9chere is the dinner, and I must beg of you to take the top of the table,\r\nbecause the dinner is of your providing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis I would not hear of, so he took the top, and I faced him. It was a\r\nnice little dinner,--seemed to me then a very Lord Mayor\xe2\x80\x99s Feast,--and\r\nit acquired additional relish from being eaten under those independent\r\ncircumstances, with no old people by, and with London all around us.\r\nThis again was heightened by a certain gypsy character that set the\r\nbanquet off; for while the table was, as Mr. Pumblechook might have\r\nsaid, the lap of luxury,--being entirely furnished forth from the\r\ncoffee-house,--the circumjacent region of sitting-room was of a\r\ncomparatively pastureless and shifty character; imposing on the waiter\r\nthe wandering habits of putting the covers on the floor (where he\r\nfell over them), the melted butter in the arm-chair, the bread on the\r\nbookshelves, the cheese in the coal-scuttle, and the boiled fowl into my\r\nbed in the next room,--where I found much of its parsley and butter in\r\na state of congelation when I retired for the night. All this made the\r\nfeast delightful, and when the waiter was not there to watch me, my\r\npleasure was without alloy.\r\n\r\nWe had made some progress in the dinner, when I reminded Herbert of his\r\npromise to tell me about Miss Havisham.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrue,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll redeem it at once. Let me introduce the topic,\r\nHandel, by mentioning that in London it is not the custom to put the\r\nknife in the mouth,--for fear of accidents,--and that while the fork is\r\nreserved for that use, it is not put further in than necessary. It is\r\nscarcely worth mentioning, only it\xe2\x80\x99s as well to do as other people do.\r\nAlso, the spoon is not generally used over-hand, but under. This has\r\ntwo advantages. You get at your mouth better (which after all is the\r\nobject), and you save a good deal of the attitude of opening oysters, on\r\nthe part of the right elbow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe offered these friendly suggestions in such a lively way, that we both\r\nlaughed and I scarcely blushed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow,\xe2\x80\x9d he pursued, \xe2\x80\x9cconcerning Miss Havisham. Miss Havisham, you must\r\nknow, was a spoilt child. Her mother died when she was a baby, and her\r\nfather denied her nothing. Her father was a country gentleman down in\r\nyour part of the world, and was a brewer. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know why it should\r\nbe a crack thing to be a brewer; but it is indisputable that while you\r\ncannot possibly be genteel and bake, you may be as genteel as never was\r\nand brew. You see it every day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYet a gentleman may not keep a public-house; may he?\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot on any account,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Herbert; \xe2\x80\x9cbut a public-house may keep a\r\ngentleman. Well! Mr. Havisham was very rich and very proud. So was his\r\ndaughter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Havisham was an only child?\xe2\x80\x9d I hazarded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStop a moment, I am coming to that. No, she was not an only child;\r\nshe had a half-brother. Her father privately married again--his cook, I\r\nrather think.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought he was proud,\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy good Handel, so he was. He married his second wife privately,\r\nbecause he was proud, and in course of time she died. When she was dead,\r\nI apprehend he first told his daughter what he had done, and then\r\nthe son became a part of the family, residing in the house you are\r\nacquainted with. As the son grew a young man, he turned out riotous,\r\nextravagant, undutiful,--altogether bad. At last his father disinherited\r\nhim; but he softened when he was dying, and left him well off, though\r\nnot nearly so well off as Miss Havisham.--Take another glass of wine,\r\nand excuse my mentioning that society as a body does not expect one\r\nto be so strictly conscientious in emptying one\xe2\x80\x99s glass, as to turn it\r\nbottom upwards with the rim on one\xe2\x80\x99s nose.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI had been doing this, in an excess of attention to his recital. I\r\nthanked him, and apologized. He said, \xe2\x80\x9cNot at all,\xe2\x80\x9d and resumed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Havisham was now an heiress, and you may suppose was looked after\r\nas a great match. Her half-brother had now ample means again, but what\r\nwith debts and what with new madness wasted them most fearfully again.\r\nThere were stronger differences between him and her than there had been\r\nbetween him and his father, and it is suspected that he cherished a deep\r\nand mortal grudge against her as having influenced the father\xe2\x80\x99s anger.\r\nNow, I come to the cruel part of the story,--merely breaking off, my\r\ndear Handel, to remark that a dinner-napkin will not go into a tumbler.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhy I was trying to pack mine into my tumbler, I am wholly unable to\r\nsay. I only know that I found myself, with a perseverance worthy of a\r\nmuch better cause, making the most strenuous exertions to compress it\r\nwithin those limits. Again I thanked him and apologized, and again he\r\nsaid in the cheerfullest manner, \xe2\x80\x9cNot at all, I am sure!\xe2\x80\x9d and resumed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere appeared upon the scene--say at the races, or the public\r\nballs, or anywhere else you like--a certain man, who made love to Miss\r\nHavisham. I never saw him (for this happened five-and-twenty years ago,\r\nbefore you and I were, Handel), but I have heard my father mention that\r\nhe was a showy man, and the kind of man for the purpose. But that he was\r\nnot to be, without ignorance or prejudice, mistaken for a gentleman, my\r\nfather most strongly asseverates; because it is a principle of his that\r\nno man who was not a true gentleman at heart ever was, since the world\r\nbegan, a true gentleman in manner. He says, no varnish can hide the\r\ngrain of the wood; and that the more varnish you put on, the more the\r\ngrain will express itself. Well! This man pursued Miss Havisham closely,\r\nand professed to be devoted to her. I believe she had not shown much\r\nsusceptibility up to that time; but all the susceptibility she possessed\r\ncertainly came out then, and she passionately loved him. There is no\r\ndoubt that she perfectly idolized him. He practised on her affection in\r\nthat systematic way, that he got great sums of money from her, and he\r\ninduced her to buy her brother out of a share in the brewery (which had\r\nbeen weakly left him by his father) at an immense price, on the plea\r\nthat when he was her husband he must hold and manage it all. Your\r\nguardian was not at that time in Miss Havisham\xe2\x80\x99s counsels, and she was\r\ntoo haughty and too much in love to be advised by any one. Her relations\r\nwere poor and scheming, with the exception of my father; he was poor\r\nenough, but not time-serving or jealous. The only independent one among\r\nthem, he warned her that she was doing too much for this man, and\r\nwas placing herself too unreservedly in his power. She took the first\r\nopportunity of angrily ordering my father out of the house, in his\r\npresence, and my father has never seen her since.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI thought of her having said, \xe2\x80\x9cMatthew will come and see me at last when\r\nI am laid dead upon that table;\xe2\x80\x9d and I asked Herbert whether his father\r\nwas so inveterate against her?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not that,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cbut she charged him, in the presence of her\r\nintended husband, with being disappointed in the hope of fawning upon\r\nher for his own advancement, and, if he were to go to her now, it would\r\nlook true--even to him--and even to her. To return to the man and make\r\nan end of him. The marriage day was fixed, the wedding dresses were\r\nbought, the wedding tour was planned out, the wedding guests were\r\ninvited. The day came, but not the bridegroom. He wrote her a letter--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhich she received,\xe2\x80\x9d I struck in, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen she was dressing for her\r\nmarriage? At twenty minutes to nine?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt the hour and minute,\xe2\x80\x9d said Herbert, nodding, \xe2\x80\x9cat which she\r\nafterwards stopped all the clocks. What was in it, further than that\r\nit most heartlessly broke the marriage off, I can\xe2\x80\x99t tell you, because I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t know. When she recovered from a bad illness that she had, she\r\nlaid the whole place waste, as you have seen it, and she has never since\r\nlooked upon the light of day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs that all the story?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked, after considering it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll I know of it; and indeed I only know so much, through piecing it\r\nout for myself; for my father always avoids it, and, even when Miss\r\nHavisham invited me to go there, told me no more of it than it was\r\nabsolutely requisite I should understand. But I have forgotten one\r\nthing. It has been supposed that the man to whom she gave her misplaced\r\nconfidence acted throughout in concert with her half-brother; that it\r\nwas a conspiracy between them; and that they shared the profits.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wonder he didn\xe2\x80\x99t marry her and get all the property,\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe may have been married already, and her cruel mortification may have\r\nbeen a part of her half-brother\xe2\x80\x99s scheme,\xe2\x80\x9d said Herbert. \xe2\x80\x9cMind! I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nknow that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat became of the two men?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked, after again considering the\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey fell into deeper shame and degradation--if there can be\r\ndeeper--and ruin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre they alive now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou said just now that Estella was not related to Miss Havisham, but\r\nadopted. When adopted?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHerbert shrugged his shoulders. \xe2\x80\x9cThere has always been an Estella, since\r\nI have heard of a Miss Havisham. I know no more. And now, Handel,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nhe, finally throwing off the story as it were, \xe2\x80\x9cthere is a perfectly\r\nopen understanding between us. All that I know about Miss Havisham, you\r\nknow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd all that I know,\xe2\x80\x9d I retorted, \xe2\x80\x9cyou know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI fully believe it. So there can be no competition or perplexity\r\nbetween you and me. And as to the condition on which you hold your\r\nadvancement in life,--namely, that you are not to inquire or discuss to\r\nwhom you owe it,--you may be very sure that it will never be encroached\r\nupon, or even approached, by me, or by any one belonging to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn truth, he said this with so much delicacy, that I felt the subject\r\ndone with, even though I should be under his father\xe2\x80\x99s roof for years and\r\nyears to come. Yet he said it with so much meaning, too, that I felt\r\nhe as perfectly understood Miss Havisham to be my benefactress, as I\r\nunderstood the fact myself.\r\n\r\nIt had not occurred to me before, that he had led up to the theme for\r\nthe purpose of clearing it out of our way; but we were so much the\r\nlighter and easier for having broached it, that I now perceived this\r\nto be the case. We were very gay and sociable, and I asked him, in the\r\ncourse of conversation, what he was? He replied, \xe2\x80\x9cA capitalist,--an\r\nInsurer of Ships.\xe2\x80\x9d I suppose he saw me glancing about the room in search\r\nof some tokens of Shipping, or capital, for he added, \xe2\x80\x9cIn the City.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI had grand ideas of the wealth and importance of Insurers of Ships in\r\nthe City, and I began to think with awe of having laid a young Insurer\r\non his back, blackened his enterprising eye, and cut his responsible\r\nhead open. But again there came upon me, for my relief, that odd\r\nimpression that Herbert Pocket would never be very successful or rich.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shall not rest satisfied with merely employing my capital in insuring\r\nships. I shall buy up some good Life Assurance shares, and cut into the\r\nDirection. I shall also do a little in the mining way. None of these\r\nthings will interfere with my chartering a few thousand tons on my own\r\naccount. I think I shall trade,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, leaning back in his chair, \xe2\x80\x9cto\r\nthe East Indies, for silks, shawls, spices, dyes, drugs, and precious\r\nwoods. It\xe2\x80\x99s an interesting trade.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the profits are large?\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTremendous!\xe2\x80\x9d said he.\r\n\r\nI wavered again, and began to think here were greater expectations than\r\nmy own.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think I shall trade, also,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, putting his thumbs in his\r\nwaist-coat pockets, \xe2\x80\x9cto the West Indies, for sugar, tobacco, and rum.\r\nAlso to Ceylon, specially for elephants\xe2\x80\x99 tusks.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will want a good many ships,\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA perfect fleet,\xe2\x80\x9d said he.\r\n\r\nQuite overpowered by the magnificence of these transactions, I asked him\r\nwhere the ships he insured mostly traded to at present?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI haven\xe2\x80\x99t begun insuring yet,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied. \xe2\x80\x9cI am looking about me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSomehow, that pursuit seemed more in keeping with Barnard\xe2\x80\x99s Inn. I said\r\n(in a tone of conviction), \xe2\x80\x9cAh-h!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. I am in a counting-house, and looking about me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs a counting-house profitable?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo--do you mean to the young fellow who\xe2\x80\x99s in it?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, in reply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, n-no; not to me.\xe2\x80\x9d He said this with the air of one carefully\r\nreckoning up and striking a balance. \xe2\x80\x9cNot directly profitable. That is,\r\nit doesn\xe2\x80\x99t pay me anything, and I have to--keep myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis certainly had not a profitable appearance, and I shook my head as\r\nif I would imply that it would be difficult to lay by much accumulative\r\ncapital from such a source of income.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut the thing is,\xe2\x80\x9d said Herbert Pocket, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you look about you.\r\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s the grand thing. You are in a counting-house, you know, and you\r\nlook about you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt struck me as a singular implication that you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be out of a\r\ncounting-house, you know, and look about you; but I silently deferred to\r\nhis experience.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen the time comes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Herbert, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen you see your opening. And you\r\ngo in, and you swoop upon it and you make your capital, and then there\r\nyou are! When you have once made your capital, you have nothing to do\r\nbut employ it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis was very like his way of conducting that encounter in the garden;\r\nvery like. His manner of bearing his poverty, too, exactly corresponded\r\nto his manner of bearing that defeat. It seemed to me that he took all\r\nblows and buffets now with just the same air as he had taken mine\r\nthen. It was evident that he had nothing around him but the simplest\r\nnecessaries, for everything that I remarked upon turned out to have been\r\nsent in on my account from the coffee-house or somewhere else.\r\n\r\nYet, having already made his fortune in his own mind, he was so\r\nunassuming with it that I felt quite grateful to him for not being\r\npuffed up. It was a pleasant addition to his naturally pleasant ways,\r\nand we got on famously. In the evening we went out for a walk in the\r\nstreets, and went half-price to the Theatre; and next day we went to\r\nchurch at Westminster Abbey, and in the afternoon we walked in the\r\nParks; and I wondered who shod all the horses there, and wished Joe did.\r\n\r\nOn a moderate computation, it was many months, that Sunday, since I had\r\nleft Joe and Biddy. The space interposed between myself and them partook\r\nof that expansion, and our marshes were any distance off. That I could\r\nhave been at our old church in my old church-going clothes, on the very\r\nlast Sunday that ever was, seemed a combination of impossibilities,\r\ngeographical and social, solar and lunar. Yet in the London streets so\r\ncrowded with people and so brilliantly lighted in the dusk of evening,\r\nthere were depressing hints of reproaches for that I had put the poor\r\nold kitchen at home so far away; and in the dead of night, the footsteps\r\nof some incapable impostor of a porter mooning about Barnard\xe2\x80\x99s Inn,\r\nunder pretence of watching it, fell hollow on my heart.\r\n\r\nOn the Monday morning at a quarter before nine, Herbert went to\r\nthe counting-house to report himself,--to look about him, too, I\r\nsuppose,--and I bore him company. He was to come away in an hour or\r\ntwo to attend me to Hammersmith, and I was to wait about for him. It\r\nappeared to me that the eggs from which young Insurers were hatched were\r\nincubated in dust and heat, like the eggs of ostriches, judging from the\r\nplaces to which those incipient giants repaired on a Monday morning. Nor\r\ndid the counting-house where Herbert assisted, show in my eyes as at\r\nall a good Observatory; being a back second floor up a yard, of a grimy\r\npresence in all particulars, and with a look into another back second\r\nfloor, rather than a look out.\r\n\r\nI waited about until it was noon, and I went upon \xe2\x80\x98Change, and I saw\r\nfluey men sitting there under the bills about shipping, whom I took to\r\nbe great merchants, though I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t understand why they should all be\r\nout of spirits. When Herbert came, we went and had lunch at a celebrated\r\nhouse which I then quite venerated, but now believe to have been the\r\nmost abject superstition in Europe, and where I could not help noticing,\r\neven then, that there was much more gravy on the tablecloths and knives\r\nand waiters\xe2\x80\x99 clothes, than in the steaks. This collation disposed of at\r\na moderate price (considering the grease, which was not charged for), we\r\nwent back to Barnard\xe2\x80\x99s Inn and got my little portmanteau, and then took\r\ncoach for Hammersmith. We arrived there at two or three o\xe2\x80\x99clock in\r\nthe afternoon, and had very little way to walk to Mr. Pocket\xe2\x80\x99s house.\r\nLifting the latch of a gate, we passed direct into a little garden\r\noverlooking the river, where Mr. Pocket\xe2\x80\x99s children were playing\r\nabout. And unless I deceive myself on a point where my interests or\r\nprepossessions are certainly not concerned, I saw that Mr. and Mrs.\r\nPocket\xe2\x80\x99s children were not growing up or being brought up, but were\r\ntumbling up.\r\n\r\nMrs. Pocket was sitting on a garden chair under a tree, reading, with\r\nher legs upon another garden chair; and Mrs. Pocket\xe2\x80\x99s two nurse-maids\r\nwere looking about them while the children played. \xe2\x80\x9cMamma,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nHerbert, \xe2\x80\x9cthis is young Mr. Pip.\xe2\x80\x9d Upon which Mrs. Pocket received me\r\nwith an appearance of amiable dignity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMaster Alick and Miss Jane,\xe2\x80\x9d cried one of the nurses to two of the\r\nchildren, \xe2\x80\x9cif you go a bouncing up against them bushes you\xe2\x80\x99ll fall over\r\ninto the river and be drownded, and what\xe2\x80\x99ll your pa say then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt the same time this nurse picked up Mrs. Pocket\xe2\x80\x99s handkerchief, and\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cIf that don\xe2\x80\x99t make six times you\xe2\x80\x99ve dropped it, Mum!\xe2\x80\x9d Upon which\r\nMrs. Pocket laughed and said, \xe2\x80\x9cThank you, Flopson,\xe2\x80\x9d and settling herself\r\nin one chair only, resumed her book. Her countenance immediately assumed\r\na knitted and intent expression as if she had been reading for a week,\r\nbut before she could have read half a dozen lines, she fixed her eyes\r\nupon me, and said, \xe2\x80\x9cI hope your mamma is quite well?\xe2\x80\x9d This unexpected\r\ninquiry put me into such a difficulty that I began saying in the\r\nabsurdest way that if there had been any such person I had no doubt she\r\nwould have been quite well and would have been very much obliged and\r\nwould have sent her compliments, when the nurse came to my rescue.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried, picking up the pocket-handkerchief, \xe2\x80\x9cif that don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nmake seven times! What ARE you a doing of this afternoon, Mum!\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs.\r\nPocket received her property, at first with a look of unutterable\r\nsurprise as if she had never seen it before, and then with a laugh of\r\nrecognition, and said, \xe2\x80\x9cThank you, Flopson,\xe2\x80\x9d and forgot me, and went on\r\nreading.\r\n\r\nI found, now I had leisure to count them, that there were no fewer than\r\nsix little Pockets present, in various stages of tumbling up. I had\r\nscarcely arrived at the total when a seventh was heard, as in the region\r\nof air, wailing dolefully.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf there ain\xe2\x80\x99t Baby!\xe2\x80\x9d said Flopson, appearing to think it most\r\nsurprising. \xe2\x80\x9cMake haste up, Millers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMillers, who was the other nurse, retired into the house, and by degrees\r\nthe child\xe2\x80\x99s wailing was hushed and stopped, as if it were a young\r\nventriloquist with something in its mouth. Mrs. Pocket read all the\r\ntime, and I was curious to know what the book could be.\r\n\r\nWe were waiting, I supposed, for Mr. Pocket to come out to us; at any\r\nrate we waited there, and so I had an opportunity of observing the\r\nremarkable family phenomenon that whenever any of the children strayed\r\nnear Mrs. Pocket in their play, they always tripped themselves up and\r\ntumbled over her,--always very much to her momentary astonishment, and\r\ntheir own more enduring lamentation. I was at a loss to account for\r\nthis surprising circumstance, and could not help giving my mind to\r\nspeculations about it, until by and by Millers came down with the baby,\r\nwhich baby was handed to Flopson, which Flopson was handing it to Mrs.\r\nPocket, when she too went fairly head foremost over Mrs. Pocket, baby\r\nand all, and was caught by Herbert and myself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGracious me, Flopson!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Pocket, looking off her book for a\r\nmoment, \xe2\x80\x9ceverybody\xe2\x80\x99s tumbling!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGracious you, indeed, Mum!\xe2\x80\x9d returned Flopson, very red in the face;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cwhat have you got there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI got here, Flopson?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mrs. Pocket.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, if it ain\xe2\x80\x99t your footstool!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Flopson. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd if you keep it\r\nunder your skirts like that, who\xe2\x80\x99s to help tumbling? Here! Take the\r\nbaby, Mum, and give me your book.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Pocket acted on the advice, and inexpertly danced the infant a\r\nlittle in her lap, while the other children played about it. This had\r\nlasted but a very short time, when Mrs. Pocket issued summary orders\r\nthat they were all to be taken into the house for a nap. Thus I made the\r\nsecond discovery on that first occasion, that the nurture of the little\r\nPockets consisted of alternately tumbling up and lying down.\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances, when Flopson and Millers had got the children\r\ninto the house, like a little flock of sheep, and Mr. Pocket came out\r\nof it to make my acquaintance, I was not much surprised to find that Mr.\r\nPocket was a gentleman with a rather perplexed expression of face, and\r\nwith his very gray hair disordered on his head, as if he didn\xe2\x80\x99t quite\r\nsee his way to putting anything straight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXIII\r\n\r\nMr. Pocket said he was glad to see me, and he hoped I was not sorry to\r\nsee him. \xe2\x80\x9cFor, I really am not,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, with his son\xe2\x80\x99s smile,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9can alarming personage.\xe2\x80\x9d He was a young-looking man, in spite of\r\nhis perplexities and his very gray hair, and his manner seemed quite\r\nnatural. I use the word natural, in the sense of its being unaffected;\r\nthere was something comic in his distraught way, as though it would have\r\nbeen downright ludicrous but for his own perception that it was very\r\nnear being so. When he had talked with me a little, he said to Mrs.\r\nPocket, with a rather anxious contraction of his eyebrows, which were\r\nblack and handsome, \xe2\x80\x9cBelinda, I hope you have welcomed Mr. Pip?\xe2\x80\x9d And she\r\nlooked up from her book, and said, \xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d She then smiled upon me in an\r\nabsent state of mind, and asked me if I liked the taste of orange-flower\r\nwater? As the question had no bearing, near or remote, on any foregone\r\nor subsequent transaction, I consider it to have been thrown out, like\r\nher previous approaches, in general conversational condescension.\r\n\r\nI found out within a few hours, and may mention at once, that Mrs.\r\nPocket was the only daughter of a certain quite accidental deceased\r\nKnight, who had invented for himself a conviction that his deceased\r\nfather would have been made a Baronet but for somebody\xe2\x80\x99s determined\r\nopposition arising out of entirely personal motives,--I forget whose,\r\nif I ever knew,--the Sovereign\xe2\x80\x99s, the Prime Minister\xe2\x80\x99s, the Lord\r\nChancellor\xe2\x80\x99s, the Archbishop of Canterbury\xe2\x80\x99s, anybody\xe2\x80\x99s,--and had\r\ntacked himself on to the nobles of the earth in right of this quite\r\nsupposititious fact. I believe he had been knighted himself for storming\r\nthe English grammar at the point of the pen, in a desperate address\r\nengrossed on vellum, on the occasion of the laying of the first stone of\r\nsome building or other, and for handing some Royal Personage either the\r\ntrowel or the mortar. Be that as it may, he had directed Mrs. Pocket to\r\nbe brought up from her cradle as one who in the nature of things\r\nmust marry a title, and who was to be guarded from the acquisition of\r\nplebeian domestic knowledge.\r\n\r\nSo successful a watch and ward had been established over the young lady\r\nby this judicious parent, that she had grown up highly ornamental, but\r\nperfectly helpless and useless. With her character thus happily formed,\r\nin the first bloom of her youth she had encountered Mr. Pocket: who was\r\nalso in the first bloom of youth, and not quite decided whether to mount\r\nto the Woolsack, or to roof himself in with a mitre. As his doing the\r\none or the other was a mere question of time, he and Mrs. Pocket had\r\ntaken Time by the forelock (when, to judge from its length, it would\r\nseem to have wanted cutting), and had married without the knowledge of\r\nthe judicious parent. The judicious parent, having nothing to bestow or\r\nwithhold but his blessing, had handsomely settled that dower upon them\r\nafter a short struggle, and had informed Mr. Pocket that his wife was \xe2\x80\x9ca\r\ntreasure for a Prince.\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Pocket had invested the Prince\xe2\x80\x99s treasure\r\nin the ways of the world ever since, and it was supposed to have brought\r\nhim in but indifferent interest. Still, Mrs. Pocket was in general the\r\nobject of a queer sort of respectful pity, because she had not married\r\na title; while Mr. Pocket was the object of a queer sort of forgiving\r\nreproach, because he had never got one.\r\n\r\nMr. Pocket took me into the house and showed me my room: which was a\r\npleasant one, and so furnished as that I could use it with comfort for\r\nmy own private sitting-room. He then knocked at the doors of two other\r\nsimilar rooms, and introduced me to their occupants, by name Drummle\r\nand Startop. Drummle, an old-looking young man of a heavy order of\r\narchitecture, was whistling. Startop, younger in years and appearance,\r\nwas reading and holding his head, as if he thought himself in danger of\r\nexploding it with too strong a charge of knowledge.\r\n\r\nBoth Mr. and Mrs. Pocket had such a noticeable air of being in somebody\r\nelse\xe2\x80\x99s hands, that I wondered who really was in possession of the house\r\nand let them live there, until I found this unknown power to be the\r\nservants. It was a smooth way of going on, perhaps, in respect of saving\r\ntrouble; but it had the appearance of being expensive, for the servants\r\nfelt it a duty they owed to themselves to be nice in their eating and\r\ndrinking, and to keep a deal of company downstairs. They allowed a very\r\nliberal table to Mr. and Mrs. Pocket, yet it always appeared to me that\r\nby far the best part of the house to have boarded in would have been\r\nthe kitchen,--always supposing the boarder capable of self-defence, for,\r\nbefore I had been there a week, a neighboring lady with whom the family\r\nwere personally unacquainted, wrote in to say that she had seen Millers\r\nslapping the baby. This greatly distressed Mrs. Pocket, who burst into\r\ntears on receiving the note, and said that it was an extraordinary thing\r\nthat the neighbors couldn\xe2\x80\x99t mind their own business.\r\n\r\nBy degrees I learnt, and chiefly from Herbert, that Mr. Pocket had been\r\neducated at Harrow and at Cambridge, where he had distinguished himself;\r\nbut that when he had had the happiness of marrying Mrs. Pocket very\r\nearly in life, he had impaired his prospects and taken up the calling\r\nof a Grinder. After grinding a number of dull blades,--of whom it was\r\nremarkable that their fathers, when influential, were always going to\r\nhelp him to preferment, but always forgot to do it when the blades had\r\nleft the Grindstone,--he had wearied of that poor work and had come to\r\nLondon. Here, after gradually failing in loftier hopes, he had \xe2\x80\x9cread\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n with divers who had lacked opportunities or neglected them, and had\r\nrefurbished divers others for special occasions, and had turned his\r\nacquirements to the account of literary compilation and correction,\r\nand on such means, added to some very moderate private resources, still\r\nmaintained the house I saw.\r\n\r\nMr. and Mrs. Pocket had a toady neighbor; a widow lady of that highly\r\nsympathetic nature that she agreed with everybody, blessed everybody,\r\nand shed smiles and tears on everybody, according to circumstances. This\r\nlady\xe2\x80\x99s name was Mrs. Coiler, and I had the honor of taking her down to\r\ndinner on the day of my installation. She gave me to understand on the\r\nstairs, that it was a blow to dear Mrs. Pocket that dear Mr. Pocket\r\nshould be under the necessity of receiving gentlemen to read with him.\r\nThat did not extend to me, she told me in a gush of love and confidence\r\n(at that time, I had known her something less than five minutes); if\r\nthey were all like Me, it would be quite another thing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut dear Mrs. Pocket,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Coiler, \xe2\x80\x9cafter her early\r\ndisappointment (not that dear Mr. Pocket was to blame in that), requires\r\nso much luxury and elegance--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, to stop her, for I was afraid she was going to\r\ncry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd she is of so aristocratic a disposition--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d I said again, with the same object as before.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c--That it is hard,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Coiler, \xe2\x80\x9cto have dear Mr. Pocket\xe2\x80\x99s time\r\nand attention diverted from dear Mrs. Pocket.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI could not help thinking that it might be harder if the butcher\xe2\x80\x99s time\r\nand attention were diverted from dear Mrs. Pocket; but I said nothing,\r\nand indeed had enough to do in keeping a bashful watch upon my company\r\nmanners.\r\n\r\nIt came to my knowledge, through what passed between Mrs. Pocket and\r\nDrummle while I was attentive to my knife and fork, spoon, glasses, and\r\nother instruments of self-destruction, that Drummle, whose Christian\r\nname was Bentley, was actually the next heir but one to a baronetcy.\r\nIt further appeared that the book I had seen Mrs. Pocket reading in the\r\ngarden was all about titles, and that she knew the exact date at which\r\nher grandpapa would have come into the book, if he ever had come at all.\r\nDrummle didn\xe2\x80\x99t say much, but in his limited way (he struck me as a sulky\r\nkind of fellow) he spoke as one of the elect, and recognized Mrs. Pocket\r\nas a woman and a sister. No one but themselves and Mrs. Coiler the toady\r\nneighbor showed any interest in this part of the conversation, and it\r\nappeared to me that it was painful to Herbert; but it promised to last\r\na long time, when the page came in with the announcement of a domestic\r\naffliction. It was, in effect, that the cook had mislaid the beef. To my\r\nunutterable amazement, I now, for the first time, saw Mr. Pocket\r\nrelieve his mind by going through a performance that struck me as very\r\nextraordinary, but which made no impression on anybody else, and\r\nwith which I soon became as familiar as the rest. He laid down the\r\ncarving-knife and fork,--being engaged in carving, at the moment,--put\r\nhis two hands into his disturbed hair, and appeared to make an\r\nextraordinary effort to lift himself up by it. When he had done this,\r\nand had not lifted himself up at all, he quietly went on with what he\r\nwas about.\r\n\r\nMrs. Coiler then changed the subject and began to flatter me. I liked\r\nit for a few moments, but she flattered me so very grossly that the\r\npleasure was soon over. She had a serpentine way of coming close at\r\nme when she pretended to be vitally interested in the friends and\r\nlocalities I had left, which was altogether snaky and fork-tongued; and\r\nwhen she made an occasional bounce upon Startop (who said very little to\r\nher), or upon Drummle (who said less), I rather envied them for being on\r\nthe opposite side of the table.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner the children were introduced, and Mrs. Coiler made admiring\r\ncomments on their eyes, noses, and legs,--a sagacious way of improving\r\ntheir minds. There were four little girls, and two little boys, besides\r\nthe baby who might have been either, and the baby\xe2\x80\x99s next successor who\r\nwas as yet neither. They were brought in by Flopson and Millers, much as\r\nthough those two non-commissioned officers had been recruiting somewhere\r\nfor children and had enlisted these, while Mrs. Pocket looked at the\r\nyoung Nobles that ought to have been as if she rather thought she had\r\nhad the pleasure of inspecting them before, but didn\xe2\x80\x99t quite know what\r\nto make of them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere! Give me your fork, Mum, and take the baby,\xe2\x80\x9d said Flopson. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ntake it that way, or you\xe2\x80\x99ll get its head under the table.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThus advised, Mrs. Pocket took it the other way, and got its head\r\nupon the table; which was announced to all present by a prodigious\r\nconcussion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear, dear! Give it me back, Mum,\xe2\x80\x9d said Flopson; \xe2\x80\x9cand Miss Jane, come\r\nand dance to baby, do!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOne of the little girls, a mere mite who seemed to have prematurely\r\ntaken upon herself some charge of the others, stepped out of her place\r\nby me, and danced to and from the baby until it left off crying, and\r\nlaughed. Then, all the children laughed, and Mr. Pocket (who in the\r\nmeantime had twice endeavored to lift himself up by the hair) laughed,\r\nand we all laughed and were glad.\r\n\r\nFlopson, by dint of doubling the baby at the joints like a Dutch doll,\r\nthen got it safely into Mrs. Pocket\xe2\x80\x99s lap, and gave it the nut-crackers\r\nto play with; at the same time recommending Mrs. Pocket to take notice\r\nthat the handles of that instrument were not likely to agree with its\r\neyes, and sharply charging Miss Jane to look after the same. Then, the\r\ntwo nurses left the room, and had a lively scuffle on the staircase with\r\na dissipated page who had waited at dinner, and who had clearly lost\r\nhalf his buttons at the gaming-table.\r\n\r\nI was made very uneasy in my mind by Mrs. Pocket\xe2\x80\x99s falling into a\r\ndiscussion with Drummle respecting two baronetcies, while she ate a\r\nsliced orange steeped in sugar and wine, and, forgetting all about the\r\nbaby on her lap, who did most appalling things with the nut-crackers. At\r\nlength little Jane, perceiving its young brains to be imperilled, softly\r\nleft her place, and with many small artifices coaxed the dangerous\r\nweapon away. Mrs. Pocket finishing her orange at about the same time,\r\nand not approving of this, said to Jane,--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou naughty child, how dare you? Go and sit down this instant!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMamma dear,\xe2\x80\x9d lisped the little girl, \xe2\x80\x9cbaby ood have put hith eyeth\r\nout.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow dare you tell me so?\xe2\x80\x9d retorted Mrs. Pocket. \xe2\x80\x9cGo and sit down in\r\nyour chair this moment!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Pocket\xe2\x80\x99s dignity was so crushing, that I felt quite abashed, as if\r\nI myself had done something to rouse it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBelinda,\xe2\x80\x9d remonstrated Mr. Pocket, from the other end of the table,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9chow can you be so unreasonable? Jane only interfered for the protection\r\nof baby.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will not allow anybody to interfere,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Pocket. \xe2\x80\x9cI am\r\nsurprised, Matthew, that you should expose me to the affront of\r\ninterference.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood God!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mr. Pocket, in an outbreak of desolate desperation.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre infants to be nut-crackered into their tombs, and is nobody to save\r\nthem?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will not be interfered with by Jane,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Pocket, with a\r\nmajestic glance at that innocent little offender. \xe2\x80\x9cI hope I know my poor\r\ngrandpapa\xe2\x80\x99s position. Jane, indeed!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Pocket got his hands in his hair again, and this time really did\r\nlift himself some inches out of his chair. \xe2\x80\x9cHear this!\xe2\x80\x9d he helplessly\r\nexclaimed to the elements. \xe2\x80\x9cBabies are to be nut-crackered dead, for\r\npeople\xe2\x80\x99s poor grandpapa\xe2\x80\x99s positions!\xe2\x80\x9d Then he let himself down again,\r\nand became silent.\r\n\r\nWe all looked awkwardly at the tablecloth while this was going on. A\r\npause succeeded, during which the honest and irrepressible baby made a\r\nseries of leaps and crows at little Jane, who appeared to me to be the\r\nonly member of the family (irrespective of servants) with whom it had\r\nany decided acquaintance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Drummle,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Pocket, \xe2\x80\x9cwill you ring for Flopson? Jane, you\r\nundutiful little thing, go and lie down. Now, baby darling, come with\r\nma!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe baby was the soul of honor, and protested with all its might. It\r\ndoubled itself up the wrong way over Mrs. Pocket\xe2\x80\x99s arm, exhibited a pair\r\nof knitted shoes and dimpled ankles to the company in lieu of its soft\r\nface, and was carried out in the highest state of mutiny. And it gained\r\nits point after all, for I saw it through the window within a few\r\nminutes, being nursed by little Jane.\r\n\r\nIt happened that the other five children were left behind at the\r\ndinner-table, through Flopson\xe2\x80\x99s having some private engagement, and\r\ntheir not being anybody else\xe2\x80\x99s business. I thus became aware of the\r\nmutual relations between them and Mr. Pocket, which were exemplified in\r\nthe following manner. Mr. Pocket, with the normal perplexity of his face\r\nheightened and his hair rumpled, looked at them for some minutes, as if\r\nhe couldn\xe2\x80\x99t make out how they came to be boarding and lodging in that\r\nestablishment, and why they hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been billeted by Nature on\r\nsomebody else. Then, in a distant Missionary way he asked them certain\r\nquestions,--as why little Joe had that hole in his frill, who said, Pa,\r\nFlopson was going to mend it when she had time,--and how little Fanny\r\ncame by that whitlow, who said, Pa, Millers was going to poultice it\r\nwhen she didn\xe2\x80\x99t forget. Then, he melted into parental tenderness, and\r\ngave them a shilling apiece and told them to go and play; and then as\r\nthey went out, with one very strong effort to lift himself up by the\r\nhair he dismissed the hopeless subject.\r\n\r\nIn the evening there was rowing on the river. As Drummle and Startop had\r\neach a boat, I resolved to set up mine, and to cut them both out. I was\r\npretty good at most exercises in which country boys are adepts, but as\r\nI was conscious of wanting elegance of style for the Thames,--not to say\r\nfor other waters,--I at once engaged to place myself under the tuition\r\nof the winner of a prize-wherry who plied at our stairs, and to whom I\r\nwas introduced by my new allies. This practical authority confused me\r\nvery much by saying I had the arm of a blacksmith. If he could have\r\nknown how nearly the compliment lost him his pupil, I doubt if he would\r\nhave paid it.\r\n\r\nThere was a supper-tray after we got home at night, and I think we\r\nshould all have enjoyed ourselves, but for a rather disagreeable\r\ndomestic occurrence. Mr. Pocket was in good spirits, when a housemaid\r\ncame in, and said, \xe2\x80\x9cIf you please, sir, I should wish to speak to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSpeak to your master?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Pocket, whose dignity was roused\r\nagain. \xe2\x80\x9cHow can you think of such a thing? Go and speak to Flopson. Or\r\nspeak to me--at some other time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBegging your pardon, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the housemaid, \xe2\x80\x9cI should wish to\r\nspeak at once, and to speak to master.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHereupon, Mr. Pocket went out of the room, and we made the best of\r\nourselves until he came back.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is a pretty thing, Belinda!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Pocket, returning with a\r\ncountenance expressive of grief and despair. \xe2\x80\x9cHere\xe2\x80\x99s the cook lying\r\ninsensibly drunk on the kitchen floor, with a large bundle of fresh\r\nbutter made up in the cupboard ready to sell for grease!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMrs. Pocket instantly showed much amiable emotion, and said, \xe2\x80\x9cThis is\r\nthat odious Sophia\xe2\x80\x99s doing!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean, Belinda?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded Mr. Pocket.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSophia has told you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Pocket. \xe2\x80\x9cDid I not see her with my own\r\neyes and hear her with my own ears, come into the room just now and ask\r\nto speak to you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut has she not taken me downstairs, Belinda,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Mr. Pocket,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cand shown me the woman, and the bundle too?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd do you defend her, Matthew,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs. Pocket, \xe2\x80\x9cfor making\r\nmischief?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Pocket uttered a dismal groan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAm I, grandpapa\xe2\x80\x99s granddaughter, to be nothing in the house?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mrs.\r\nPocket. \xe2\x80\x9cBesides, the cook has always been a very nice respectful woman,\r\nand said in the most natural manner when she came to look after the\r\nsituation, that she felt I was born to be a Duchess.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a sofa where Mr. Pocket stood, and he dropped upon it in the\r\nattitude of the Dying Gladiator. Still in that attitude he said, with a\r\nhollow voice, \xe2\x80\x9cGood night, Mr. Pip,\xe2\x80\x9d when I deemed it advisable to go to\r\nbed and leave him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXIV\r\n\r\nAfter two or three days, when I had established myself in my room and\r\nhad gone backwards and forwards to London several times, and had ordered\r\nall I wanted of my tradesmen, Mr. Pocket and I had a long talk together.\r\nHe knew more of my intended career than I knew myself, for he referred\r\nto his having been told by Mr. Jaggers that I was not designed for any\r\nprofession, and that I should be well enough educated for my destiny\r\nif I could \xe2\x80\x9chold my own\xe2\x80\x9d with the average of young men in prosperous\r\ncircumstances. I acquiesced, of course, knowing nothing to the contrary.\r\n\r\nHe advised my attending certain places in London, for the acquisition of\r\nsuch mere rudiments as I wanted, and my investing him with the functions\r\nof explainer and director of all my studies. He hoped that with\r\nintelligent assistance I should meet with little to discourage me, and\r\nshould soon be able to dispense with any aid but his. Through his way\r\nof saying this, and much more to similar purpose, he placed himself on\r\nconfidential terms with me in an admirable manner; and I may state\r\nat once that he was always so zealous and honorable in fulfilling his\r\ncompact with me, that he made me zealous and honorable in fulfilling\r\nmine with him. If he had shown indifference as a master, I have no doubt\r\nI should have returned the compliment as a pupil; he gave me no such\r\nexcuse, and each of us did the other justice. Nor did I ever regard\r\nhim as having anything ludicrous about him--or anything but what was\r\nserious, honest, and good--in his tutor communication with me.\r\n\r\nWhen these points were settled, and so far carried out as that I had\r\nbegun to work in earnest, it occurred to me that if I could retain my\r\nbedroom in Barnard\xe2\x80\x99s Inn, my life would be agreeably varied, while my\r\nmanners would be none the worse for Herbert\xe2\x80\x99s society. Mr. Pocket did\r\nnot object to this arrangement, but urged that before any step could\r\npossibly be taken in it, it must be submitted to my guardian. I felt\r\nthat this delicacy arose out of the consideration that the plan would\r\nsave Herbert some expense, so I went off to Little Britain and imparted\r\nmy wish to Mr. Jaggers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I could buy the furniture now hired for me,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cand one or two\r\nother little things, I should be quite at home there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGo it!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Jaggers, with a short laugh. \xe2\x80\x9cI told you you\xe2\x80\x99d get on.\r\nWell! How much do you want?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI said I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know how much.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome!\xe2\x80\x9d retorted Mr. Jaggers. \xe2\x80\x9cHow much? Fifty pounds?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, not nearly so much.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFive pounds?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Jaggers.\r\n\r\nThis was such a great fall, that I said in discomfiture, \xe2\x80\x9cO, more than\r\nthat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMore than that, eh!\xe2\x80\x9d retorted Mr. Jaggers, lying in wait for me, with\r\nhis hands in his pockets, his head on one side, and his eyes on the wall\r\nbehind me; \xe2\x80\x9chow much more?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is so difficult to fix a sum,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, hesitating.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Jaggers. \xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s get at it. Twice five; will that do?\r\nThree times five; will that do? Four times five; will that do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI said I thought that would do handsomely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFour times five will do handsomely, will it?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Jaggers,\r\nknitting his brows. \xe2\x80\x9cNow, what do you make of four times five?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do I make of it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Jaggers; \xe2\x80\x9chow much?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose you make it twenty pounds,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, smiling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind what I make it, my friend,\xe2\x80\x9d observed Mr. Jaggers, with a\r\nknowing and contradictory toss of his head. \xe2\x80\x9cI want to know what you\r\nmake it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwenty pounds, of course.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWemmick!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Jaggers, opening his office door. \xe2\x80\x9cTake Mr. Pip\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwritten order, and pay him twenty pounds.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis strongly marked way of doing business made a strongly marked\r\nimpression on me, and that not of an agreeable kind. Mr. Jaggers never\r\nlaughed; but he wore great bright creaking boots, and, in poising\r\nhimself on these boots, with his large head bent down and his eyebrows\r\njoined together, awaiting an answer, he sometimes caused the boots to\r\ncreak, as if they laughed in a dry and suspicious way. As he happened\r\nto go out now, and as Wemmick was brisk and talkative, I said to Wemmick\r\nthat I hardly knew what to make of Mr. Jaggers\xe2\x80\x99s manner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell him that, and he\xe2\x80\x99ll take it as a compliment,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Wemmick;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9che don\xe2\x80\x99t mean that you should know what to make of it.--Oh!\xe2\x80\x9d for\r\nI looked surprised, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s not personal; it\xe2\x80\x99s professional: only\r\nprofessional.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWemmick was at his desk, lunching--and crunching--on a dry hard biscuit;\r\npieces of which he threw from time to time into his slit of a mouth, as\r\nif he were posting them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlways seems to me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wemmick, \xe2\x80\x9cas if he had set a man-trap and was\r\nwatching it. Suddenly-click--you\xe2\x80\x99re caught!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWithout remarking that man-traps were not among the amenities of life, I\r\nsaid I supposed he was very skilful?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDeep,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wemmick, \xe2\x80\x9cas Australia.\xe2\x80\x9d Pointing with his pen at the\r\noffice floor, to express that Australia was understood, for the purposes\r\nof the figure, to be symmetrically on the opposite spot of the globe.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf there was anything deeper,\xe2\x80\x9d added Wemmick, bringing his pen to\r\npaper, \xe2\x80\x9che\xe2\x80\x99d be it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen, I said I supposed he had a fine business, and Wemmick said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCa-pi-tal!\xe2\x80\x9d Then I asked if there were many clerks? to which he\r\nreplied,--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe don\xe2\x80\x99t run much into clerks, because there\xe2\x80\x99s only one Jaggers, and\r\npeople won\xe2\x80\x99t have him at second hand. There are only four of us. Would\r\nyou like to see \xe2\x80\x98em? You are one of us, as I may say.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI accepted the offer. When Mr. Wemmick had put all the biscuit into the\r\npost, and had paid me my money from a cash-box in a safe, the key\r\nof which safe he kept somewhere down his back and produced from his\r\ncoat-collar like an iron-pigtail, we went upstairs. The house was dark\r\nand shabby, and the greasy shoulders that had left their mark in Mr.\r\nJaggers\xe2\x80\x99s room seemed to have been shuffling up and down the staircase\r\nfor years. In the front first floor, a clerk who looked something\r\nbetween a publican and a rat-catcher--a large pale, puffed, swollen\r\nman--was attentively engaged with three or four people of shabby\r\nappearance, whom he treated as unceremoniously as everybody seemed to\r\nbe treated who contributed to Mr. Jaggers\xe2\x80\x99s coffers. \xe2\x80\x9cGetting evidence\r\ntogether,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Wemmick, as we came out, \xe2\x80\x9cfor the Bailey.\xe2\x80\x9d In the\r\nroom over that, a little flabby terrier of a clerk with dangling hair\r\n(his cropping seemed to have been forgotten when he was a puppy) was\r\nsimilarly engaged with a man with weak eyes, whom Mr. Wemmick presented\r\nto me as a smelter who kept his pot always boiling, and who would melt\r\nme anything I pleased,--and who was in an excessive white-perspiration,\r\nas if he had been trying his art on himself. In a back room, a\r\nhigh-shouldered man with a face-ache tied up in dirty flannel, who was\r\ndressed in old black clothes that bore the appearance of having been\r\nwaxed, was stooping over his work of making fair copies of the notes of\r\nthe other two gentlemen, for Mr. Jaggers\xe2\x80\x99s own use.\r\n\r\nThis was all the establishment. When we went downstairs again, Wemmick\r\nled me into my guardian\xe2\x80\x99s room, and said, \xe2\x80\x9cThis you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen already.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPray,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, as the two odious casts with the twitchy leer upon them\r\ncaught my sight again, \xe2\x80\x9cwhose likenesses are those?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThese?\xe2\x80\x9d said Wemmick, getting upon a chair, and blowing the dust off\r\nthe horrible heads before bringing them down. \xe2\x80\x9cThese are two celebrated\r\nones. Famous clients of ours that got us a world of credit. This chap\r\n(why you must have come down in the night and been peeping into the\r\ninkstand, to get this blot upon your eyebrow, you old rascal!) murdered\r\nhis master, and, considering that he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t brought up to evidence,\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t plan it badly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it like him?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked, recoiling from the brute, as Wemmick spat\r\nupon his eyebrow and gave it a rub with his sleeve.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLike him? It\xe2\x80\x99s himself, you know. The cast was made in Newgate,\r\ndirectly after he was taken down. You had a particular fancy for\r\nme, hadn\xe2\x80\x99t you, Old Artful?\xe2\x80\x9d said Wemmick. He then explained this\r\naffectionate apostrophe, by touching his brooch representing the lady\r\nand the weeping willow at the tomb with the urn upon it, and saying,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHad it made for me, express!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs the lady anybody?\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Wemmick. \xe2\x80\x9cOnly his game. (You liked your bit of game,\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t you?) No; deuce a bit of a lady in the case, Mr. Pip, except\r\none,--and she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t of this slender lady-like sort, and you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nhave caught her looking after this urn, unless there was something to\r\ndrink in it.\xe2\x80\x9d Wemmick\xe2\x80\x99s attention being thus directed to his brooch, he\r\nput down the cast, and polished the brooch with his pocket-handkerchief.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid that other creature come to the same end?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked. \xe2\x80\x9cHe has the\r\nsame look.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re right,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wemmick; \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s the genuine look. Much as if one\r\nnostril was caught up with a horse-hair and a little fish-hook. Yes,\r\nhe came to the same end; quite the natural end here, I assure you.\r\nHe forged wills, this blade did, if he didn\xe2\x80\x99t also put the supposed\r\ntestators to sleep too. You were a gentlemanly Cove, though\xe2\x80\x9d (Mr.\r\nWemmick was again apostrophizing), \xe2\x80\x9cand you said you could write Greek.\r\nYah, Bounceable! What a liar you were! I never met such a liar as you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n Before putting his late friend on his shelf again, Wemmick touched the\r\nlargest of his mourning rings and said, \xe2\x80\x9cSent out to buy it for me, only\r\nthe day before.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhile he was putting up the other cast and coming down from the chair,\r\nthe thought crossed my mind that all his personal jewelry was derived\r\nfrom like sources. As he had shown no diffidence on the subject, I\r\nventured on the liberty of asking him the question, when he stood before\r\nme, dusting his hands.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO yes,\xe2\x80\x9d he returned, \xe2\x80\x9cthese are all gifts of that kind. One brings\r\nanother, you see; that\xe2\x80\x99s the way of it. I always take \xe2\x80\x98em. They\xe2\x80\x99re\r\ncuriosities. And they\xe2\x80\x99re property. They may not be worth much, but,\r\nafter all, they\xe2\x80\x99re property and portable. It don\xe2\x80\x99t signify to you with\r\nyour brilliant lookout, but as to myself, my guiding-star always is,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Get hold of portable property\xe2\x80\x99.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen I had rendered homage to this light, he went on to say, in a\r\nfriendly manner:--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf at any odd time when you have nothing better to do, you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nmind coming over to see me at Walworth, I could offer you a bed, and I\r\nshould consider it an honor. I have not much to show you; but such two\r\nor three curiosities as I have got you might like to look over; and I am\r\nfond of a bit of garden and a summer-house.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI said I should be delighted to accept his hospitality.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThankee,\xe2\x80\x9d said he; \xe2\x80\x9cthen we\xe2\x80\x99ll consider that it\xe2\x80\x99s to come off, when\r\nconvenient to you. Have you dined with Mr. Jaggers yet?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot yet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wemmick, \xe2\x80\x9che\xe2\x80\x99ll give you wine, and good wine. I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you\r\npunch, and not bad punch. And now I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you something. When you go\r\nto dine with Mr. Jaggers, look at his housekeeper.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShall I see something very uncommon?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wemmick, \xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99ll see a wild beast tamed. Not so very\r\nuncommon, you\xe2\x80\x99ll tell me. I reply, that depends on the original wildness\r\nof the beast, and the amount of taming. It won\xe2\x80\x99t lower your opinion of\r\nMr. Jaggers\xe2\x80\x99s powers. Keep your eye on it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI told him I would do so, with all the interest and curiosity that his\r\npreparation awakened. As I was taking my departure, he asked me if I\r\nwould like to devote five minutes to seeing Mr. Jaggers \xe2\x80\x9cat it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor several reasons, and not least because I didn\xe2\x80\x99t clearly know what\r\nMr. Jaggers would be found to be \xe2\x80\x9cat,\xe2\x80\x9d I replied in the affirmative.\r\nWe dived into the City, and came up in a crowded police-court, where\r\na blood-relation (in the murderous sense) of the deceased, with the\r\nfanciful taste in brooches, was standing at the bar, uncomfortably\r\nchewing something; while my guardian had a woman under examination or\r\ncross-examination,--I don\xe2\x80\x99t know which,--and was striking her, and\r\nthe bench, and everybody present, with awe. If anybody, of whatsoever\r\ndegree, said a word that he didn\xe2\x80\x99t approve of, he instantly required to\r\nhave it \xe2\x80\x9ctaken down.\xe2\x80\x9d If anybody wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t make an admission, he said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll have it out of you!\xe2\x80\x9d and if anybody made an admission, he said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow I have got you!\xe2\x80\x9d The magistrates shivered under a single bite of\r\nhis finger. Thieves and thief-takers hung in dread rapture on his words,\r\nand shrank when a hair of his eyebrows turned in their direction. Which\r\nside he was on I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t make out, for he seemed to me to be grinding\r\nthe whole place in a mill; I only know that when I stole out on tiptoe,\r\nhe was not on the side of the bench; for, he was making the legs of the\r\nold gentleman who presided, quite convulsive under the table, by his\r\ndenunciations of his conduct as the representative of British law and\r\njustice in that chair that day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXV\r\n\r\nBentley Drummle, who was so sulky a fellow that he even took up a book\r\nas if its writer had done him an injury, did not take up an\r\nacquaintance in a more agreeable spirit. Heavy in figure, movement,\r\nand comprehension,--in the sluggish complexion of his face, and in\r\nthe large, awkward tongue that seemed to loll about in his mouth as\r\nhe himself lolled about in a room,--he was idle, proud, niggardly,\r\nreserved, and suspicious. He came of rich people down in Somersetshire,\r\nwho had nursed this combination of qualities until they made the\r\ndiscovery that it was just of age and a blockhead. Thus, Bentley Drummle\r\nhad come to Mr. Pocket when he was a head taller than that gentleman,\r\nand half a dozen heads thicker than most gentlemen.\r\n\r\nStartop had been spoilt by a weak mother and kept at home when he\r\nought to have been at school, but he was devotedly attached to her, and\r\nadmired her beyond measure. He had a woman\xe2\x80\x99s delicacy of feature,\r\nand was--\xe2\x80\x9cas you may see, though you never saw her,\xe2\x80\x9d said Herbert to\r\nme--\xe2\x80\x9cexactly like his mother.\xe2\x80\x9d It was but natural that I should take to\r\nhim much more kindly than to Drummle, and that, even in the earliest\r\nevenings of our boating, he and I should pull homeward abreast of one\r\nanother, conversing from boat to boat, while Bentley Drummle came up\r\nin our wake alone, under the overhanging banks and among the rushes. He\r\nwould always creep in-shore like some uncomfortable amphibious creature,\r\neven when the tide would have sent him fast upon his way; and I always\r\nthink of him as coming after us in the dark or by the back-water,\r\nwhen our own two boats were breaking the sunset or the moonlight in\r\nmid-stream.\r\n\r\nHerbert was my intimate companion and friend. I presented him with a\r\nhalf-share in my boat, which was the occasion of his often coming down\r\nto Hammersmith; and my possession of a half-share in his chambers often\r\ntook me up to London. We used to walk between the two places at all\r\nhours. I have an affection for the road yet (though it is not so\r\npleasant a road as it was then), formed in the impressibility of untried\r\nyouth and hope.\r\n\r\nWhen I had been in Mr. Pocket\xe2\x80\x99s family a month or two, Mr. and Mrs.\r\nCamilla turned up. Camilla was Mr. Pocket\xe2\x80\x99s sister. Georgiana, whom I\r\nhad seen at Miss Havisham\xe2\x80\x99s on the same occasion, also turned up. She\r\nwas a cousin,--an indigestive single woman, who called her rigidity\r\nreligion, and her liver love. These people hated me with the hatred of\r\ncupidity and disappointment. As a matter of course, they fawned upon\r\nme in my prosperity with the basest meanness. Towards Mr. Pocket, as\r\na grown-up infant with no notion of his own interests, they showed the\r\ncomplacent forbearance I had heard them express. Mrs. Pocket they\r\nheld in contempt; but they allowed the poor soul to have been heavily\r\ndisappointed in life, because that shed a feeble reflected light upon\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nThese were the surroundings among which I settled down, and applied\r\nmyself to my education. I soon contracted expensive habits, and began\r\nto spend an amount of money that within a few short months I should have\r\nthought almost fabulous; but through good and evil I stuck to my books.\r\nThere was no other merit in this, than my having sense enough to feel\r\nmy deficiencies. Between Mr. Pocket and Herbert I got on fast; and, with\r\none or the other always at my elbow to give me the start I wanted, and\r\nclear obstructions out of my road, I must have been as great a dolt as\r\nDrummle if I had done less.\r\n\r\nI had not seen Mr. Wemmick for some weeks, when I thought I would write\r\nhim a note and propose to go home with him on a certain evening. He\r\nreplied that it would give him much pleasure, and that he would expect\r\nme at the office at six o\xe2\x80\x99clock. Thither I went, and there I found him,\r\nputting the key of his safe down his back as the clock struck.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you think of walking down to Walworth?\xe2\x80\x9d said he.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cif you approve.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery much,\xe2\x80\x9d was Wemmick\xe2\x80\x99s reply, \xe2\x80\x9cfor I have had my legs under the desk\r\nall day, and shall be glad to stretch them. Now, I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you what I\r\nhave got for supper, Mr. Pip. I have got a stewed steak,--which is\r\nof home preparation,--and a cold roast fowl,--which is from the\r\ncook\xe2\x80\x99s-shop. I think it\xe2\x80\x99s tender, because the master of the shop was a\r\nJuryman in some cases of ours the other day, and we let him down easy.\r\nI reminded him of it when I bought the fowl, and I said, \xe2\x80\x9cPick us out\r\na good one, old Briton, because if we had chosen to keep you in the box\r\nanother day or two, we could easily have done it.\xe2\x80\x9d He said to that,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet me make you a present of the best fowl in the shop.\xe2\x80\x9d I let him, of\r\ncourse. As far as it goes, it\xe2\x80\x99s property and portable. You don\xe2\x80\x99t object\r\nto an aged parent, I hope?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI really thought he was still speaking of the fowl, until he added,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause I have got an aged parent at my place.\xe2\x80\x9d I then said what\r\npoliteness required.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo, you haven\xe2\x80\x99t dined with Mr. Jaggers yet?\xe2\x80\x9d he pursued, as we walked\r\nalong.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot yet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe told me so this afternoon when he heard you were coming. I expect\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ll have an invitation to-morrow. He\xe2\x80\x99s going to ask your pals, too.\r\nThree of \xe2\x80\x98em; ain\xe2\x80\x99t there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAlthough I was not in the habit of counting Drummle as one of my\r\nintimate associates, I answered, \xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, he\xe2\x80\x99s going to ask the whole gang,\xe2\x80\x9d--I hardly felt complimented by\r\nthe word,--\xe2\x80\x9cand whatever he gives you, he\xe2\x80\x99ll give you good. Don\xe2\x80\x99t look\r\nforward to variety, but you\xe2\x80\x99ll have excellence. And there\xe2\x80\x99s another rum\r\nthing in his house,\xe2\x80\x9d proceeded Wemmick, after a moment\xe2\x80\x99s pause, as if\r\nthe remark followed on the housekeeper understood; \xe2\x80\x9che never lets a door\r\nor window be fastened at night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs he never robbed?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s it!\xe2\x80\x9d returned Wemmick. \xe2\x80\x9cHe says, and gives it out publicly, \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nwant to see the man who\xe2\x80\x99ll rob me.\xe2\x80\x9d Lord bless you, I have heard him, a\r\nhundred times, if I have heard him once, say to regular cracksmen in our\r\nfront office, \xe2\x80\x9cYou know where I live; now, no bolt is ever drawn there;\r\nwhy don\xe2\x80\x99t you do a stroke of business with me? Come; can\xe2\x80\x99t I tempt you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n Not a man of them, sir, would be bold enough to try it on, for love or\r\nmoney.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey dread him so much?\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDread him,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wemmick. \xe2\x80\x9cI believe you they dread him. Not but what\r\nhe\xe2\x80\x99s artful, even in his defiance of them. No silver, sir. Britannia\r\nmetal, every spoon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo they wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have much,\xe2\x80\x9d I observed, \xe2\x80\x9ceven if they--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! But he would have much,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wemmick, cutting me short, \xe2\x80\x9cand they\r\nknow it. He\xe2\x80\x99d have their lives, and the lives of scores of \xe2\x80\x98em. He\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nhave all he could get. And it\xe2\x80\x99s impossible to say what he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get,\r\nif he gave his mind to it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI was falling into meditation on my guardian\xe2\x80\x99s greatness, when Wemmick\r\nremarked:--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs to the absence of plate, that\xe2\x80\x99s only his natural depth, you know.\r\nA river\xe2\x80\x99s its natural depth, and he\xe2\x80\x99s his natural depth. Look at his\r\nwatch-chain. That\xe2\x80\x99s real enough.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s very massive,\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMassive?\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Wemmick. \xe2\x80\x9cI think so. And his watch is a gold\r\nrepeater, and worth a hundred pound if it\xe2\x80\x99s worth a penny. Mr. Pip,\r\nthere are about seven hundred thieves in this town who know all about\r\nthat watch; there\xe2\x80\x99s not a man, a woman, or a child, among them, who\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t identify the smallest link in that chain, and drop it as if it\r\nwas red hot, if inveigled into touching it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt first with such discourse, and afterwards with conversation of a more\r\ngeneral nature, did Mr. Wemmick and I beguile the time and the road,\r\nuntil he gave me to understand that we had arrived in the district of\r\nWalworth.\r\n\r\nIt appeared to be a collection of back lanes, ditches, and little\r\ngardens, and to present the aspect of a rather dull retirement.\r\nWemmick\xe2\x80\x99s house was a little wooden cottage in the midst of plots of\r\ngarden, and the top of it was cut out and painted like a battery mounted\r\nwith guns.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy own doing,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wemmick. \xe2\x80\x9cLooks pretty; don\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI highly commended it, I think it was the smallest house I ever saw;\r\nwith the queerest gothic windows (by far the greater part of them sham),\r\nand a gothic door almost too small to get in at.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s a real flagstaff, you see,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wemmick, \xe2\x80\x9cand on Sundays I\r\nrun up a real flag. Then look here. After I have crossed this bridge, I\r\nhoist it up--so--and cut off the communication.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe bridge was a plank, and it crossed a chasm about four feet wide\r\nand two deep. But it was very pleasant to see the pride with which he\r\nhoisted it up and made it fast; smiling as he did so, with a relish and\r\nnot merely mechanically.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt nine o\xe2\x80\x99clock every night, Greenwich time,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wemmick, \xe2\x80\x9cthe gun\r\nfires. There he is, you see! And when you hear him go, I think you\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nsay he\xe2\x80\x99s a Stinger.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe piece of ordnance referred to, was mounted in a separate fortress,\r\nconstructed of lattice-work. It was protected from the weather by an\r\ningenious little tarpaulin contrivance in the nature of an umbrella.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen, at the back,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wemmick, \xe2\x80\x9cout of sight, so as not to impede\r\nthe idea of fortifications,--for it\xe2\x80\x99s a principle with me, if you have\r\nan idea, carry it out and keep it up,--I don\xe2\x80\x99t know whether that\xe2\x80\x99s your\r\nopinion--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI said, decidedly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c--At the back, there\xe2\x80\x99s a pig, and there are fowls and rabbits; then,\r\nI knock together my own little frame, you see, and grow cucumbers; and\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ll judge at supper what sort of a salad I can raise. So, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nWemmick, smiling again, but seriously too, as he shook his head, \xe2\x80\x9cif you\r\ncan suppose the little place besieged, it would hold out a devil of a\r\ntime in point of provisions.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen, he conducted me to a bower about a dozen yards off, but which was\r\napproached by such ingenious twists of path that it took quite a long\r\ntime to get at; and in this retreat our glasses were already set forth.\r\nOur punch was cooling in an ornamental lake, on whose margin the bower\r\nwas raised. This piece of water (with an island in the middle which\r\nmight have been the salad for supper) was of a circular form, and he had\r\nconstructed a fountain in it, which, when you set a little mill going\r\nand took a cork out of a pipe, played to that powerful extent that it\r\nmade the back of your hand quite wet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am my own engineer, and my own carpenter, and my own plumber, and\r\nmy own gardener, and my own Jack of all Trades,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wemmick, in\r\nacknowledging my compliments. \xe2\x80\x9cWell; it\xe2\x80\x99s a good thing, you know. It\r\nbrushes the Newgate cobwebs away, and pleases the Aged. You wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nmind being at once introduced to the Aged, would you? It wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t put\r\nyou out?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI expressed the readiness I felt, and we went into the castle. There\r\nwe found, sitting by a fire, a very old man in a flannel coat: clean,\r\ncheerful, comfortable, and well cared for, but intensely deaf.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell aged parent,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wemmick, shaking hands with him in a cordial\r\nand jocose way, \xe2\x80\x9chow am you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right, John; all right!\xe2\x80\x9d replied the old man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHere\xe2\x80\x99s Mr. Pip, aged parent,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wemmick, \xe2\x80\x9cand I wish you could hear\r\nhis name. Nod away at him, Mr. Pip; that\xe2\x80\x99s what he likes. Nod away at\r\nhim, if you please, like winking!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is a fine place of my son\xe2\x80\x99s, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d cried the old man, while I\r\nnodded as hard as I possibly could. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is a pretty pleasure-ground,\r\nsir. This spot and these beautiful works upon it ought to be kept\r\ntogether by the Nation, after my son\xe2\x80\x99s time, for the people\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nenjoyment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re as proud of it as Punch; ain\xe2\x80\x99t you, Aged?\xe2\x80\x9d said Wemmick,\r\ncontemplating the old man, with his hard face really softened; \xe2\x80\x9cthere\xe2\x80\x99s\r\na nod for you;\xe2\x80\x9d giving him a tremendous one; \xe2\x80\x9cthere\xe2\x80\x99s another for you;\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n giving him a still more tremendous one; \xe2\x80\x9cyou like that, don\xe2\x80\x99t you? If\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99re not tired, Mr. Pip--though I know it\xe2\x80\x99s tiring to strangers--will\r\nyou tip him one more? You can\xe2\x80\x99t think how it pleases him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI tipped him several more, and he was in great spirits. We left him\r\nbestirring himself to feed the fowls, and we sat down to our punch in\r\nthe arbor; where Wemmick told me, as he smoked a pipe, that it had taken\r\nhim a good many years to bring the property up to its present pitch of\r\nperfection.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it your own, Mr. Wemmick?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO yes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wemmick, \xe2\x80\x9cI have got hold of it, a bit at a time. It\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nfreehold, by George!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it indeed? I hope Mr. Jaggers admires it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever seen it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wemmick. \xe2\x80\x9cNever heard of it. Never seen the Aged.\r\nNever heard of him. No; the office is one thing, and private life is\r\nanother. When I go into the office, I leave the Castle behind me, and\r\nwhen I come into the Castle, I leave the office behind me. If it\xe2\x80\x99s not\r\nin any way disagreeable to you, you\xe2\x80\x99ll oblige me by doing the same. I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t wish it professionally spoken about.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOf course I felt my good faith involved in the observance of his\r\nrequest. The punch being very nice, we sat there drinking it and\r\ntalking, until it was almost nine o\xe2\x80\x99clock. \xe2\x80\x9cGetting near gun-fire,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nWemmick then, as he laid down his pipe; \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s the Aged\xe2\x80\x99s treat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nProceeding into the Castle again, we found the Aged heating the poker,\r\nwith expectant eyes, as a preliminary to the performance of this great\r\nnightly ceremony. Wemmick stood with his watch in his hand until the\r\nmoment was come for him to take the red-hot poker from the Aged, and\r\nrepair to the battery. He took it, and went out, and presently the\r\nStinger went off with a Bang that shook the crazy little box of a\r\ncottage as if it must fall to pieces, and made every glass and teacup in\r\nit ring. Upon this, the Aged--who I believe would have been blown out\r\nof his arm-chair but for holding on by the elbows--cried out exultingly,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s fired! I heerd him!\xe2\x80\x9d and I nodded at the old gentleman until it is\r\nno figure of speech to declare that I absolutely could not see him.\r\n\r\nThe interval between that time and supper Wemmick devoted to showing\r\nme his collection of curiosities. They were mostly of a felonious\r\ncharacter; comprising the pen with which a celebrated forgery had been\r\ncommitted, a distinguished razor or two, some locks of hair, and several\r\nmanuscript confessions written under condemnation,--upon which Mr.\r\nWemmick set particular value as being, to use his own words, \xe2\x80\x9cevery one\r\nof \xe2\x80\x98em Lies, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d These were agreeably dispersed among small specimens\r\nof china and glass, various neat trifles made by the proprietor of the\r\nmuseum, and some tobacco-stoppers carved by the Aged. They were all\r\ndisplayed in that chamber of the Castle into which I had been first\r\ninducted, and which served, not only as the general sitting-room but\r\nas the kitchen too, if I might judge from a saucepan on the hob, and\r\na brazen bijou over the fireplace designed for the suspension of a\r\nroasting-jack.\r\n\r\nThere was a neat little girl in attendance, who looked after the Aged in\r\nthe day. When she had laid the supper-cloth, the bridge was lowered to\r\ngive her means of egress, and she withdrew for the night. The supper was\r\nexcellent; and though the Castle was rather subject to dry-rot insomuch\r\nthat it tasted like a bad nut, and though the pig might have been\r\nfarther off, I was heartily pleased with my whole entertainment. Nor was\r\nthere any drawback on my little turret bedroom, beyond there being such\r\na very thin ceiling between me and the flagstaff, that when I lay down\r\non my back in bed, it seemed as if I had to balance that pole on my\r\nforehead all night.\r\n\r\nWemmick was up early in the morning, and I am afraid I heard him\r\ncleaning my boots. After that, he fell to gardening, and I saw him from\r\nmy gothic window pretending to employ the Aged, and nodding at him in\r\na most devoted manner. Our breakfast was as good as the supper, and at\r\nhalf-past eight precisely we started for Little Britain. By degrees,\r\nWemmick got dryer and harder as we went along, and his mouth tightened\r\ninto a post-office again. At last, when we got to his place of business\r\nand he pulled out his key from his coat-collar, he looked as unconscious\r\nof his Walworth property as if the Castle and the drawbridge and the\r\narbor and the lake and the fountain and the Aged, had all been blown\r\ninto space together by the last discharge of the Stinger.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXVI\r\n\r\nIt fell out as Wemmick had told me it would, that I had an early\r\nopportunity of comparing my guardian\xe2\x80\x99s establishment with that of his\r\ncashier and clerk. My guardian was in his room, washing his hands with\r\nhis scented soap, when I went into the office from Walworth; and he\r\ncalled me to him, and gave me the invitation for myself and friends\r\nwhich Wemmick had prepared me to receive. \xe2\x80\x9cNo ceremony,\xe2\x80\x9d he stipulated,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cand no dinner dress, and say to-morrow.\xe2\x80\x9d I asked him where we should\r\ncome to (for I had no idea where he lived), and I believe it was in his\r\ngeneral objection to make anything like an admission, that he replied,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome here, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll take you home with me.\xe2\x80\x9d I embrace this opportunity\r\nof remarking that he washed his clients off, as if he were a surgeon or\r\na dentist. He had a closet in his room, fitted up for the purpose, which\r\nsmelt of the scented soap like a perfumer\xe2\x80\x99s shop. It had an unusually\r\nlarge jack-towel on a roller inside the door, and he would wash his\r\nhands, and wipe them and dry them all over this towel, whenever he came\r\nin from a police court or dismissed a client from his room. When I and\r\nmy friends repaired to him at six o\xe2\x80\x99clock next day, he seemed to have\r\nbeen engaged on a case of a darker complexion than usual, for we found\r\nhim with his head butted into this closet, not only washing his hands,\r\nbut laving his face and gargling his throat. And even when he had\r\ndone all that, and had gone all round the jack-towel, he took out his\r\npenknife and scraped the case out of his nails before he put his coat\r\non.\r\n\r\nThere were some people slinking about as usual when we passed out into\r\nthe street, who were evidently anxious to speak with him; but there was\r\nsomething so conclusive in the halo of scented soap which encircled\r\nhis presence, that they gave it up for that day. As we walked along\r\nwestward, he was recognized ever and again by some face in the crowd of\r\nthe streets, and whenever that happened he talked louder to me; but\r\nhe never otherwise recognized anybody, or took notice that anybody\r\nrecognized him.\r\n\r\nHe conducted us to Gerrard Street, Soho, to a house on the south side of\r\nthat street. Rather a stately house of its kind, but dolefully in want\r\nof painting, and with dirty windows. He took out his key and opened the\r\ndoor, and we all went into a stone hall, bare, gloomy, and little used.\r\nSo, up a dark brown staircase into a series of three dark brown rooms on\r\nthe first floor. There were carved garlands on the panelled walls, and\r\nas he stood among them giving us welcome, I know what kind of loops I\r\nthought they looked like.\r\n\r\nDinner was laid in the best of these rooms; the second was his\r\ndressing-room; the third, his bedroom. He told us that he held the whole\r\nhouse, but rarely used more of it than we saw. The table was comfortably\r\nlaid--no silver in the service, of course--and at the side of his chair\r\nwas a capacious dumb-waiter, with a variety of bottles and decanters on\r\nit, and four dishes of fruit for dessert. I noticed throughout, that he\r\nkept everything under his own hand, and distributed everything himself.\r\n\r\nThere was a bookcase in the room; I saw from the backs of the books,\r\nthat they were about evidence, criminal law, criminal biography, trials,\r\nacts of Parliament, and such things. The furniture was all very solid\r\nand good, like his watch-chain. It had an official look, however, and\r\nthere was nothing merely ornamental to be seen. In a corner was a little\r\ntable of papers with a shaded lamp: so that he seemed to bring the\r\noffice home with him in that respect too, and to wheel it out of an\r\nevening and fall to work.\r\n\r\nAs he had scarcely seen my three companions until now,--for he and I had\r\nwalked together,--he stood on the hearth-rug, after ringing the bell,\r\nand took a searching look at them. To my surprise, he seemed at once to\r\nbe principally if not solely interested in Drummle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPip,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, putting his large hand on my shoulder and moving me to\r\nthe window, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know one from the other. Who\xe2\x80\x99s the Spider?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe spider?\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe blotchy, sprawly, sulky fellow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s Bentley Drummle,\xe2\x80\x9d I replied; \xe2\x80\x9cthe one with the delicate face is\r\nStartop.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNot making the least account of \xe2\x80\x9cthe one with the delicate face,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nreturned, \xe2\x80\x9cBentley Drummle is his name, is it? I like the look of that\r\nfellow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe immediately began to talk to Drummle: not at all deterred by his\r\nreplying in his heavy reticent way, but apparently led on by it to screw\r\ndiscourse out of him. I was looking at the two, when there came between\r\nme and them the housekeeper, with the first dish for the table.\r\n\r\nShe was a woman of about forty, I supposed,--but I may have thought her\r\nyounger than she was. Rather tall, of a lithe nimble figure, extremely\r\npale, with large faded eyes, and a quantity of streaming hair. I cannot\r\nsay whether any diseased affection of the heart caused her lips to be\r\nparted as if she were panting, and her face to bear a curious expression\r\nof suddenness and flutter; but I know that I had been to see Macbeth at\r\nthe theatre, a night or two before, and that her face looked to me as if\r\nit were all disturbed by fiery air, like the faces I had seen rise out\r\nof the Witches\xe2\x80\x99 caldron.\r\n\r\nShe set the dish on, touched my guardian quietly on the arm with a\r\nfinger to notify that dinner was ready, and vanished. We took our seats\r\nat the round table, and my guardian kept Drummle on one side of him,\r\nwhile Startop sat on the other. It was a noble dish of fish that the\r\nhousekeeper had put on table, and we had a joint of equally choice\r\nmutton afterwards, and then an equally choice bird. Sauces, wines, all\r\nthe accessories we wanted, and all of the best, were given out by our\r\nhost from his dumb-waiter; and when they had made the circuit of the\r\ntable, he always put them back again. Similarly, he dealt us clean\r\nplates and knives and forks, for each course, and dropped those just\r\ndisused into two baskets on the ground by his chair. No other attendant\r\nthan the housekeeper appeared. She set on every dish; and I always saw\r\nin her face, a face rising out of the caldron. Years afterwards, I made\r\na dreadful likeness of that woman, by causing a face that had no other\r\nnatural resemblance to it than it derived from flowing hair to pass\r\nbehind a bowl of flaming spirits in a dark room.\r\n\r\nInduced to take particular notice of the housekeeper, both by her\r\nown striking appearance and by Wemmick\xe2\x80\x99s preparation, I observed\r\nthat whenever she was in the room she kept her eyes attentively on my\r\nguardian, and that she would remove her hands from any dish she put\r\nbefore him, hesitatingly, as if she dreaded his calling her back, and\r\nwanted him to speak when she was nigh, if he had anything to say. I\r\nfancied that I could detect in his manner a consciousness of this, and a\r\npurpose of always holding her in suspense.\r\n\r\nDinner went off gayly, and although my guardian seemed to follow rather\r\nthan originate subjects, I knew that he wrenched the weakest part of\r\nour dispositions out of us. For myself, I found that I was expressing my\r\ntendency to lavish expenditure, and to patronize Herbert, and to boast\r\nof my great prospects, before I quite knew that I had opened my lips.\r\nIt was so with all of us, but with no one more than Drummle: the\r\ndevelopment of whose inclination to gird in a grudging and suspicious\r\nway at the rest, was screwed out of him before the fish was taken off.\r\n\r\nIt was not then, but when we had got to the cheese, that our\r\nconversation turned upon our rowing feats, and that Drummle was rallied\r\nfor coming up behind of a night in that slow amphibious way of his.\r\nDrummle upon this, informed our host that he much preferred our room to\r\nour company, and that as to skill he was more than our master, and that\r\nas to strength he could scatter us like chaff. By some invisible agency,\r\nmy guardian wound him up to a pitch little short of ferocity about this\r\ntrifle; and he fell to baring and spanning his arm to show how muscular\r\nit was, and we all fell to baring and spanning our arms in a ridiculous\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\nNow the housekeeper was at that time clearing the table; my guardian,\r\ntaking no heed of her, but with the side of his face turned from her,\r\nwas leaning back in his chair biting the side of his forefinger and\r\nshowing an interest in Drummle, that, to me, was quite inexplicable.\r\nSuddenly, he clapped his large hand on the housekeeper\xe2\x80\x99s, like a trap,\r\nas she stretched it across the table. So suddenly and smartly did he do\r\nthis, that we all stopped in our foolish contention.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you talk of strength,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Jaggers, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll show you a wrist.\r\nMolly, let them see your wrist.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer entrapped hand was on the table, but she had already put her other\r\nhand behind her waist. \xe2\x80\x9cMaster,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, in a low voice, with her eyes\r\nattentively and entreatingly fixed upon him. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll show you a wrist,\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Mr. Jaggers, with an immovable\r\ndetermination to show it. \xe2\x80\x9cMolly, let them see your wrist.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMaster,\xe2\x80\x9d she again murmured. \xe2\x80\x9cPlease!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMolly,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Jaggers, not looking at her, but obstinately looking\r\nat the opposite side of the room, \xe2\x80\x9clet them see both your wrists. Show\r\nthem. Come!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe took his hand from hers, and turned that wrist up on the table. She\r\nbrought her other hand from behind her, and held the two out side by\r\nside. The last wrist was much disfigured,--deeply scarred and scarred\r\nacross and across. When she held her hands out she took her eyes from\r\nMr. Jaggers, and turned them watchfully on every one of the rest of us\r\nin succession.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s power here,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Jaggers, coolly tracing out the sinews\r\nwith his forefinger. \xe2\x80\x9cVery few men have the power of wrist that this\r\nwoman has. It\xe2\x80\x99s remarkable what mere force of grip there is in these\r\nhands. I have had occasion to notice many hands; but I never saw\r\nstronger in that respect, man\xe2\x80\x99s or woman\xe2\x80\x99s, than these.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhile he said these words in a leisurely, critical style, she continued\r\nto look at every one of us in regular succession as we sat. The moment\r\nhe ceased, she looked at him again. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99ll do, Molly,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr.\r\nJaggers, giving her a slight nod; \xe2\x80\x9cyou have been admired, and can\r\ngo.\xe2\x80\x9d She withdrew her hands and went out of the room, and Mr. Jaggers,\r\nputting the decanters on from his dumb-waiter, filled his glass and\r\npassed round the wine.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt half-past nine, gentlemen,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cwe must break up. Pray make\r\nthe best use of your time. I am glad to see you all. Mr. Drummle, I\r\ndrink to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIf his object in singling out Drummle were to bring him out still more,\r\nit perfectly succeeded. In a sulky triumph, Drummle showed his morose\r\ndepreciation of the rest of us, in a more and more offensive degree,\r\nuntil he became downright intolerable. Through all his stages, Mr.\r\nJaggers followed him with the same strange interest. He actually seemed\r\nto serve as a zest to Mr. Jaggers\xe2\x80\x99s wine.\r\n\r\nIn our boyish want of discretion I dare say we took too much to drink,\r\nand I know we talked too much. We became particularly hot upon some\r\nboorish sneer of Drummle\xe2\x80\x99s, to the effect that we were too free with our\r\nmoney. It led to my remarking, with more zeal than discretion, that it\r\ncame with a bad grace from him, to whom Startop had lent money in my\r\npresence but a week or so before.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d retorted Drummle; \xe2\x80\x9che\xe2\x80\x99ll be paid.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t mean to imply that he won\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cbut it might make you\r\nhold your tongue about us and our money, I should think.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou should think!\xe2\x80\x9d retorted Drummle. \xe2\x80\x9cOh Lord!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI dare say,\xe2\x80\x9d I went on, meaning to be very severe, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nlend money to any of us if we wanted it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are right,\xe2\x80\x9d said Drummle. \xe2\x80\x9cI wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t lend one of you a sixpence. I\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t lend anybody a sixpence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRather mean to borrow under those circumstances, I should say.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou should say,\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Drummle. \xe2\x80\x9cOh Lord!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis was so very aggravating--the more especially as I found myself\r\nmaking no way against his surly obtuseness--that I said, disregarding\r\nHerbert\xe2\x80\x99s efforts to check me,--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, Mr. Drummle, since we are on the subject, I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you what\r\npassed between Herbert here and me, when you borrowed that money.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want to know what passed between Herbert there and you,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n growled Drummle. And I think he added in a lower growl, that we might\r\nboth go to the devil and shake ourselves.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you, however,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cwhether you want to know or not. We\r\nsaid that as you put it in your pocket very glad to get it, you seemed\r\nto be immensely amused at his being so weak as to lend it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nDrummle laughed outright, and sat laughing in our faces, with his hands\r\nin his pockets and his round shoulders raised; plainly signifying that\r\nit was quite true, and that he despised us as asses all.\r\n\r\nHereupon Startop took him in hand, though with a much better grace than\r\nI had shown, and exhorted him to be a little more agreeable. Startop,\r\nbeing a lively, bright young fellow, and Drummle being the exact\r\nopposite, the latter was always disposed to resent him as a direct\r\npersonal affront. He now retorted in a coarse, lumpish way, and Startop\r\ntried to turn the discussion aside with some small pleasantry that made\r\nus all laugh. Resenting this little success more than anything, Drummle,\r\nwithout any threat or warning, pulled his hands out of his pockets,\r\ndropped his round shoulders, swore, took up a large glass, and would\r\nhave flung it at his adversary\xe2\x80\x99s head, but for our entertainer\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndexterously seizing it at the instant when it was raised for that\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGentlemen,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Jaggers, deliberately putting down the glass, and\r\nhauling out his gold repeater by its massive chain, \xe2\x80\x9cI am exceedingly\r\nsorry to announce that it\xe2\x80\x99s half past nine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOn this hint we all rose to depart. Before we got to the street door,\r\nStartop was cheerily calling Drummle \xe2\x80\x9cold boy,\xe2\x80\x9d as if nothing had\r\nhappened. But the old boy was so far from responding, that he would not\r\neven walk to Hammersmith on the same side of the way; so Herbert and I,\r\nwho remained in town, saw them going down the street on opposite sides;\r\nStartop leading, and Drummle lagging behind in the shadow of the houses,\r\nmuch as he was wont to follow in his boat.\r\n\r\nAs the door was not yet shut, I thought I would leave Herbert there for\r\na moment, and run upstairs again to say a word to my guardian. I found\r\nhim in his dressing-room surrounded by his stock of boots, already hard\r\nat it, washing his hands of us.\r\n\r\nI told him I had come up again to say how sorry I was that anything\r\ndisagreeable should have occurred, and that I hoped he would not blame\r\nme much.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPooh!\xe2\x80\x9d said he, sluicing his face, and speaking through the\r\nwater-drops; \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s nothing, Pip. I like that Spider though.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had turned towards me now, and was shaking his head, and blowing, and\r\ntowelling himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am glad you like him, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said I--\xe2\x80\x9cbut I don\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no,\xe2\x80\x9d my guardian assented; \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t have too much to do with him.\r\nKeep as clear of him as you can. But I like the fellow, Pip; he is one\r\nof the true sort. Why, if I was a fortune-teller--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLooking out of the towel, he caught my eye.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I am not a fortune-teller,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, letting his head drop into a\r\nfestoon of towel, and towelling away at his two ears. \xe2\x80\x9cYou know what I\r\nam, don\xe2\x80\x99t you? Good night, Pip.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood night, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn about a month after that, the Spider\xe2\x80\x99s time with Mr. Pocket was up\r\nfor good, and, to the great relief of all the house but Mrs. Pocket, he\r\nwent home to the family hole.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXVII\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMY DEAR MR PIP:--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI write this by request of Mr. Gargery, for to let you know that he\r\nis going to London in company with Mr. Wopsle and would be glad if\r\nagreeable to be allowed to see you. He would call at Barnard\xe2\x80\x99s Hotel\r\nTuesday morning at nine o\xe2\x80\x99clock, when if not agreeable please leave\r\nword. Your poor sister is much the same as when you left. We talk of you\r\nin the kitchen every night, and wonder what you are saying and doing. If\r\nnow considered in the light of a liberty, excuse it for the love of\r\npoor old days. No more, dear Mr. Pip, from your ever obliged, and\r\naffectionate servant,\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBIDDY.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cP.S. He wishes me most particular to write what larks. He says you will\r\nunderstand. I hope and do not doubt it will be agreeable to see him,\r\neven though a gentleman, for you had ever a good heart, and he is a\r\nworthy, worthy man. I have read him all, excepting only the last little\r\nsentence, and he wishes me most particular to write again what larks.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI received this letter by the post on Monday morning, and therefore its\r\nappointment was for next day. Let me confess exactly with what feelings\r\nI looked forward to Joe\xe2\x80\x99s coming.\r\n\r\nNot with pleasure, though I was bound to him by so many ties; no;\r\nwith considerable disturbance, some mortification, and a keen sense of\r\nincongruity. If I could have kept him away by paying money, I certainly\r\nwould have paid money. My greatest reassurance was that he was coming\r\nto Barnard\xe2\x80\x99s Inn, not to Hammersmith, and consequently would not fall\r\nin Bentley Drummle\xe2\x80\x99s way. I had little objection to his being seen by\r\nHerbert or his father, for both of whom I had a respect; but I had the\r\nsharpest sensitiveness as to his being seen by Drummle, whom I held in\r\ncontempt. So, throughout life, our worst weaknesses and meannesses are\r\nusually committed for the sake of the people whom we most despise.\r\n\r\nI had begun to be always decorating the chambers in some quite\r\nunnecessary and inappropriate way or other, and very expensive those\r\nwrestles with Barnard proved to be. By this time, the rooms were\r\nvastly different from what I had found them, and I enjoyed the honor\r\nof occupying a few prominent pages in the books of a neighboring\r\nupholsterer. I had got on so fast of late, that I had even started a boy\r\nin boots,--top boots,--in bondage and slavery to whom I might have been\r\nsaid to pass my days. For, after I had made the monster (out of the\r\nrefuse of my washerwoman\xe2\x80\x99s family), and had clothed him with a blue\r\ncoat, canary waistcoat, white cravat, creamy breeches, and the boots\r\nalready mentioned, I had to find him a little to do and a great deal\r\nto eat; and with both of those horrible requirements he haunted my\r\nexistence.\r\n\r\nThis avenging phantom was ordered to be on duty at eight on Tuesday\r\nmorning in the hall, (it was two feet square, as charged for\r\nfloorcloth,) and Herbert suggested certain things for breakfast that he\r\nthought Joe would like. While I felt sincerely obliged to him for being\r\nso interested and considerate, I had an odd half-provoked sense of\r\nsuspicion upon me, that if Joe had been coming to see him, he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nhave been quite so brisk about it.\r\n\r\nHowever, I came into town on the Monday night to be ready for Joe, and\r\nI got up early in the morning, and caused the sitting-room and\r\nbreakfast-table to assume their most splendid appearance. Unfortunately\r\nthe morning was drizzly, and an angel could not have concealed the fact\r\nthat Barnard was shedding sooty tears outside the window, like some weak\r\ngiant of a Sweep.\r\n\r\nAs the time approached I should have liked to run away, but the Avenger\r\npursuant to orders was in the hall, and presently I heard Joe on\r\nthe staircase. I knew it was Joe, by his clumsy manner of coming upstairs,\r\n--his state boots being always too big for him,--and by the time\r\nit took him to read the names on the other floors in the course of\r\nhis ascent. When at last he stopped outside our door, I could hear his\r\nfinger tracing over the painted letters of my name, and I afterwards\r\ndistinctly heard him breathing in at the keyhole. Finally he gave a\r\nfaint single rap, and Pepper--such was the compromising name of the\r\navenging boy--announced \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Gargery!\xe2\x80\x9d I thought he never would have\r\ndone wiping his feet, and that I must have gone out to lift him off the\r\nmat, but at last he came in.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJoe, how are you, Joe?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPip, how AIR you, Pip?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith his good honest face all glowing and shining, and his hat put\r\ndown on the floor between us, he caught both my hands and worked them\r\nstraight up and down, as if I had been the last-patented Pump.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am glad to see you, Joe. Give me your hat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut Joe, taking it up carefully with both hands, like a bird\xe2\x80\x99s-nest with\r\neggs in it, wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t hear of parting with that piece of property, and\r\npersisted in standing talking over it in a most uncomfortable way.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhich you have that growed,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe, \xe2\x80\x9cand that swelled, and that\r\ngentle-folked;\xe2\x80\x9d Joe considered a little before he discovered this word;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cas to be sure you are a honor to your king and country.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you, Joe, look wonderfully well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank God,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m ekerval to most. And your sister, she\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nno worse than she were. And Biddy, she\xe2\x80\x99s ever right and ready. And all\r\nfriends is no backerder, if not no forarder. \xe2\x80\x98Ceptin Wopsle; he\xe2\x80\x99s had a\r\ndrop.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAll this time (still with both hands taking great care of the\r\nbird\xe2\x80\x99s-nest), Joe was rolling his eyes round and round the room, and\r\nround and round the flowered pattern of my dressing-gown.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHad a drop, Joe?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy yes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe, lowering his voice, \xe2\x80\x9che\xe2\x80\x99s left the Church and went\r\ninto the playacting. Which the playacting have likeways brought him\r\nto London along with me. And his wish were,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe, getting the\r\nbird\xe2\x80\x99s-nest under his left arm for the moment, and groping in it for an\r\negg with his right; \xe2\x80\x9cif no offence, as I would \xe2\x80\x98and you that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI took what Joe gave me, and found it to be the crumpled play-bill of\r\na small metropolitan theatre, announcing the first appearance, in that\r\nvery week, of \xe2\x80\x9cthe celebrated Provincial Amateur of Roscian renown,\r\nwhose unique performance in the highest tragic walk of our National Bard\r\nhas lately occasioned so great a sensation in local dramatic circles.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWere you at his performance, Joe?\xe2\x80\x9d I inquired.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI were,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe, with emphasis and solemnity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWas there a great sensation?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe, \xe2\x80\x9cyes, there certainly were a peck of orange-peel.\r\nPartickler when he see the ghost. Though I put it to yourself, sir,\r\nwhether it were calc\xe2\x80\x99lated to keep a man up to his work with a good\r\nhart, to be continiwally cutting in betwixt him and the Ghost with\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAmen!\xe2\x80\x9d A man may have had a misfortun\xe2\x80\x99 and been in the Church,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nJoe, lowering his voice to an argumentative and feeling tone, \xe2\x80\x9cbut\r\nthat is no reason why you should put him out at such a time. Which I\r\nmeantersay, if the ghost of a man\xe2\x80\x99s own father cannot be allowed to\r\nclaim his attention, what can, Sir? Still more, when his mourning \xe2\x80\x98at\r\nis unfortunately made so small as that the weight of the black feathers\r\nbrings it off, try to keep it on how you may.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA ghost-seeing effect in Joe\xe2\x80\x99s own countenance informed me that Herbert\r\nhad entered the room. So, I presented Joe to Herbert, who held out his\r\nhand; but Joe backed from it, and held on by the bird\xe2\x80\x99s-nest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour servant, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe, \xe2\x80\x9cwhich I hope as you and Pip\xe2\x80\x9d--here his\r\neye fell on the Avenger, who was putting some toast on table, and so\r\nplainly denoted an intention to make that young gentleman one of the\r\nfamily, that I frowned it down and confused him more--\xe2\x80\x9cI meantersay, you\r\ntwo gentlemen,--which I hope as you get your elths in this close spot?\r\nFor the present may be a werry good inn, according to London opinions,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n said Joe, confidentially, \xe2\x80\x9cand I believe its character do stand it; but I\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t keep a pig in it myself,--not in the case that I wished him to\r\nfatten wholesome and to eat with a meller flavor on him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHaving borne this flattering testimony to the merits of our\r\ndwelling-place, and having incidentally shown this tendency to call me\r\n\xe2\x80\x9csir,\xe2\x80\x9d Joe, being invited to sit down to table, looked all round the\r\nroom for a suitable spot on which to deposit his hat,--as if it were\r\nonly on some very few rare substances in nature that it could find a\r\nresting place,--and ultimately stood it on an extreme corner of the\r\nchimney-piece, from which it ever afterwards fell off at intervals.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you take tea, or coffee, Mr. Gargery?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Herbert, who always\r\npresided of a morning.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThankee, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe, stiff from head to foot, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll take whichever\r\nis most agreeable to yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you say to coffee?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThankee, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Joe, evidently dispirited by the proposal,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9csince you are so kind as make chice of coffee, I will not run contrairy\r\nto your own opinions. But don\xe2\x80\x99t you never find it a little \xe2\x80\x98eating?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSay tea then,\xe2\x80\x9d said Herbert, pouring it out.\r\n\r\nHere Joe\xe2\x80\x99s hat tumbled off the mantel-piece, and he started out of his\r\nchair and picked it up, and fitted it to the same exact spot. As if it\r\nwere an absolute point of good breeding that it should tumble off again\r\nsoon.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen did you come to town, Mr. Gargery?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWere it yesterday afternoon?\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe, after coughing behind his hand,\r\nas if he had had time to catch the whooping-cough since he came. \xe2\x80\x9cNo\r\nit were not. Yes it were. Yes. It were yesterday afternoon\xe2\x80\x9d (with an\r\nappearance of mingled wisdom, relief, and strict impartiality).\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you seen anything of London yet?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, yes, Sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe, \xe2\x80\x9cme and Wopsle went off straight to look at\r\nthe Blacking Ware\xe2\x80\x99us. But we didn\xe2\x80\x99t find that it come up to its likeness\r\nin the red bills at the shop doors; which I meantersay,\xe2\x80\x9d added Joe, in\r\nan explanatory manner, \xe2\x80\x9cas it is there drawd too architectooralooral.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI really believe Joe would have prolonged this word (mightily expressive\r\nto my mind of some architecture that I know) into a perfect Chorus, but\r\nfor his attention being providentially attracted by his hat, which\r\nwas toppling. Indeed, it demanded from him a constant attention, and a\r\nquickness of eye and hand, very like that exacted by wicket-keeping.\r\nHe made extraordinary play with it, and showed the greatest skill; now,\r\nrushing at it and catching it neatly as it dropped; now, merely stopping\r\nit midway, beating it up, and humoring it in various parts of the room\r\nand against a good deal of the pattern of the paper on the wall,\r\nbefore he felt it safe to close with it; finally splashing it into the\r\nslop-basin, where I took the liberty of laying hands upon it.\r\n\r\nAs to his shirt-collar, and his coat-collar, they were perplexing to\r\nreflect upon,--insoluble mysteries both. Why should a man scrape himself\r\nto that extent, before he could consider himself full dressed? Why\r\nshould he suppose it necessary to be purified by suffering for\r\nhis holiday clothes? Then he fell into such unaccountable fits of\r\nmeditation, with his fork midway between his plate and his mouth; had\r\nhis eyes attracted in such strange directions; was afflicted with such\r\nremarkable coughs; sat so far from the table, and dropped so much\r\nmore than he ate, and pretended that he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t dropped it; that I was\r\nheartily glad when Herbert left us for the City.\r\n\r\nI had neither the good sense nor the good feeling to know that this was\r\nall my fault, and that if I had been easier with Joe, Joe would have\r\nbeen easier with me. I felt impatient of him and out of temper with him;\r\nin which condition he heaped coals of fire on my head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUs two being now alone, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d--began Joe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJoe,\xe2\x80\x9d I interrupted, pettishly, \xe2\x80\x9chow can you call me, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJoe looked at me for a single instant with something faintly like\r\nreproach. Utterly preposterous as his cravat was, and as his collars\r\nwere, I was conscious of a sort of dignity in the look.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUs two being now alone,\xe2\x80\x9d resumed Joe, \xe2\x80\x9cand me having the intentions and\r\nabilities to stay not many minutes more, I will now conclude--leastways\r\nbegin--to mention what have led to my having had the present honor. For\r\nwas it not,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe, with his old air of lucid exposition, \xe2\x80\x9cthat my\r\nonly wish were to be useful to you, I should not have had the honor of\r\nbreaking wittles in the company and abode of gentlemen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI was so unwilling to see the look again, that I made no remonstrance\r\nagainst this tone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued Joe, \xe2\x80\x9cthis is how it were. I were at the Bargemen\r\nt\xe2\x80\x99other night, Pip;\xe2\x80\x9d--whenever he subsided into affection, he called me\r\nPip, and whenever he relapsed into politeness he called me sir; \xe2\x80\x9cwhen\r\nthere come up in his shay-cart, Pumblechook. Which that same identical,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n said Joe, going down a new track, \xe2\x80\x9cdo comb my \xe2\x80\x98air the wrong way\r\nsometimes, awful, by giving out up and down town as it were him which\r\never had your infant companionation and were looked upon as a playfellow\r\nby yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNonsense. It was you, Joe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhich I fully believed it were, Pip,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe, slightly tossing\r\nhis head, \xe2\x80\x9cthough it signify little now, sir. Well, Pip; this same\r\nidentical, which his manners is given to blusterous, come to me at\r\nthe Bargemen (wot a pipe and a pint of beer do give refreshment to the\r\nworkingman, sir, and do not over stimilate), and his word were, \xe2\x80\x98Joseph,\r\nMiss Havisham she wish to speak to you.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Havisham, Joe?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98She wish,\xe2\x80\x99 were Pumblechook\xe2\x80\x99s word, \xe2\x80\x98to speak to you.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d Joe sat and\r\nrolled his eyes at the ceiling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Joe? Go on, please.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNext day, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe, looking at me as if I were a long way off,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9chaving cleaned myself, I go and I see Miss A.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss A., Joe? Miss Havisham?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhich I say, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Joe, with an air of legal formality, as if\r\nhe were making his will, \xe2\x80\x9cMiss A., or otherways Havisham. Her expression\r\nair then as follering: \xe2\x80\x98Mr. Gargery. You air in correspondence with Mr.\r\nPip?\xe2\x80\x99 Having had a letter from you, I were able to say \xe2\x80\x98I am.\xe2\x80\x99 (When\r\nI married your sister, sir, I said \xe2\x80\x98I will;\xe2\x80\x99 and when I answered your\r\nfriend, Pip, I said \xe2\x80\x98I am.\xe2\x80\x99) \xe2\x80\x98Would you tell him, then,\xe2\x80\x99 said she, \xe2\x80\x98that\r\nwhich Estella has come home and would be glad to see him.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI felt my face fire up as I looked at Joe. I hope one remote cause\r\nof its firing may have been my consciousness that if I had known his\r\nerrand, I should have given him more encouragement.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBiddy,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued Joe, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen I got home and asked her fur to write the\r\nmessage to you, a little hung back. Biddy says, \xe2\x80\x98I know he will be very\r\nglad to have it by word of mouth, it is holiday time, you want to see\r\nhim, go!\xe2\x80\x99 I have now concluded, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe, rising from his chair,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cand, Pip, I wish you ever well and ever prospering to a greater and a\r\ngreater height.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you are not going now, Joe?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes I am,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you are coming back to dinner, Joe?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo I am not,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe.\r\n\r\nOur eyes met, and all the \xe2\x80\x9cSir\xe2\x80\x9d melted out of that manly heart as he gave\r\nme his hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPip, dear old chap, life is made of ever so many partings welded\r\ntogether, as I may say, and one man\xe2\x80\x99s a blacksmith, and one\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nwhitesmith, and one\xe2\x80\x99s a goldsmith, and one\xe2\x80\x99s a coppersmith. Diwisions\r\namong such must come, and must be met as they come. If there\xe2\x80\x99s been\r\nany fault at all to-day, it\xe2\x80\x99s mine. You and me is not two figures to\r\nbe together in London; nor yet anywheres else but what is private, and\r\nbeknown, and understood among friends. It ain\xe2\x80\x99t that I am proud, but\r\nthat I want to be right, as you shall never see me no more in these\r\nclothes. I\xe2\x80\x99m wrong in these clothes. I\xe2\x80\x99m wrong out of the forge, the\r\nkitchen, or off th\xe2\x80\x99 meshes. You won\xe2\x80\x99t find half so much fault in me if\r\nyou think of me in my forge dress, with my hammer in my hand, or even\r\nmy pipe. You won\xe2\x80\x99t find half so much fault in me if, supposing as you\r\nshould ever wish to see me, you come and put your head in at the forge\r\nwindow and see Joe the blacksmith, there, at the old anvil, in the old\r\nburnt apron, sticking to the old work. I\xe2\x80\x99m awful dull, but I hope I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\nbeat out something nigh the rights of this at last. And so GOD bless\r\nyou, dear old Pip, old chap, GOD bless you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI had not been mistaken in my fancy that there was a simple dignity\r\nin him. The fashion of his dress could no more come in its way when he\r\nspoke these words than it could come in its way in Heaven. He touched me\r\ngently on the forehead, and went out. As soon as I could recover\r\nmyself sufficiently, I hurried out after him and looked for him in the\r\nneighboring streets; but he was gone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXVIII\r\n\r\nIt was clear that I must repair to our town next day, and in the first\r\nflow of my repentance, it was equally clear that I must stay at Joe\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\nBut, when I had secured my box-place by to-morrow\xe2\x80\x99s coach, and had been\r\ndown to Mr. Pocket\xe2\x80\x99s and back, I was not by any means convinced on the\r\nlast point, and began to invent reasons and make excuses for putting\r\nup at the Blue Boar. I should be an inconvenience at Joe\xe2\x80\x99s; I was not\r\nexpected, and my bed would not be ready; I should be too far from\r\nMiss Havisham\xe2\x80\x99s, and she was exacting and mightn\xe2\x80\x99t like it. All other\r\nswindlers upon earth are nothing to the self-swindlers, and with such\r\npretences did I cheat myself. Surely a curious thing. That I should\r\ninnocently take a bad half-crown of somebody else\xe2\x80\x99s manufacture is\r\nreasonable enough; but that I should knowingly reckon the spurious coin\r\nof my own make as good money! An obliging stranger, under pretence of\r\ncompactly folding up my bank-notes for security\xe2\x80\x99s sake, abstracts the\r\nnotes and gives me nutshells; but what is his sleight of hand to mine,\r\nwhen I fold up my own nutshells and pass them on myself as notes!\r\n\r\nHaving settled that I must go to the Blue Boar, my mind was much\r\ndisturbed by indecision whether or not to take the Avenger. It was\r\ntempting to think of that expensive Mercenary publicly airing his boots\r\nin the archway of the Blue Boar\xe2\x80\x99s posting-yard; it was almost solemn to\r\nimagine him casually produced in the tailor\xe2\x80\x99s shop, and confounding\r\nthe disrespectful senses of Trabb\xe2\x80\x99s boy. On the other hand, Trabb\xe2\x80\x99s boy\r\nmight worm himself into his intimacy and tell him things; or, reckless\r\nand desperate wretch as I knew he could be, might hoot him in the High\r\nStreet. My patroness, too, might hear of him, and not approve. On the\r\nwhole, I resolved to leave the Avenger behind.\r\n\r\nIt was the afternoon coach by which I had taken my place, and, as winter\r\nhad now come round, I should not arrive at my destination until two or\r\nthree hours after dark. Our time of starting from the Cross Keys was\r\ntwo o\xe2\x80\x99clock. I arrived on the ground with a quarter of an hour to spare,\r\nattended by the Avenger,--if I may connect that expression with one who\r\nnever attended on me if he could possibly help it.\r\n\r\nAt that time it was customary to carry Convicts down to the dock-yards\r\nby stage-coach. As I had often heard of them in the capacity of outside\r\npassengers, and had more than once seen them on the high road dangling\r\ntheir ironed legs over the coach roof, I had no cause to be surprised\r\nwhen Herbert, meeting me in the yard, came up and told me there were two\r\nconvicts going down with me. But I had a reason that was an old reason\r\nnow for constitutionally faltering whenever I heard the word \xe2\x80\x9cconvict.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t mind them, Handel?\xe2\x80\x9d said Herbert.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO no!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought you seemed as if you didn\xe2\x80\x99t like them?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t pretend that I do like them, and I suppose you don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nparticularly. But I don\xe2\x80\x99t mind them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSee! There they are,\xe2\x80\x9d said Herbert, \xe2\x80\x9ccoming out of the Tap. What a\r\ndegraded and vile sight it is!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey had been treating their guard, I suppose, for they had a gaoler\r\nwith them, and all three came out wiping their mouths on their hands.\r\nThe two convicts were handcuffed together, and had irons on their\r\nlegs,--irons of a pattern that I knew well. They wore the dress that I\r\nlikewise knew well. Their keeper had a brace of pistols, and carried\r\na thick-knobbed bludgeon under his arm; but he was on terms of good\r\nunderstanding with them, and stood with them beside him, looking on at\r\nthe putting-to of the horses, rather with an air as if the convicts were\r\nan interesting Exhibition not formally open at the moment, and he the\r\nCurator. One was a taller and stouter man than the other, and appeared\r\nas a matter of course, according to the mysterious ways of the world,\r\nboth convict and free, to have had allotted to him the smaller suit of\r\nclothes. His arms and legs were like great pincushions of those shapes,\r\nand his attire disguised him absurdly; but I knew his half-closed eye\r\nat one glance. There stood the man whom I had seen on the settle at the\r\nThree Jolly Bargemen on a Saturday night, and who had brought me down\r\nwith his invisible gun!\r\n\r\nIt was easy to make sure that as yet he knew me no more than if he had\r\nnever seen me in his life. He looked across at me, and his eye appraised\r\nmy watch-chain, and then he incidentally spat and said something to the\r\nother convict, and they laughed and slued themselves round with a clink\r\nof their coupling manacle, and looked at something else. The great\r\nnumbers on their backs, as if they were street doors; their coarse mangy\r\nungainly outer surface, as if they were lower animals; their ironed\r\nlegs, apologetically garlanded with pocket-handkerchiefs; and the way\r\nin which all present looked at them and kept from them; made them (as\r\nHerbert had said) a most disagreeable and degraded spectacle.\r\n\r\nBut this was not the worst of it. It came out that the whole of the back\r\nof the coach had been taken by a family removing from London, and that\r\nthere were no places for the two prisoners but on the seat in front\r\nbehind the coachman. Hereupon, a choleric gentleman, who had taken the\r\nfourth place on that seat, flew into a most violent passion, and said\r\nthat it was a breach of contract to mix him up with such villainous\r\ncompany, and that it was poisonous, and pernicious, and infamous, and\r\nshameful, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what else. At this time the coach was ready\r\nand the coachman impatient, and we were all preparing to get up, and\r\nthe prisoners had come over with their keeper,--bringing with them that\r\ncurious flavor of bread-poultice, baize, rope-yarn, and hearthstone,\r\nwhich attends the convict presence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t take it so much amiss, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d pleaded the keeper to the angry\r\npassenger; \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll sit next you myself. I\xe2\x80\x99ll put \xe2\x80\x98em on the outside of\r\nthe row. They won\xe2\x80\x99t interfere with you, sir. You needn\xe2\x80\x99t know they\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nthere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd don\xe2\x80\x99t blame me,\xe2\x80\x9d growled the convict I had recognized. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nwant to go. I am quite ready to stay behind. As fur as I am concerned\r\nany one\xe2\x80\x99s welcome to my place.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOr mine,\xe2\x80\x9d said the other, gruffly. \xe2\x80\x9cI wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have incommoded none\r\nof you, if I\xe2\x80\x99d had my way.\xe2\x80\x9d Then they both laughed, and began cracking\r\nnuts, and spitting the shells about.--As I really think I should have\r\nliked to do myself, if I had been in their place and so despised.\r\n\r\nAt length, it was voted that there was no help for the angry gentleman,\r\nand that he must either go in his chance company or remain behind. So he\r\ngot into his place, still making complaints, and the keeper got into the\r\nplace next him, and the convicts hauled themselves up as well as they\r\ncould, and the convict I had recognized sat behind me with his breath on\r\nthe hair of my head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-bye, Handel!\xe2\x80\x9d Herbert called out as we started. I thought what a\r\nblessed fortune it was, that he had found another name for me than Pip.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to express with what acuteness I felt the convict\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbreathing, not only on the back of my head, but all along my spine. The\r\nsensation was like being touched in the marrow with some pungent and\r\nsearching acid, it set my very teeth on edge. He seemed to have more\r\nbreathing business to do than another man, and to make more noise in\r\ndoing it; and I was conscious of growing high-shouldered on one side, in\r\nmy shrinking endeavors to fend him off.\r\n\r\nThe weather was miserably raw, and the two cursed the cold. It made us\r\nall lethargic before we had gone far, and when we had left the Half-way\r\nHouse behind, we habitually dozed and shivered and were silent. I dozed\r\noff, myself, in considering the question whether I ought to restore a\r\ncouple of pounds sterling to this creature before losing sight of him,\r\nand how it could best be done. In the act of dipping forward as if I\r\nwere going to bathe among the horses, I woke in a fright and took the\r\nquestion up again.\r\n\r\nBut I must have lost it longer than I had thought, since, although\r\nI could recognize nothing in the darkness and the fitful lights and\r\nshadows of our lamps, I traced marsh country in the cold damp wind that\r\nblew at us. Cowering forward for warmth and to make me a screen against\r\nthe wind, the convicts were closer to me than before. The very first\r\nwords I heard them interchange as I became conscious, were the words of\r\nmy own thought, \xe2\x80\x9cTwo One Pound notes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow did he get \xe2\x80\x98em?\xe2\x80\x9d said the convict I had never seen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow should I know?\xe2\x80\x9d returned the other. \xe2\x80\x9cHe had \xe2\x80\x98em stowed away\r\nsomehows. Giv him by friends, I expect.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish,\xe2\x80\x9d said the other, with a bitter curse upon the cold, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I had\r\n\xe2\x80\x98em here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwo one pound notes, or friends?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwo one pound notes. I\xe2\x80\x99d sell all the friends I ever had for one, and\r\nthink it a blessed good bargain. Well? So he says--?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo he says,\xe2\x80\x9d resumed the convict I had recognized,--\xe2\x80\x9cit was all\r\nsaid and done in half a minute, behind a pile of timber in the\r\nDock-yard,--\xe2\x80\x98You\xe2\x80\x99re a going to be discharged?\xe2\x80\x99 Yes, I was. Would I find\r\nout that boy that had fed him and kep his secret, and give him them two\r\none pound notes? Yes, I would. And I did.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMore fool you,\xe2\x80\x9d growled the other. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d have spent \xe2\x80\x98em on a Man, in\r\nwittles and drink. He must have been a green one. Mean to say he knowed\r\nnothing of you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot a ha\xe2\x80\x99porth. Different gangs and different ships. He was tried again\r\nfor prison breaking, and got made a Lifer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd was that--Honor!--the only time you worked out, in this part of the\r\ncountry?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe only time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat might have been your opinion of the place?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA most beastly place. Mudbank, mist, swamp, and work; work, swamp,\r\nmist, and mudbank.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey both execrated the place in very strong language, and gradually\r\ngrowled themselves out, and had nothing left to say.\r\n\r\nAfter overhearing this dialogue, I should assuredly have got down and\r\nbeen left in the solitude and darkness of the highway, but for feeling\r\ncertain that the man had no suspicion of my identity. Indeed, I was not\r\nonly so changed in the course of nature, but so differently dressed and\r\nso differently circumstanced, that it was not at all likely he could\r\nhave known me without accidental help. Still, the coincidence of our\r\nbeing together on the coach, was sufficiently strange to fill me with a\r\ndread that some other coincidence might at any moment connect me, in his\r\nhearing, with my name. For this reason, I resolved to alight as soon as\r\nwe touched the town, and put myself out of his hearing. This device I\r\nexecuted successfully. My little portmanteau was in the boot under my\r\nfeet; I had but to turn a hinge to get it out; I threw it down before\r\nme, got down after it, and was left at the first lamp on the first\r\nstones of the town pavement. As to the convicts, they went their way\r\nwith the coach, and I knew at what point they would be spirited off to\r\nthe river. In my fancy, I saw the boat with its convict crew waiting for\r\nthem at the slime-washed stairs,--again heard the gruff \xe2\x80\x9cGive way, you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n like and order to dogs,--again saw the wicked Noah\xe2\x80\x99s Ark lying out on\r\nthe black water.\r\n\r\nI could not have said what I was afraid of, for my fear was altogether\r\nundefined and vague, but there was great fear upon me. As I walked on to\r\nthe hotel, I felt that a dread, much exceeding the mere apprehension of\r\na painful or disagreeable recognition, made me tremble. I am confident\r\nthat it took no distinctness of shape, and that it was the revival for a\r\nfew minutes of the terror of childhood.\r\n\r\nThe coffee-room at the Blue Boar was empty, and I had not only ordered\r\nmy dinner there, but had sat down to it, before the waiter knew me. As\r\nsoon as he had apologized for the remissness of his memory, he asked me\r\nif he should send Boots for Mr. Pumblechook?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9ccertainly not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe waiter (it was he who had brought up the Great Remonstrance from the\r\nCommercials, on the day when I was bound) appeared surprised, and\r\ntook the earliest opportunity of putting a dirty old copy of a local\r\nnewspaper so directly in my way, that I took it up and read this\r\nparagraph:--\r\n\r\nOur readers will learn, not altogether without interest, in reference to\r\nthe recent romantic rise in fortune of a young artificer in iron of this\r\nneighborhood (what a theme, by the way, for the magic pen of our as yet\r\nnot universally acknowledged townsman TOOBY, the poet of our columns!)\r\nthat the youth\xe2\x80\x99s earliest patron, companion, and friend, was a highly\r\nrespected individual not entirely unconnected with the corn and seed\r\ntrade, and whose eminently convenient and commodious business premises\r\nare situate within a hundred miles of the High Street. It is not wholly\r\nirrespective of our personal feelings that we record HIM as the Mentor\r\nof our young Telemachus, for it is good to know that our town produced\r\nthe founder of the latter\xe2\x80\x99s fortunes. Does the thought-contracted brow\r\nof the local Sage or the lustrous eye of local Beauty inquire whose\r\nfortunes? We believe that Quintin Matsys was the BLACKSMITH of Antwerp.\r\nVERB. SAP.\r\n\r\nI entertain a conviction, based upon large experience, that if in the\r\ndays of my prosperity I had gone to the North Pole, I should have met\r\nsomebody there, wandering Esquimaux or civilized man, who would have\r\ntold me that Pumblechook was my earliest patron and the founder of my\r\nfortunes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXIX\r\n\r\nBetimes in the morning I was up and out. It was too early yet to go to\r\nMiss Havisham\xe2\x80\x99s, so I loitered into the country on Miss Havisham\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nside of town,--which was not Joe\xe2\x80\x99s side; I could go there\r\nto-morrow,--thinking about my patroness, and painting brilliant pictures\r\nof her plans for me.\r\n\r\nShe had adopted Estella, she had as good as adopted me, and it could not\r\nfail to be her intention to bring us together. She reserved it for me to\r\nrestore the desolate house, admit the sunshine into the dark rooms,\r\nset the clocks a-going and the cold hearths a-blazing, tear down the\r\ncobwebs, destroy the vermin,--in short, do all the shining deeds of the\r\nyoung Knight of romance, and marry the Princess. I had stopped to\r\nlook at the house as I passed; and its seared red brick walls, blocked\r\nwindows, and strong green ivy clasping even the stacks of chimneys with\r\nits twigs and tendons, as if with sinewy old arms, had made up a rich\r\nattractive mystery, of which I was the hero. Estella was the inspiration\r\nof it, and the heart of it, of course. But, though she had taken such\r\nstrong possession of me, though my fancy and my hope were so set upon\r\nher, though her influence on my boyish life and character had been\r\nall-powerful, I did not, even that romantic morning, invest her with any\r\nattributes save those she possessed. I mention this in this place, of a\r\nfixed purpose, because it is the clew by which I am to be followed into\r\nmy poor labyrinth. According to my experience, the conventional notion\r\nof a lover cannot be always true. The unqualified truth is, that when I\r\nloved Estella with the love of a man, I loved her simply because I found\r\nher irresistible. Once for all; I knew to my sorrow, often and often,\r\nif not always, that I loved her against reason, against promise, against\r\npeace, against hope, against happiness, against all discouragement that\r\ncould be. Once for all; I loved her none the less because I knew it,\r\nand it had no more influence in restraining me than if I had devoutly\r\nbelieved her to be human perfection.\r\n\r\nI so shaped out my walk as to arrive at the gate at my old time. When\r\nI had rung at the bell with an unsteady hand, I turned my back upon the\r\ngate, while I tried to get my breath and keep the beating of my heart\r\nmoderately quiet. I heard the side-door open, and steps come across the\r\ncourtyard; but I pretended not to hear, even when the gate swung on its\r\nrusty hinges.\r\n\r\nBeing at last touched on the shoulder, I started and turned. I started\r\nmuch more naturally then, to find myself confronted by a man in a sober\r\ngray dress. The last man I should have expected to see in that place of\r\nporter at Miss Havisham\xe2\x80\x99s door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOrlick!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh, young master, there\xe2\x80\x99s more changes than yours. But come in, come\r\nin. It\xe2\x80\x99s opposed to my orders to hold the gate open.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI entered and he swung it, and locked it, and took the key out. \xe2\x80\x9cYes!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n said he, facing round, after doggedly preceding me a few steps towards\r\nthe house. \xe2\x80\x9cHere I am!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow did you come here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI come her,\xe2\x80\x9d he retorted, \xe2\x80\x9con my legs. I had my box brought alongside\r\nme in a barrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you here for good?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI ain\xe2\x80\x99t here for harm, young master, I suppose?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI was not so sure of that. I had leisure to entertain the retort in my\r\nmind, while he slowly lifted his heavy glance from the pavement, up my\r\nlegs and arms, to my face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you have left the forge?\xe2\x80\x9d I said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo this look like a forge?\xe2\x80\x9d replied Orlick, sending his glance all\r\nround him with an air of injury. \xe2\x80\x9cNow, do it look like it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI asked him how long he had left Gargery\xe2\x80\x99s forge?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne day is so like another here,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I don\xe2\x80\x99t know\r\nwithout casting it up. However, I come here some time since you left.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI could have told you that, Orlick.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d said he, dryly. \xe2\x80\x9cBut then you\xe2\x80\x99ve got to be a scholar.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBy this time we had come to the house, where I found his room to be one\r\njust within the side-door, with a little window in it looking on the\r\ncourtyard. In its small proportions, it was not unlike the kind of place\r\nusually assigned to a gate-porter in Paris. Certain keys were hanging on\r\nthe wall, to which he now added the gate key; and his patchwork-covered\r\nbed was in a little inner division or recess. The whole had a slovenly,\r\nconfined, and sleepy look, like a cage for a human dormouse; while he,\r\nlooming dark and heavy in the shadow of a corner by the window, looked\r\nlike the human dormouse for whom it was fitted up,--as indeed he was.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI never saw this room before,\xe2\x80\x9d I remarked; \xe2\x80\x9cbut there used to be no\r\nPorter here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said he; \xe2\x80\x9cnot till it got about that there was no protection on\r\nthe premises, and it come to be considered dangerous, with convicts and\r\nTag and Rag and Bobtail going up and down. And then I was recommended to\r\nthe place as a man who could give another man as good as he brought, and\r\nI took it. It\xe2\x80\x99s easier than bellowsing and hammering.--That\xe2\x80\x99s loaded,\r\nthat is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMy eye had been caught by a gun with a brass-bound stock over the\r\nchimney-piece, and his eye had followed mine.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, not desirous of more conversation, \xe2\x80\x9cshall I go up to\r\nMiss Havisham?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBurn me, if I know!\xe2\x80\x9d he retorted, first stretching himself and then\r\nshaking himself; \xe2\x80\x9cmy orders ends here, young master. I give this here\r\nbell a rap with this here hammer, and you go on along the passage till\r\nyou meet somebody.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am expected, I believe?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBurn me twice over, if I can say!\xe2\x80\x9d said he.\r\n\r\nUpon that, I turned down the long passage which I had first trodden in\r\nmy thick boots, and he made his bell sound. At the end of the passage,\r\nwhile the bell was still reverberating, I found Sarah Pocket, who\r\nappeared to have now become constitutionally green and yellow by reason\r\nof me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d said she. \xe2\x80\x9cYou, is it, Mr. Pip?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is, Miss Pocket. I am glad to tell you that Mr. Pocket and family\r\nare all well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre they any wiser?\xe2\x80\x9d said Sarah, with a dismal shake of the head; \xe2\x80\x9cthey\r\nhad better be wiser, than well. Ah, Matthew, Matthew! You know your way,\r\nsir?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTolerably, for I had gone up the staircase in the dark, many a time. I\r\nascended it now, in lighter boots than of yore, and tapped in my old\r\nway at the door of Miss Havisham\xe2\x80\x99s room. \xe2\x80\x9cPip\xe2\x80\x99s rap,\xe2\x80\x9d I heard her say,\r\nimmediately; \xe2\x80\x9ccome in, Pip.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was in her chair near the old table, in the old dress, with her two\r\nhands crossed on her stick, her chin resting on them, and her eyes on\r\nthe fire. Sitting near her, with the white shoe, that had never been\r\nworn, in her hand, and her head bent as she looked at it, was an elegant\r\nlady whom I had never seen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome in, Pip,\xe2\x80\x9d Miss Havisham continued to mutter, without looking round\r\nor up; \xe2\x80\x9ccome in, Pip, how do you do, Pip? so you kiss my hand as if I\r\nwere a queen, eh?--Well?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe looked up at me suddenly, only moving her eyes, and repeated in a\r\ngrimly playful manner,--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI heard, Miss Havisham,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, rather at a loss, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you were so\r\nkind as to wish me to come and see you, and I came directly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe lady whom I had never seen before, lifted up her eyes and looked\r\narchly at me, and then I saw that the eyes were Estella\xe2\x80\x99s eyes. But she\r\nwas so much changed, was so much more beautiful, so much more womanly,\r\nin all things winning admiration, had made such wonderful advance,\r\nthat I seemed to have made none. I fancied, as I looked at her, that\r\nI slipped hopelessly back into the coarse and common boy again. O\r\nthe sense of distance and disparity that came upon me, and the\r\ninaccessibility that came about her!\r\n\r\nShe gave me her hand. I stammered something about the pleasure I felt in\r\nseeing her again, and about my having looked forward to it, for a long,\r\nlong time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you find her much changed, Pip?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Miss Havisham, with her\r\ngreedy look, and striking her stick upon a chair that stood between\r\nthem, as a sign to me to sit down there.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen I came in, Miss Havisham, I thought there was nothing of Estella\r\nin the face or figure; but now it all settles down so curiously into the\r\nold--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat? You are not going to say into the old Estella?\xe2\x80\x9d Miss Havisham\r\ninterrupted. \xe2\x80\x9cShe was proud and insulting, and you wanted to go away\r\nfrom her. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you remember?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI said confusedly that that was long ago, and that I knew no better\r\nthen, and the like. Estella smiled with perfect composure, and said she\r\nhad no doubt of my having been quite right, and of her having been very\r\ndisagreeable.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs he changed?\xe2\x80\x9d Miss Havisham asked her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery much,\xe2\x80\x9d said Estella, looking at me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLess coarse and common?\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Havisham, playing with Estella\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhair.\r\n\r\nEstella laughed, and looked at the shoe in her hand, and laughed again,\r\nand looked at me, and put the shoe down. She treated me as a boy still,\r\nbut she lured me on.\r\n\r\nWe sat in the dreamy room among the old strange influences which had\r\nso wrought upon me, and I learnt that she had but just come home from\r\nFrance, and that she was going to London. Proud and wilful as of old,\r\nshe had brought those qualities into such subjection to her beauty that\r\nit was impossible and out of nature--or I thought so--to separate them\r\nfrom her beauty. Truly it was impossible to dissociate her presence\r\nfrom all those wretched hankerings after money and gentility that had\r\ndisturbed my boyhood,--from all those ill-regulated aspirations that had\r\nfirst made me ashamed of home and Joe,--from all those visions that had\r\nraised her face in the glowing fire, struck it out of the iron on the\r\nanvil, extracted it from the darkness of night to look in at the wooden\r\nwindow of the forge, and flit away. In a word, it was impossible for me\r\nto separate her, in the past or in the present, from the innermost life\r\nof my life.\r\n\r\nIt was settled that I should stay there all the rest of the day, and\r\nreturn to the hotel at night, and to London to-morrow. When we had\r\nconversed for a while, Miss Havisham sent us two out to walk in the\r\nneglected garden: on our coming in by and by, she said, I should wheel\r\nher about a little, as in times of yore.\r\n\r\nSo, Estella and I went out into the garden by the gate through which I\r\nhad strayed to my encounter with the pale young gentleman, now Herbert;\r\nI, trembling in spirit and worshipping the very hem of her dress; she,\r\nquite composed and most decidedly not worshipping the hem of mine. As we\r\ndrew near to the place of encounter, she stopped and said,--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must have been a singular little creature to hide and see that fight\r\nthat day; but I did, and I enjoyed it very much.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou rewarded me very much.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid I?\xe2\x80\x9d she replied, in an incidental and forgetful way. \xe2\x80\x9cI remember I\r\nentertained a great objection to your adversary, because I took it ill\r\nthat he should be brought here to pester me with his company.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe and I are great friends now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you? I think I recollect though, that you read with his father?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI made the admission with reluctance, for it seemed to have a boyish\r\nlook, and she already treated me more than enough like a boy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSince your change of fortune and prospects, you have changed your\r\ncompanions,\xe2\x80\x9d said Estella.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNaturally,\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd necessarily,\xe2\x80\x9d she added, in a haughty tone; \xe2\x80\x9cwhat was fit company\r\nfor you once, would be quite unfit company for you now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn my conscience, I doubt very much whether I had any lingering\r\nintention left of going to see Joe; but if I had, this observation put\r\nit to flight.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou had no idea of your impending good fortune, in those times?\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nEstella, with a slight wave of her hand, signifying in the fighting\r\ntimes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot the least.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe air of completeness and superiority with which she walked at my\r\nside, and the air of youthfulness and submission with which I walked at\r\nhers, made a contrast that I strongly felt. It would have rankled in me\r\nmore than it did, if I had not regarded myself as eliciting it by being\r\nso set apart for her and assigned to her.\r\n\r\nThe garden was too overgrown and rank for walking in with ease, and\r\nafter we had made the round of it twice or thrice, we came out again\r\ninto the brewery yard. I showed her to a nicety where I had seen her\r\nwalking on the casks, that first old day, and she said, with a cold and\r\ncareless look in that direction, \xe2\x80\x9cDid I?\xe2\x80\x9d I reminded her where she had\r\ncome out of the house and given me my meat and drink, and she said, \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t remember.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cNot remember that you made me cry?\xe2\x80\x9d said I. \xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nshe, and shook her head and looked about her. I verily believe that\r\nher not remembering and not minding in the least, made me cry again,\r\ninwardly,--and that is the sharpest crying of all.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou must know,\xe2\x80\x9d said Estella, condescending to me as a brilliant and\r\nbeautiful woman might, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I have no heart,--if that has anything to\r\ndo with my memory.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI got through some jargon to the effect that I took the liberty of\r\ndoubting that. That I knew better. That there could be no such beauty\r\nwithout it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! I have a heart to be stabbed in or shot in, I have no doubt,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nEstella, \xe2\x80\x9cand of course if it ceased to beat I should cease\r\nto be. But you know what I mean. I have no softness there,\r\nno--sympathy--sentiment--nonsense.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhat was it that was borne in upon my mind when she stood still and\r\nlooked attentively at me? Anything that I had seen in Miss Havisham? No.\r\nIn some of her looks and gestures there was that tinge of resemblance\r\nto Miss Havisham which may often be noticed to have been acquired by\r\nchildren, from grown person with whom they have been much associated and\r\nsecluded, and which, when childhood is passed, will produce a remarkable\r\noccasional likeness of expression between faces that are otherwise quite\r\ndifferent. And yet I could not trace this to Miss Havisham. I looked\r\nagain, and though she was still looking at me, the suggestion was gone.\r\n\r\nWhat was it?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am serious,\xe2\x80\x9d said Estella, not so much with a frown (for her brow was\r\nsmooth) as with a darkening of her face; \xe2\x80\x9cif we are to be thrown much\r\ntogether, you had better believe it at once. No!\xe2\x80\x9d imperiously stopping\r\nme as I opened my lips. \xe2\x80\x9cI have not bestowed my tenderness anywhere. I\r\nhave never had any such thing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn another moment we were in the brewery, so long disused, and she\r\npointed to the high gallery where I had seen her going out on that same\r\nfirst day, and told me she remembered to have been up there, and to have\r\nseen me standing scared below. As my eyes followed her white hand, again\r\nthe same dim suggestion that I could not possibly grasp crossed me. My\r\ninvoluntary start occasioned her to lay her hand upon my arm. Instantly\r\nthe ghost passed once more and was gone.\r\n\r\nWhat was it?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is the matter?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Estella. \xe2\x80\x9cAre you scared again?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should be, if I believed what you said just now,\xe2\x80\x9d I replied, to turn\r\nit off.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you don\xe2\x80\x99t? Very well. It is said, at any rate. Miss Havisham will\r\nsoon be expecting you at your old post, though I think that might be\r\nlaid aside now, with other old belongings. Let us make one more round\r\nof the garden, and then go in. Come! You shall not shed tears for my\r\ncruelty to-day; you shall be my Page, and give me your shoulder.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer handsome dress had trailed upon the ground. She held it in one hand\r\nnow, and with the other lightly touched my shoulder as we walked. We\r\nwalked round the ruined garden twice or thrice more, and it was all in\r\nbloom for me. If the green and yellow growth of weed in the chinks of\r\nthe old wall had been the most precious flowers that ever blew, it could\r\nnot have been more cherished in my remembrance.\r\n\r\nThere was no discrepancy of years between us to remove her far from me;\r\nwe were of nearly the same age, though of course the age told for more\r\nin her case than in mine; but the air of inaccessibility which her\r\nbeauty and her manner gave her, tormented me in the midst of my delight,\r\nand at the height of the assurance I felt that our patroness had chosen\r\nus for one another. Wretched boy!\r\n\r\nAt last we went back into the house, and there I heard, with surprise,\r\nthat my guardian had come down to see Miss Havisham on business, and\r\nwould come back to dinner. The old wintry branches of chandeliers in\r\nthe room where the mouldering table was spread had been lighted while we\r\nwere out, and Miss Havisham was in her chair and waiting for me.\r\n\r\nIt was like pushing the chair itself back into the past, when we began\r\nthe old slow circuit round about the ashes of the bridal feast. But,\r\nin the funereal room, with that figure of the grave fallen back in the\r\nchair fixing its eyes upon her, Estella looked more bright and beautiful\r\nthan before, and I was under stronger enchantment.\r\n\r\nThe time so melted away, that our early dinner-hour drew close at hand,\r\nand Estella left us to prepare herself. We had stopped near the centre\r\nof the long table, and Miss Havisham, with one of her withered arms\r\nstretched out of the chair, rested that clenched hand upon the yellow\r\ncloth. As Estella looked back over her shoulder before going out at the\r\ndoor, Miss Havisham kissed that hand to her, with a ravenous intensity\r\nthat was of its kind quite dreadful.\r\n\r\nThen, Estella being gone and we two left alone, she turned to me, and\r\nsaid in a whisper,--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs she beautiful, graceful, well-grown? Do you admire her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEverybody must who sees her, Miss Havisham.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe drew an arm round my neck, and drew my head close down to hers as\r\nshe sat in the chair. \xe2\x80\x9cLove her, love her, love her! How does she use\r\nyou?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBefore I could answer (if I could have answered so difficult a question\r\nat all) she repeated, \xe2\x80\x9cLove her, love her, love her! If she favors\r\nyou, love her. If she wounds you, love her. If she tears your heart to\r\npieces,--and as it gets older and stronger it will tear deeper,--love\r\nher, love her, love her!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNever had I seen such passionate eagerness as was joined to her\r\nutterance of these words. I could feel the muscles of the thin arm round\r\nmy neck swell with the vehemence that possessed her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHear me, Pip! I adopted her, to be loved. I bred her and educated her,\r\nto be loved. I developed her into what she is, that she might be loved.\r\nLove her!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe said the word often enough, and there could be no doubt that she\r\nmeant to say it; but if the often repeated word had been hate instead of\r\nlove--despair--revenge--dire death--it could not have sounded from her\r\nlips more like a curse.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, in the same hurried passionate whisper, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat\r\nreal love is. It is blind devotion, unquestioning self-humiliation,\r\nutter submission, trust and belief against yourself and against the\r\nwhole world, giving up your whole heart and soul to the smiter--as I\r\ndid!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen she came to that, and to a wild cry that followed that, I caught\r\nher round the waist. For she rose up in the chair, in her shroud of a\r\ndress, and struck at the air as if she would as soon have struck herself\r\nagainst the wall and fallen dead.\r\n\r\nAll this passed in a few seconds. As I drew her down into her chair, I\r\nwas conscious of a scent that I knew, and turning, saw my guardian in\r\nthe room.\r\n\r\nHe always carried (I have not yet mentioned it, I think) a\r\npocket-handkerchief of rich silk and of imposing proportions, which was\r\nof great value to him in his profession. I have seen him so terrify a\r\nclient or a witness by ceremoniously unfolding this pocket-handkerchief\r\nas if he were immediately going to blow his nose, and then pausing,\r\nas if he knew he should not have time to do it before such client\r\nor witness committed himself, that the self-committal has followed\r\ndirectly, quite as a matter of course. When I saw him in the room he had\r\nthis expressive pocket-handkerchief in both hands, and was looking at\r\nus. On meeting my eye, he said plainly, by a momentary and silent pause\r\nin that attitude, \xe2\x80\x9cIndeed? Singular!\xe2\x80\x9d and then put the handkerchief to\r\nits right use with wonderful effect.\r\n\r\nMiss Havisham had seen him as soon as I, and was (like everybody\r\nelse) afraid of him. She made a strong attempt to compose herself, and\r\nstammered that he was as punctual as ever.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs punctual as ever,\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated, coming up to us. \xe2\x80\x9c(How do you do,\r\nPip? Shall I give you a ride, Miss Havisham? Once round?) And so you are\r\nhere, Pip?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI told him when I had arrived, and how Miss Havisham had wished me to\r\ncome and see Estella. To which he replied, \xe2\x80\x9cAh! Very fine young lady!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n Then he pushed Miss Havisham in her chair before him, with one of his\r\nlarge hands, and put the other in his trousers-pocket as if the pocket\r\nwere full of secrets.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Pip! How often have you seen Miss Estella before?\xe2\x80\x9d said he, when\r\nhe came to a stop.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow often?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! How many times? Ten thousand times?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! Certainly not so many.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwice?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJaggers,\xe2\x80\x9d interposed Miss Havisham, much to my relief, \xe2\x80\x9cleave my Pip\r\nalone, and go with him to your dinner.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe complied, and we groped our way down the dark stairs together. While\r\nwe were still on our way to those detached apartments across the paved\r\nyard at the back, he asked me how often I had seen Miss Havisham eat\r\nand drink; offering me a breadth of choice, as usual, between a hundred\r\ntimes and once.\r\n\r\nI considered, and said, \xe2\x80\x9cNever.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd never will, Pip,\xe2\x80\x9d he retorted, with a frowning smile. \xe2\x80\x9cShe has\r\nnever allowed herself to be seen doing either, since she lived this\r\npresent life of hers. She wanders about in the night, and then lays\r\nhands on such food as she takes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPray, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cmay I ask you a question?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou may,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cand I may decline to answer it. Put your question.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEstella\xe2\x80\x99s name. Is it Havisham or--?\xe2\x80\x9d I had nothing to add.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOr what?\xe2\x80\x9d said he.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it Havisham?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is Havisham.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis brought us to the dinner-table, where she and Sarah Pocket awaited\r\nus. Mr. Jaggers presided, Estella sat opposite to him, I faced my\r\ngreen and yellow friend. We dined very well, and were waited on by a\r\nmaid-servant whom I had never seen in all my comings and goings, but\r\nwho, for anything I know, had been in that mysterious house the whole\r\ntime. After dinner a bottle of choice old port was placed before my\r\nguardian (he was evidently well acquainted with the vintage), and the\r\ntwo ladies left us.\r\n\r\nAnything to equal the determined reticence of Mr. Jaggers under that\r\nroof I never saw elsewhere, even in him. He kept his very looks to\r\nhimself, and scarcely directed his eyes to Estella\xe2\x80\x99s face once during\r\ndinner. When she spoke to him, he listened, and in due course answered,\r\nbut never looked at her, that I could see. On the other hand, she often\r\nlooked at him, with interest and curiosity, if not distrust, but his\r\nface never showed the least consciousness. Throughout dinner he took\r\na dry delight in making Sarah Pocket greener and yellower, by often\r\nreferring in conversation with me to my expectations; but here,\r\nagain, he showed no consciousness, and even made it appear that he\r\nextorted--and even did extort, though I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how--those references\r\nout of my innocent self.\r\n\r\nAnd when he and I were left alone together, he sat with an air upon him\r\nof general lying by in consequence of information he possessed, that\r\nreally was too much for me. He cross-examined his very wine when he had\r\nnothing else in hand. He held it between himself and the candle, tasted\r\nthe port, rolled it in his mouth, swallowed it, looked at his\r\nglass again, smelt the port, tried it, drank it, filled again, and\r\ncross-examined the glass again, until I was as nervous as if I had known\r\nthe wine to be telling him something to my disadvantage. Three or four\r\ntimes I feebly thought I would start conversation; but whenever he saw\r\nme going to ask him anything, he looked at me with his glass in his\r\nhand, and rolling his wine about in his mouth, as if requesting me to\r\ntake notice that it was of no use, for he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t answer.\r\n\r\nI think Miss Pocket was conscious that the sight of me involved her\r\nin the danger of being goaded to madness, and perhaps tearing off her\r\ncap,--which was a very hideous one, in the nature of a muslin mop,--and\r\nstrewing the ground with her hair,--which assuredly had never grown\r\non her head. She did not appear when we afterwards went up to Miss\r\nHavisham\xe2\x80\x99s room, and we four played at whist. In the interval, Miss\r\nHavisham, in a fantastic way, had put some of the most beautiful jewels\r\nfrom her dressing-table into Estella\xe2\x80\x99s hair, and about her bosom and\r\narms; and I saw even my guardian look at her from under his thick\r\neyebrows, and raise them a little, when her loveliness was before him,\r\nwith those rich flushes of glitter and color in it.\r\n\r\nOf the manner and extent to which he took our trumps into custody, and\r\ncame out with mean little cards at the ends of hands, before which the\r\nglory of our Kings and Queens was utterly abased, I say nothing; nor, of\r\nthe feeling that I had, respecting his looking upon us personally in the\r\nlight of three very obvious and poor riddles that he had found out long\r\nago. What I suffered from, was the incompatibility between his cold\r\npresence and my feelings towards Estella. It was not that I knew I could\r\nnever bear to speak to him about her, that I knew I could never bear to\r\nhear him creak his boots at her, that I knew I could never bear to see\r\nhim wash his hands of her; it was, that my admiration should be within\r\na foot or two of him,--it was, that my feelings should be in the same\r\nplace with him,--that, was the agonizing circumstance.\r\n\r\nWe played until nine o\xe2\x80\x99clock, and then it was arranged that when Estella\r\ncame to London I should be forewarned of her coming and should meet her\r\nat the coach; and then I took leave of her, and touched her and left\r\nher.\r\n\r\nMy guardian lay at the Boar in the next room to mine. Far into the\r\nnight, Miss Havisham\xe2\x80\x99s words, \xe2\x80\x9cLove her, love her, love her!\xe2\x80\x9d sounded in\r\nmy ears. I adapted them for my own repetition, and said to my pillow, \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nlove her, I love her, I love her!\xe2\x80\x9d hundreds of times. Then, a burst of\r\ngratitude came upon me, that she should be destined for me, once the\r\nblacksmith\xe2\x80\x99s boy. Then I thought if she were, as I feared, by no means\r\nrapturously grateful for that destiny yet, when would she begin to be\r\ninterested in me? When should I awaken the heart within her that was\r\nmute and sleeping now?\r\n\r\nAh me! I thought those were high and great emotions. But I never thought\r\nthere was anything low and small in my keeping away from Joe, because\r\nI knew she would be contemptuous of him. It was but a day gone, and Joe\r\nhad brought the tears into my eyes; they had soon dried, God forgive me!\r\nsoon dried.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXX\r\n\r\nAfter well considering the matter while I was dressing at the Blue Boar\r\nin the morning, I resolved to tell my guardian that I doubted Orlick\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbeing the right sort of man to fill a post of trust at Miss Havisham\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy of course he is not the right sort of man, Pip,\xe2\x80\x9d said my guardian,\r\ncomfortably satisfied beforehand on the general head, \xe2\x80\x9cbecause the man\r\nwho fills the post of trust never is the right sort of man.\xe2\x80\x9d It seemed\r\nquite to put him into spirits to find that this particular post was\r\nnot exceptionally held by the right sort of man, and he listened in a\r\nsatisfied manner while I told him what knowledge I had of Orlick. \xe2\x80\x9cVery\r\ngood, Pip,\xe2\x80\x9d he observed, when I had concluded, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll go round presently,\r\nand pay our friend off.\xe2\x80\x9d Rather alarmed by this summary action, I was\r\nfor a little delay, and even hinted that our friend himself might be\r\ndifficult to deal with. \xe2\x80\x9cOh no he won\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d said my guardian, making his\r\npocket-handkerchief-point, with perfect confidence; \xe2\x80\x9cI should like to\r\nsee him argue the question with me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs we were going back together to London by the midday coach, and as I\r\nbreakfasted under such terrors of Pumblechook that I could scarcely hold\r\nmy cup, this gave me an opportunity of saying that I wanted a walk, and\r\nthat I would go on along the London road while Mr. Jaggers was occupied,\r\nif he would let the coachman know that I would get into my place when\r\novertaken. I was thus enabled to fly from the Blue Boar immediately\r\nafter breakfast. By then making a loop of about a couple of miles into\r\nthe open country at the back of Pumblechook\xe2\x80\x99s premises, I got round into\r\nthe High Street again, a little beyond that pitfall, and felt myself in\r\ncomparative security.\r\n\r\nIt was interesting to be in the quiet old town once more, and it was not\r\ndisagreeable to be here and there suddenly recognized and stared after.\r\nOne or two of the tradespeople even darted out of their shops and went\r\na little way down the street before me, that they might turn, as if they\r\nhad forgotten something, and pass me face to face,--on which occasions I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t know whether they or I made the worse pretence; they of not doing\r\nit, or I of not seeing it. Still my position was a distinguished one,\r\nand I was not at all dissatisfied with it, until Fate threw me in the\r\nway of that unlimited miscreant, Trabb\xe2\x80\x99s boy.\r\n\r\nCasting my eyes along the street at a certain point of my progress, I\r\nbeheld Trabb\xe2\x80\x99s boy approaching, lashing himself with an empty blue bag.\r\nDeeming that a serene and unconscious contemplation of him would best\r\nbeseem me, and would be most likely to quell his evil mind, I advanced\r\nwith that expression of countenance, and was rather congratulating\r\nmyself on my success, when suddenly the knees of Trabb\xe2\x80\x99s boy smote\r\ntogether, his hair uprose, his cap fell off, he trembled violently in\r\nevery limb, staggered out into the road, and crying to the populace,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHold me! I\xe2\x80\x99m so frightened!\xe2\x80\x9d feigned to be in a paroxysm of terror and\r\ncontrition, occasioned by the dignity of my appearance. As I passed him,\r\nhis teeth loudly chattered in his head, and with every mark of extreme\r\nhumiliation, he prostrated himself in the dust.\r\n\r\nThis was a hard thing to bear, but this was nothing. I had not advanced\r\nanother two hundred yards when, to my inexpressible terror, amazement,\r\nand indignation, I again beheld Trabb\xe2\x80\x99s boy approaching. He was coming\r\nround a narrow corner. His blue bag was slung over his shoulder, honest\r\nindustry beamed in his eyes, a determination to proceed to Trabb\xe2\x80\x99s with\r\ncheerful briskness was indicated in his gait. With a shock he became\r\naware of me, and was severely visited as before; but this time his\r\nmotion was rotatory, and he staggered round and round me with knees\r\nmore afflicted, and with uplifted hands as if beseeching for mercy. His\r\nsufferings were hailed with the greatest joy by a knot of spectators,\r\nand I felt utterly confounded.\r\n\r\nI had not got as much further down the street as the post-office, when I\r\nagain beheld Trabb\xe2\x80\x99s boy shooting round by a back way. This time, he was\r\nentirely changed. He wore the blue bag in the manner of my great-coat,\r\nand was strutting along the pavement towards me on the opposite side of\r\nthe street, attended by a company of delighted young friends to whom he\r\nfrom time to time exclaimed, with a wave of his hand, \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t know yah!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n Words cannot state the amount of aggravation and injury wreaked upon\r\nme by Trabb\xe2\x80\x99s boy, when passing abreast of me, he pulled up his\r\nshirt-collar, twined his side-hair, stuck an arm akimbo, and smirked\r\nextravagantly by, wriggling his elbows and body, and drawling to his\r\nattendants, \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t know yah, don\xe2\x80\x99t know yah, \xe2\x80\x98pon my soul don\xe2\x80\x99t know\r\nyah!\xe2\x80\x9d The disgrace attendant on his immediately afterwards taking\r\nto crowing and pursuing me across the bridge with crows, as from an\r\nexceedingly dejected fowl who had known me when I was a blacksmith,\r\nculminated the disgrace with which I left the town, and was, so to\r\nspeak, ejected by it into the open country.\r\n\r\nBut unless I had taken the life of Trabb\xe2\x80\x99s boy on that occasion, I\r\nreally do not even now see what I could have done save endure. To\r\nhave struggled with him in the street, or to have exacted any lower\r\nrecompense from him than his heart\xe2\x80\x99s best blood, would have been\r\nfutile and degrading. Moreover, he was a boy whom no man could hurt; an\r\ninvulnerable and dodging serpent who, when chased into a corner, flew\r\nout again between his captor\xe2\x80\x99s legs, scornfully yelping. I wrote,\r\nhowever, to Mr. Trabb by next day\xe2\x80\x99s post, to say that Mr. Pip must\r\ndecline to deal further with one who could so far forget what he owed to\r\nthe best interests of society, as to employ a boy who excited Loathing\r\nin every respectable mind.\r\n\r\nThe coach, with Mr. Jaggers inside, came up in due time, and I took my\r\nbox-seat again, and arrived in London safe,--but not sound, for my heart\r\nwas gone. As soon as I arrived, I sent a penitential codfish and barrel\r\nof oysters to Joe (as reparation for not having gone myself), and then\r\nwent on to Barnard\xe2\x80\x99s Inn.\r\n\r\nI found Herbert dining on cold meat, and delighted to welcome me back.\r\nHaving despatched The Avenger to the coffee-house for an addition to the\r\ndinner, I felt that I must open my breast that very evening to my friend\r\nand chum. As confidence was out of the question with The Avenger in the\r\nhall, which could merely be regarded in the light of an antechamber to\r\nthe keyhole, I sent him to the Play. A better proof of the severity\r\nof my bondage to that taskmaster could scarcely be afforded, than\r\nthe degrading shifts to which I was constantly driven to find him\r\nemployment. So mean is extremity, that I sometimes sent him to Hyde Park\r\ncorner to see what o\xe2\x80\x99clock it was.\r\n\r\nDinner done and we sitting with our feet upon the fender, I said to\r\nHerbert, \xe2\x80\x9cMy dear Herbert, I have something very particular to tell\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear Handel,\xe2\x80\x9d he returned, \xe2\x80\x9cI shall esteem and respect your\r\nconfidence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt concerns myself, Herbert,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cand one other person.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHerbert crossed his feet, looked at the fire with his head on one side,\r\nand having looked at it in vain for some time, looked at me because I\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t go on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHerbert,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, laying my hand upon his knee, \xe2\x80\x9cI love--I\r\nadore--Estella.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nInstead of being transfixed, Herbert replied in an easy matter-of-course\r\nway, \xe2\x80\x9cExactly. Well?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Herbert? Is that all you say? Well?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat next, I mean?\xe2\x80\x9d said Herbert. \xe2\x80\x9cOf course I know that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do you know it?\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do I know it, Handel? Why, from you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI never told you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTold me! You have never told me when you have got your hair cut, but I\r\nhave had senses to perceive it. You have always adored her, ever since\r\nI have known you. You brought your adoration and your portmanteau here\r\ntogether. Told me! Why, you have always told me all day long. When you\r\ntold me your own story, you told me plainly that you began adoring her\r\nthe first time you saw her, when you were very young indeed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well, then,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, to whom this was a new and not unwelcome\r\nlight, \xe2\x80\x9cI have never left off adoring her. And she has come back, a most\r\nbeautiful and most elegant creature. And I saw her yesterday. And if I\r\nadored her before, I now doubly adore her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLucky for you then, Handel,\xe2\x80\x9d said Herbert, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you are picked out for\r\nher and allotted to her. Without encroaching on forbidden ground, we\r\nmay venture to say that there can be no doubt between ourselves of\r\nthat fact. Have you any idea yet, of Estella\xe2\x80\x99s views on the adoration\r\nquestion?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI shook my head gloomily. \xe2\x80\x9cOh! She is thousands of miles away, from me,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPatience, my dear Handel: time enough, time enough. But you have\r\nsomething more to say?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am ashamed to say it,\xe2\x80\x9d I returned, \xe2\x80\x9cand yet it\xe2\x80\x99s no worse to say it\r\nthan to think it. You call me a lucky fellow. Of course, I am. I was a\r\nblacksmith\xe2\x80\x99s boy but yesterday; I am--what shall I say I am--to-day?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSay a good fellow, if you want a phrase,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Herbert, smiling,\r\nand clapping his hand on the back of mine--\xe2\x80\x9ca good fellow, with\r\nimpetuosity and hesitation, boldness and diffidence, action and\r\ndreaming, curiously mixed in him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI stopped for a moment to consider whether there really was this mixture\r\nin my character. On the whole, I by no means recognized the analysis,\r\nbut thought it not worth disputing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen I ask what I am to call myself to-day, Herbert,\xe2\x80\x9d I went on, \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nsuggest what I have in my thoughts. You say I am lucky. I know I have\r\ndone nothing to raise myself in life, and that Fortune alone has raised\r\nme; that is being very lucky. And yet, when I think of Estella--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n(\xe2\x80\x9cAnd when don\xe2\x80\x99t you, you know?\xe2\x80\x9d Herbert threw in, with his eyes on the\r\nfire; which I thought kind and sympathetic of him.)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c--Then, my dear Herbert, I cannot tell you how dependent and uncertain\r\nI feel, and how exposed to hundreds of chances. Avoiding forbidden\r\nground, as you did just now, I may still say that on the constancy of\r\none person (naming no person) all my expectations depend. And at the\r\nbest, how indefinite and unsatisfactory, only to know so vaguely what\r\nthey are!\xe2\x80\x9d In saying this, I relieved my mind of what had always been\r\nthere, more or less, though no doubt most since yesterday.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, Handel,\xe2\x80\x9d Herbert replied, in his gay, hopeful way, \xe2\x80\x9cit seems to me\r\nthat in the despondency of the tender passion, we are looking into our\r\ngift-horse\xe2\x80\x99s mouth with a magnifying-glass. Likewise, it seems to me\r\nthat, concentrating our attention on the examination, we altogether\r\noverlook one of the best points of the animal. Didn\xe2\x80\x99t you tell me that\r\nyour guardian, Mr. Jaggers, told you in the beginning, that you were\r\nnot endowed with expectations only? And even if he had not told you\r\nso,--though that is a very large If, I grant,--could you believe that of\r\nall men in London, Mr. Jaggers is the man to hold his present relations\r\ntowards you unless he were sure of his ground?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI said I could not deny that this was a strong point. I said it (people\r\noften do so, in such cases) like a rather reluctant concession to truth\r\nand justice;--as if I wanted to deny it!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should think it was a strong point,\xe2\x80\x9d said Herbert, \xe2\x80\x9cand I should\r\nthink you would be puzzled to imagine a stronger; as to the rest, you\r\nmust bide your guardian\xe2\x80\x99s time, and he must bide his client\xe2\x80\x99s time.\r\nYou\xe2\x80\x99ll be one-and-twenty before you know where you are, and then perhaps\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ll get some further enlightenment. At all events, you\xe2\x80\x99ll be nearer\r\ngetting it, for it must come at last.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a hopeful disposition you have!\xe2\x80\x9d said I, gratefully admiring his\r\ncheery ways.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI ought to have,\xe2\x80\x9d said Herbert, \xe2\x80\x9cfor I have not much else. I must\r\nacknowledge, by the by, that the good sense of what I have just said is\r\nnot my own, but my father\xe2\x80\x99s. The only remark I ever heard him make on\r\nyour story, was the final one, \xe2\x80\x9cThe thing is settled and done, or Mr.\r\nJaggers would not be in it.\xe2\x80\x9d And now before I say anything more about my\r\nfather, or my father\xe2\x80\x99s son, and repay confidence with confidence, I want\r\nto make myself seriously disagreeable to you for a moment,--positively\r\nrepulsive.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou won\xe2\x80\x99t succeed,\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO yes I shall!\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cOne, two, three, and now I am in for it.\r\nHandel, my good fellow;\xe2\x80\x9d--though he spoke in this light tone, he was\r\nvery much in earnest,--\xe2\x80\x9cI have been thinking since we have been talking\r\nwith our feet on this fender, that Estella surely cannot be a condition\r\nof your inheritance, if she was never referred to by your guardian. Am\r\nI right in so understanding what you have told me, as that he never\r\nreferred to her, directly or indirectly, in any way? Never even hinted,\r\nfor instance, that your patron might have views as to your marriage\r\nultimately?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, Handel, I am quite free from the flavor of sour grapes, upon my\r\nsoul and honor! Not being bound to her, can you not detach yourself from\r\nher?--I told you I should be disagreeable.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI turned my head aside, for, with a rush and a sweep, like the old marsh\r\nwinds coming up from the sea, a feeling like that which had subdued\r\nme on the morning when I left the forge, when the mists were solemnly\r\nrising, and when I laid my hand upon the village finger-post, smote upon\r\nmy heart again. There was silence between us for a little while.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; but my dear Handel,\xe2\x80\x9d Herbert went on, as if we had been talking,\r\ninstead of silent, \xe2\x80\x9cits having been so strongly rooted in the breast of\r\na boy whom nature and circumstances made so romantic, renders it very\r\nserious. Think of her bringing-up, and think of Miss Havisham. Think of\r\nwhat she is herself (now I am repulsive and you abominate me). This may\r\nlead to miserable things.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know it, Herbert,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, with my head still turned away, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t help it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can\xe2\x80\x99t detach yourself?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. Impossible!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can\xe2\x80\x99t try, Handel?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. Impossible!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell!\xe2\x80\x9d said Herbert, getting up with a lively shake as if he had\r\nbeen asleep, and stirring the fire, \xe2\x80\x9cnow I\xe2\x80\x99ll endeavor to make myself\r\nagreeable again!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo he went round the room and shook the curtains out, put the chairs\r\nin their places, tidied the books and so forth that were lying about,\r\nlooked into the hall, peeped into the letter-box, shut the door, and\r\ncame back to his chair by the fire: where he sat down, nursing his left\r\nleg in both arms.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was going to say a word or two, Handel, concerning my father and my\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s son. I am afraid it is scarcely necessary for my father\xe2\x80\x99s son\r\nto remark that my father\xe2\x80\x99s establishment is not particularly brilliant\r\nin its housekeeping.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is always plenty, Herbert,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, to say something encouraging.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO yes! and so the dustman says, I believe, with the strongest approval,\r\nand so does the marine-store shop in the back street. Gravely, Handel,\r\nfor the subject is grave enough, you know how it is as well as I do. I\r\nsuppose there was a time once when my father had not given matters up;\r\nbut if ever there was, the time is gone. May I ask you if you have ever\r\nhad an opportunity of remarking, down in your part of the country,\r\nthat the children of not exactly suitable marriages are always most\r\nparticularly anxious to be married?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis was such a singular question, that I asked him in return, \xe2\x80\x9cIs it\r\nso?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know,\xe2\x80\x9d said Herbert, \xe2\x80\x9cthat\xe2\x80\x99s what I want to know. Because it\r\nis decidedly the case with us. My poor sister Charlotte, who was next me\r\nand died before she was fourteen, was a striking example. Little Jane\r\nis the same. In her desire to be matrimonially established, you\r\nmight suppose her to have passed her short existence in the perpetual\r\ncontemplation of domestic bliss. Little Alick in a frock has already\r\nmade arrangements for his union with a suitable young person at Kew. And\r\nindeed, I think we are all engaged, except the baby.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you are?\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am,\xe2\x80\x9d said Herbert; \xe2\x80\x9cbut it\xe2\x80\x99s a secret.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI assured him of my keeping the secret, and begged to be favored with\r\nfurther particulars. He had spoken so sensibly and feelingly of my\r\nweakness that I wanted to know something about his strength.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay I ask the name?\xe2\x80\x9d I said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cName of Clara,\xe2\x80\x9d said Herbert.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLive in London?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, perhaps I ought to mention,\xe2\x80\x9d said Herbert, who had become\r\ncuriously crestfallen and meek, since we entered on the interesting\r\ntheme, \xe2\x80\x9cthat she is rather below my mother\xe2\x80\x99s nonsensical family notions.\r\nHer father had to do with the victualling of passenger-ships. I think he\r\nwas a species of purser.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is he now?\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s an invalid now,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Herbert.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLiving on--?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn the first floor,\xe2\x80\x9d said Herbert. Which was not at all what I meant,\r\nfor I had intended my question to apply to his means. \xe2\x80\x9cI have never seen\r\nhim, for he has always kept his room overhead, since I have known Clara.\r\nBut I have heard him constantly. He makes tremendous rows,--roars, and\r\npegs at the floor with some frightful instrument.\xe2\x80\x9d In looking at me and\r\nthen laughing heartily, Herbert for the time recovered his usual lively\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you expect to see him?\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO yes, I constantly expect to see him,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Herbert, \xe2\x80\x9cbecause\r\nI never hear him, without expecting him to come tumbling through the\r\nceiling. But I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how long the rafters may hold.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen he had once more laughed heartily, he became meek again, and told\r\nme that the moment he began to realize Capital, it was his intention\r\nto marry this young lady. He added as a self-evident proposition,\r\nengendering low spirits, \xe2\x80\x9cBut you can\xe2\x80\x99t marry, you know, while you\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nlooking about you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs we contemplated the fire, and as I thought what a difficult vision to\r\nrealize this same Capital sometimes was, I put my hands in my pockets.\r\nA folded piece of paper in one of them attracting my attention, I opened\r\nit and found it to be the play-bill I had received from Joe, relative\r\nto the celebrated provincial amateur of Roscian renown. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd bless my\r\nheart,\xe2\x80\x9d I involuntarily added aloud, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s to-night!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis changed the subject in an instant, and made us hurriedly resolve\r\nto go to the play. So, when I had pledged myself to comfort and abet\r\nHerbert in the affair of his heart by all practicable and impracticable\r\nmeans, and when Herbert had told me that his affianced already knew me\r\nby reputation and that I should be presented to her, and when we had\r\nwarmly shaken hands upon our mutual confidence, we blew out our candles,\r\nmade up our fire, locked our door, and issued forth in quest of Mr.\r\nWopsle and Denmark.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXXI\r\n\r\nOn our arrival in Denmark, we found the king and queen of that country\r\nelevated in two arm-chairs on a kitchen-table, holding a Court. The\r\nwhole of the Danish nobility were in attendance; consisting of a noble\r\nboy in the wash-leather boots of a gigantic ancestor, a venerable Peer\r\nwith a dirty face who seemed to have risen from the people late in life,\r\nand the Danish chivalry with a comb in its hair and a pair of white\r\nsilk legs, and presenting on the whole a feminine appearance. My gifted\r\ntownsman stood gloomily apart, with folded arms, and I could have wished\r\nthat his curls and forehead had been more probable.\r\n\r\nSeveral curious little circumstances transpired as the action proceeded.\r\nThe late king of the country not only appeared to have been troubled\r\nwith a cough at the time of his decease, but to have taken it with him\r\nto the tomb, and to have brought it back. The royal phantom also carried\r\na ghostly manuscript round its truncheon, to which it had the appearance\r\nof occasionally referring, and that too, with an air of anxiety and a\r\ntendency to lose the place of reference which were suggestive of a state\r\nof mortality. It was this, I conceive, which led to the Shade\xe2\x80\x99s being\r\nadvised by the gallery to \xe2\x80\x9cturn over!\xe2\x80\x9d--a recommendation which it took\r\nextremely ill. It was likewise to be noted of this majestic spirit, that\r\nwhereas it always appeared with an air of having been out a long time\r\nand walked an immense distance, it perceptibly came from a closely\r\ncontiguous wall. This occasioned its terrors to be received derisively.\r\nThe Queen of Denmark, a very buxom lady, though no doubt historically\r\nbrazen, was considered by the public to have too much brass about her;\r\nher chin being attached to her diadem by a broad band of that metal (as\r\nif she had a gorgeous toothache), her waist being encircled by another,\r\nand each of her arms by another, so that she was openly mentioned\r\nas \xe2\x80\x9cthe kettle-drum.\xe2\x80\x9d The noble boy in the ancestral boots was\r\ninconsistent, representing himself, as it were in one breath, as an able\r\nseaman, a strolling actor, a grave-digger, a clergyman, and a person\r\nof the utmost importance at a Court fencing-match, on the authority\r\nof whose practised eye and nice discrimination the finest strokes were\r\njudged. This gradually led to a want of toleration for him, and even--on\r\nhis being detected in holy orders, and declining to perform the funeral\r\nservice--to the general indignation taking the form of nuts. Lastly,\r\nOphelia was a prey to such slow musical madness, that when, in course of\r\ntime, she had taken off her white muslin scarf, folded it up, and buried\r\nit, a sulky man who had been long cooling his impatient nose against an\r\niron bar in the front row of the gallery, growled, \xe2\x80\x9cNow the baby\xe2\x80\x99s put\r\nto bed let\xe2\x80\x99s have supper!\xe2\x80\x9d Which, to say the least of it, was out of\r\nkeeping.\r\n\r\nUpon my unfortunate townsman all these incidents accumulated with\r\nplayful effect. Whenever that undecided Prince had to ask a question or\r\nstate a doubt, the public helped him out with it. As for example; on the\r\nquestion whether \xe2\x80\x98twas nobler in the mind to suffer, some roared yes,\r\nand some no, and some inclining to both opinions said \xe2\x80\x9cToss up for\r\nit;\xe2\x80\x9d and quite a Debating Society arose. When he asked what should such\r\nfellows as he do crawling between earth and heaven, he was encouraged\r\nwith loud cries of \xe2\x80\x9cHear, hear!\xe2\x80\x9d When he appeared with his stocking\r\ndisordered (its disorder expressed, according to usage, by one very neat\r\nfold in the top, which I suppose to be always got up with a flat iron),\r\na conversation took place in the gallery respecting the paleness of his\r\nleg, and whether it was occasioned by the turn the ghost had given him.\r\nOn his taking the recorders,--very like a little black flute that had\r\njust been played in the orchestra and handed out at the door,--he was\r\ncalled upon unanimously for Rule Britannia. When he recommended the\r\nplayer not to saw the air thus, the sulky man said, \xe2\x80\x9cAnd don\xe2\x80\x99t you do\r\nit, neither; you\xe2\x80\x99re a deal worse than him!\xe2\x80\x9d And I grieve to add that\r\npeals of laughter greeted Mr. Wopsle on every one of these occasions.\r\n\r\nBut his greatest trials were in the churchyard, which had the appearance\r\nof a primeval forest, with a kind of small ecclesiastical wash-house\r\non one side, and a turnpike gate on the other. Mr. Wopsle in a\r\ncomprehensive black cloak, being descried entering at the turnpike,\r\nthe gravedigger was admonished in a friendly way, \xe2\x80\x9cLook out! Here\xe2\x80\x99s the\r\nundertaker a coming, to see how you\xe2\x80\x99re a getting on with your work!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n I believe it is well known in a constitutional country that Mr. Wopsle\r\ncould not possibly have returned the skull, after moralizing over it,\r\nwithout dusting his fingers on a white napkin taken from his breast;\r\nbut even that innocent and indispensable action did not pass without the\r\ncomment, \xe2\x80\x9cWai-ter!\xe2\x80\x9d The arrival of the body for interment (in an empty\r\nblack box with the lid tumbling open), was the signal for a general\r\njoy, which was much enhanced by the discovery, among the bearers, of\r\nan individual obnoxious to identification. The joy attended Mr. Wopsle\r\nthrough his struggle with Laertes on the brink of the orchestra and\r\nthe grave, and slackened no more until he had tumbled the king off the\r\nkitchen-table, and had died by inches from the ankles upward.\r\n\r\nWe had made some pale efforts in the beginning to applaud Mr. Wopsle;\r\nbut they were too hopeless to be persisted in. Therefore we had sat,\r\nfeeling keenly for him, but laughing, nevertheless, from ear to ear. I\r\nlaughed in spite of myself all the time, the whole thing was so droll;\r\nand yet I had a latent impression that there was something decidedly\r\nfine in Mr. Wopsle\xe2\x80\x99s elocution,--not for old associations\xe2\x80\x99 sake, I am\r\nafraid, but because it was very slow, very dreary, very uphill and\r\ndownhill, and very unlike any way in which any man in any natural\r\ncircumstances of life or death ever expressed himself about anything.\r\nWhen the tragedy was over, and he had been called for and hooted, I said\r\nto Herbert, \xe2\x80\x9cLet us go at once, or perhaps we shall meet him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe made all the haste we could downstairs, but we were not quick enough\r\neither. Standing at the door was a Jewish man with an unnatural heavy\r\nsmear of eyebrow, who caught my eyes as we advanced, and said, when we\r\ncame up with him,--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Pip and friend?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIdentity of Mr. Pip and friend confessed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Waldengarver,\xe2\x80\x9d said the man, \xe2\x80\x9cwould be glad to have the honor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWaldengarver?\xe2\x80\x9d I repeated--when Herbert murmured in my ear, \xe2\x80\x9cProbably\r\nWopsle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d said I. \xe2\x80\x9cYes. Shall we follow you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA few steps, please.\xe2\x80\x9d When we were in a side alley, he turned and\r\nasked, \xe2\x80\x9cHow did you think he looked?--I dressed him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t know what he had looked like, except a funeral; with the\r\naddition of a large Danish sun or star hanging round his neck by a\r\nblue ribbon, that had given him the appearance of being insured in some\r\nextraordinary Fire Office. But I said he had looked very nice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen he come to the grave,\xe2\x80\x9d said our conductor, \xe2\x80\x9che showed his cloak\r\nbeautiful. But, judging from the wing, it looked to me that when he\r\nsee the ghost in the queen\xe2\x80\x99s apartment, he might have made more of his\r\nstockings.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI modestly assented, and we all fell through a little dirty swing door,\r\ninto a sort of hot packing-case immediately behind it. Here Mr. Wopsle\r\nwas divesting himself of his Danish garments, and here there was just\r\nroom for us to look at him over one another\xe2\x80\x99s shoulders, by keeping the\r\npacking-case door, or lid, wide open.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGentlemen,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Wopsle, \xe2\x80\x9cI am proud to see you. I hope, Mr. Pip,\r\nyou will excuse my sending round. I had the happiness to know you in\r\nformer times, and the Drama has ever had a claim which has ever been\r\nacknowledged, on the noble and the affluent.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Mr. Waldengarver, in a frightful perspiration, was trying to\r\nget himself out of his princely sables.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSkin the stockings off Mr. Waldengarver,\xe2\x80\x9d said the owner of that\r\nproperty, \xe2\x80\x9cor you\xe2\x80\x99ll bust \xe2\x80\x98em. Bust \xe2\x80\x98em, and you\xe2\x80\x99ll bust five-and-thirty\r\nshillings. Shakspeare never was complimented with a finer pair. Keep\r\nquiet in your chair now, and leave \xe2\x80\x98em to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith that, he went upon his knees, and began to flay his victim; who, on\r\nthe first stocking coming off, would certainly have fallen over backward\r\nwith his chair, but for there being no room to fall anyhow.\r\n\r\nI had been afraid until then to say a word about the play. But then, Mr.\r\nWaldengarver looked up at us complacently, and said,--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGentlemen, how did it seem to you, to go, in front?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHerbert said from behind (at the same time poking me), \xe2\x80\x9cCapitally.\xe2\x80\x9d So I\r\nsaid \xe2\x80\x9cCapitally.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow did you like my reading of the character, gentlemen?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr.\r\nWaldengarver, almost, if not quite, with patronage.\r\n\r\nHerbert said from behind (again poking me), \xe2\x80\x9cMassive and concrete.\xe2\x80\x9d So I\r\nsaid boldly, as if I had originated it, and must beg to insist upon it,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMassive and concrete.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am glad to have your approbation, gentlemen,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Waldengarver,\r\nwith an air of dignity, in spite of his being ground against the wall at\r\nthe time, and holding on by the seat of the chair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you one thing, Mr. Waldengarver,\xe2\x80\x9d said the man who was on\r\nhis knees, \xe2\x80\x9cin which you\xe2\x80\x99re out in your reading. Now mind! I don\xe2\x80\x99t care\r\nwho says contrairy; I tell you so. You\xe2\x80\x99re out in your reading of Hamlet\r\nwhen you get your legs in profile. The last Hamlet as I dressed, made\r\nthe same mistakes in his reading at rehearsal, till I got him to put a\r\nlarge red wafer on each of his shins, and then at that rehearsal (which\r\nwas the last) I went in front, sir, to the back of the pit, and whenever\r\nhis reading brought him into profile, I called out \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t see no\r\nwafers!\xe2\x80\x9d And at night his reading was lovely.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Waldengarver smiled at me, as much as to say \xe2\x80\x9ca faithful\r\nDependent--I overlook his folly;\xe2\x80\x9d and then said aloud, \xe2\x80\x9cMy view is a\r\nlittle classic and thoughtful for them here; but they will improve, they\r\nwill improve.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHerbert and I said together, O, no doubt they would improve.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you observe, gentlemen,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Waldengarver, \xe2\x80\x9cthat there was a\r\nman in the gallery who endeavored to cast derision on the service,--I\r\nmean, the representation?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe basely replied that we rather thought we had noticed such a man. I\r\nadded, \xe2\x80\x9cHe was drunk, no doubt.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO dear no, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Wopsle, \xe2\x80\x9cnot drunk. His employer would see to\r\nthat, sir. His employer would not allow him to be drunk.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know his employer?\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\nMr. Wopsle shut his eyes, and opened them again; performing both\r\nceremonies very slowly. \xe2\x80\x9cYou must have observed, gentlemen,\xe2\x80\x9d said he,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9can ignorant and a blatant ass, with a rasping throat and a countenance\r\nexpressive of low malignity, who went through--I will not say\r\nsustained--the r\xc3\xb4le (if I may use a French expression) of Claudius, King\r\nof Denmark. That is his employer, gentlemen. Such is the profession!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWithout distinctly knowing whether I should have been more sorry for Mr.\r\nWopsle if he had been in despair, I was so sorry for him as it was,\r\nthat I took the opportunity of his turning round to have his braces\r\nput on,--which jostled us out at the doorway,--to ask Herbert what he\r\nthought of having him home to supper? Herbert said he thought it would\r\nbe kind to do so; therefore I invited him, and he went to Barnard\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwith us, wrapped up to the eyes, and we did our best for him, and he sat\r\nuntil two o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the morning, reviewing his success and developing\r\nhis plans. I forget in detail what they were, but I have a general\r\nrecollection that he was to begin with reviving the Drama, and to end\r\nwith crushing it; inasmuch as his decease would leave it utterly bereft\r\nand without a chance or hope.\r\n\r\nMiserably I went to bed after all, and miserably thought of Estella, and\r\nmiserably dreamed that my expectations were all cancelled, and that I\r\nhad to give my hand in marriage to Herbert\xe2\x80\x99s Clara, or play Hamlet to\r\nMiss Havisham\xe2\x80\x99s Ghost, before twenty thousand people, without knowing\r\ntwenty words of it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXXII\r\n\r\nOne day when I was busy with my books and Mr. Pocket, I received a note\r\nby the post, the mere outside of which threw me into a great flutter;\r\nfor, though I had never seen the handwriting in which it was addressed,\r\nI divined whose hand it was. It had no set beginning, as Dear Mr. Pip,\r\nor Dear Pip, or Dear Sir, or Dear Anything, but ran thus:--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am to come to London the day after to-morrow by the midday coach. I\r\nbelieve it was settled you should meet me? At all events Miss Havisham\r\nhas that impression, and I write in obedience to it. She sends you her\r\nregard.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYours, ESTELLA.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIf there had been time, I should probably have ordered several suits\r\nof clothes for this occasion; but as there was not, I was fain to be\r\ncontent with those I had. My appetite vanished instantly, and I knew\r\nno peace or rest until the day arrived. Not that its arrival brought\r\nme either; for, then I was worse than ever, and began haunting the\r\ncoach-office in Wood Street, Cheapside, before the coach had left the\r\nBlue Boar in our town. For all that I knew this perfectly well, I still\r\nfelt as if it were not safe to let the coach-office be out of my sight\r\nlonger than five minutes at a time; and in this condition of unreason I\r\nhad performed the first half-hour of a watch of four or five hours, when\r\nWemmick ran against me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHalloa, Mr. Pip,\xe2\x80\x9d said he; \xe2\x80\x9chow do you do? I should hardly have thought\r\nthis was your beat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI explained that I was waiting to meet somebody who was coming up by\r\ncoach, and I inquired after the Castle and the Aged.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBoth flourishing thankye,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wemmick, \xe2\x80\x9cand particularly the Aged.\r\nHe\xe2\x80\x99s in wonderful feather. He\xe2\x80\x99ll be eighty-two next birthday. I have\r\na notion of firing eighty-two times, if the neighborhood shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ncomplain, and that cannon of mine should prove equal to the pressure.\r\nHowever, this is not London talk. Where do you think I am going to?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo the office?\xe2\x80\x9d said I, for he was tending in that direction.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNext thing to it,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Wemmick, \xe2\x80\x9cI am going to Newgate. We are in\r\na banker\xe2\x80\x99s-parcel case just at present, and I have been down the road\r\ntaking a squint at the scene of action, and thereupon must have a word\r\nor two with our client.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid your client commit the robbery?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBless your soul and body, no,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Wemmick, very drily. \xe2\x80\x9cBut he\r\nis accused of it. So might you or I be. Either of us might be accused of\r\nit, you know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly neither of us is,\xe2\x80\x9d I remarked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYah!\xe2\x80\x9d said Wemmick, touching me on the breast with his forefinger;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99re a deep one, Mr. Pip! Would you like to have a look at Newgate?\r\nHave you time to spare?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI had so much time to spare, that the proposal came as a relief,\r\nnotwithstanding its irreconcilability with my latent desire to keep my\r\neye on the coach-office. Muttering that I would make the inquiry whether\r\nI had time to walk with him, I went into the office, and ascertained\r\nfrom the clerk with the nicest precision and much to the trying of his\r\ntemper, the earliest moment at which the coach could be expected,--which\r\nI knew beforehand, quite as well as he. I then rejoined Mr. Wemmick, and\r\naffecting to consult my watch, and to be surprised by the information I\r\nhad received, accepted his offer.\r\n\r\nWe were at Newgate in a few minutes, and we passed through the lodge\r\nwhere some fetters were hanging up on the bare walls among the prison\r\nrules, into the interior of the jail. At that time jails were much\r\nneglected, and the period of exaggerated reaction consequent on\r\nall public wrongdoing--and which is always its heaviest and longest\r\npunishment--was still far off. So, felons were not lodged and fed better\r\nthan soldiers (to say nothing of paupers), and seldom set fire to their\r\nprisons with the excusable object of improving the flavor of their soup.\r\nIt was visiting time when Wemmick took me in, and a potman was going his\r\nrounds with beer; and the prisoners, behind bars in yards, were buying\r\nbeer, and talking to friends; and a frowzy, ugly, disorderly, depressing\r\nscene it was.\r\n\r\nIt struck me that Wemmick walked among the prisoners much as a gardener\r\nmight walk among his plants. This was first put into my head by his\r\nseeing a shoot that had come up in the night, and saying, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat, Captain\r\nTom? Are you there? Ah, indeed!\xe2\x80\x9d and also, \xe2\x80\x9cIs that Black Bill behind\r\nthe cistern? Why I didn\xe2\x80\x99t look for you these two months; how do you find\r\nyourself?\xe2\x80\x9d Equally in his stopping at the bars and attending to\r\nanxious whisperers,--always singly,--Wemmick with his post-office in\r\nan immovable state, looked at them while in conference, as if he were\r\ntaking particular notice of the advance they had made, since last\r\nobserved, towards coming out in full blow at their trial.\r\n\r\nHe was highly popular, and I found that he took the familiar department\r\nof Mr. Jaggers\xe2\x80\x99s business; though something of the state of Mr. Jaggers\r\nhung about him too, forbidding approach beyond certain limits. His\r\npersonal recognition of each successive client was comprised in a nod,\r\nand in his settling his hat a little easier on his head with both\r\nhands, and then tightening the post-office, and putting his hands in his\r\npockets. In one or two instances there was a difficulty respecting the\r\nraising of fees, and then Mr. Wemmick, backing as far as possible from\r\nthe insufficient money produced, said, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s no use, my boy. I\xe2\x80\x99m only\r\na subordinate. I can\xe2\x80\x99t take it. Don\xe2\x80\x99t go on in that way with a\r\nsubordinate. If you are unable to make up your quantum, my boy, you had\r\nbetter address yourself to a principal; there are plenty of principals\r\nin the profession, you know, and what is not worth the while of one, may\r\nbe worth the while of another; that\xe2\x80\x99s my recommendation to you, speaking\r\nas a subordinate. Don\xe2\x80\x99t try on useless measures. Why should you? Now,\r\nwho\xe2\x80\x99s next?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThus, we walked through Wemmick\xe2\x80\x99s greenhouse, until he turned to me and\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x9cNotice the man I shall shake hands with.\xe2\x80\x9d I should have done so,\r\nwithout the preparation, as he had shaken hands with no one yet.\r\n\r\nAlmost as soon as he had spoken, a portly upright man (whom I can\r\nsee now, as I write) in a well-worn olive-colored frock-coat, with a\r\npeculiar pallor overspreading the red in his complexion, and eyes that\r\nwent wandering about when he tried to fix them, came up to a corner\r\nof the bars, and put his hand to his hat--which had a greasy and fatty\r\nsurface like cold broth--with a half-serious and half-jocose military\r\nsalute.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cColonel, to you!\xe2\x80\x9d said Wemmick; \xe2\x80\x9chow are you, Colonel?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right, Mr. Wemmick.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEverything was done that could be done, but the evidence was too strong\r\nfor us, Colonel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, it was too strong, sir,--but I don\xe2\x80\x99t care.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wemmick, coolly, \xe2\x80\x9cyou don\xe2\x80\x99t care.\xe2\x80\x9d Then, turning to me,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cServed His Majesty this man. Was a soldier in the line and bought his\r\ndischarge.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI said, \xe2\x80\x9cIndeed?\xe2\x80\x9d and the man\xe2\x80\x99s eyes looked at me, and then looked over\r\nmy head, and then looked all round me, and then he drew his hand across\r\nhis lips and laughed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think I shall be out of this on Monday, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to Wemmick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps,\xe2\x80\x9d returned my friend, \xe2\x80\x9cbut there\xe2\x80\x99s no knowing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am glad to have the chance of bidding you good-bye, Mr. Wemmick,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nthe man, stretching out his hand between two bars.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThankye,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wemmick, shaking hands with him. \xe2\x80\x9cSame to you, Colonel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf what I had upon me when taken had been real, Mr. Wemmick,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nman, unwilling to let his hand go, \xe2\x80\x9cI should have asked the favor of\r\nyour wearing another ring--in acknowledgment of your attentions.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll accept the will for the deed,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wemmick. \xe2\x80\x9cBy the by; you were\r\nquite a pigeon-fancier.\xe2\x80\x9d The man looked up at the sky. \xe2\x80\x9cI am told you\r\nhad a remarkable breed of tumblers. Could you commission any friend of\r\nyours to bring me a pair, if you\xe2\x80\x99ve no further use for \xe2\x80\x98em?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt shall be done, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wemmick, \xe2\x80\x9cthey shall be taken care of. Good afternoon,\r\nColonel. Good-bye!\xe2\x80\x9d They shook hands again, and as we walked away Wemmick\r\nsaid to me, \xe2\x80\x9cA Coiner, a very good workman. The Recorder\xe2\x80\x99s report is\r\nmade to-day, and he is sure to be executed on Monday. Still you see, as\r\nfar as it goes, a pair of pigeons are portable property all the same.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n With that, he looked back, and nodded at this dead plant, and then cast\r\nhis eyes about him in walking out of the yard, as if he were considering\r\nwhat other pot would go best in its place.\r\n\r\nAs we came out of the prison through the lodge, I found that the great\r\nimportance of my guardian was appreciated by the turnkeys, no less\r\nthan by those whom they held in charge. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, Mr. Wemmick,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nturnkey, who kept us between the two studded and spiked lodge gates,\r\nand who carefully locked one before he unlocked the other, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat\xe2\x80\x99s Mr.\r\nJaggers going to do with that water-side murder? Is he going to make it\r\nmanslaughter, or what\xe2\x80\x99s he going to make of it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy don\xe2\x80\x99t you ask him?\xe2\x80\x9d returned Wemmick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO yes, I dare say!\xe2\x80\x9d said the turnkey.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, that\xe2\x80\x99s the way with them here, Mr. Pip,\xe2\x80\x9d remarked Wemmick, turning\r\nto me with his post-office elongated. \xe2\x80\x9cThey don\xe2\x80\x99t mind what they ask of\r\nme, the subordinate; but you\xe2\x80\x99ll never catch \xe2\x80\x98em asking any questions of\r\nmy principal.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs this young gentleman one of the \xe2\x80\x98prentices or articled ones of your\r\noffice?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the turnkey, with a grin at Mr. Wemmick\xe2\x80\x99s humor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere he goes again, you see!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Wemmick, \xe2\x80\x9cI told you so! Asks\r\nanother question of the subordinate before his first is dry! Well,\r\nsupposing Mr. Pip is one of them?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy then,\xe2\x80\x9d said the turnkey, grinning again, \xe2\x80\x9che knows what Mr. Jaggers\r\nis.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYah!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Wemmick, suddenly hitting out at the turnkey in a facetious\r\nway, \xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99re dumb as one of your own keys when you have to do with my\r\nprincipal, you know you are. Let us out, you old fox, or I\xe2\x80\x99ll get him to\r\nbring an action against you for false imprisonment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe turnkey laughed, and gave us good day, and stood laughing at us over\r\nthe spikes of the wicket when we descended the steps into the street.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMind you, Mr. Pip,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wemmick, gravely in my ear, as he took my arm\r\nto be more confidential; \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know that Mr. Jaggers does a better\r\nthing than the way in which he keeps himself so high. He\xe2\x80\x99s always so\r\nhigh. His constant height is of a piece with his immense abilities. That\r\nColonel durst no more take leave of him, than that turnkey durst ask him\r\nhis intentions respecting a case. Then, between his height and them, he\r\nslips in his subordinate,--don\xe2\x80\x99t you see?--and so he has \xe2\x80\x98em, soul and\r\nbody.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI was very much impressed, and not for the first time, by my guardian\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsubtlety. To confess the truth, I very heartily wished, and not for the\r\nfirst time, that I had had some other guardian of minor abilities.\r\n\r\nMr. Wemmick and I parted at the office in Little Britain, where\r\nsuppliants for Mr. Jaggers\xe2\x80\x99s notice were lingering about as usual, and I\r\nreturned to my watch in the street of the coach-office, with some three\r\nhours on hand. I consumed the whole time in thinking how strange it\r\nwas that I should be encompassed by all this taint of prison and crime;\r\nthat, in my childhood out on our lonely marshes on a winter evening, I\r\nshould have first encountered it; that, it should have reappeared on two\r\noccasions, starting out like a stain that was faded but not gone; that,\r\nit should in this new way pervade my fortune and advancement. While my\r\nmind was thus engaged, I thought of the beautiful young Estella, proud\r\nand refined, coming towards me, and I thought with absolute abhorrence\r\nof the contrast between the jail and her. I wished that Wemmick had not\r\nmet me, or that I had not yielded to him and gone with him, so that,\r\nof all days in the year on this day, I might not have had Newgate in\r\nmy breath and on my clothes. I beat the prison dust off my feet as I\r\nsauntered to and fro, and I shook it out of my dress, and I exhaled\r\nits air from my lungs. So contaminated did I feel, remembering who was\r\ncoming, that the coach came quickly after all, and I was not yet free\r\nfrom the soiling consciousness of Mr. Wemmick\xe2\x80\x99s conservatory, when I saw\r\nher face at the coach window and her hand waving to me.\r\n\r\nWhat was the nameless shadow which again in that one instant had passed?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXXIII\r\n\r\nIn her furred travelling-dress, Estella seemed more delicately beautiful\r\nthan she had ever seemed yet, even in my eyes. Her manner was more\r\nwinning than she had cared to let it be to me before, and I thought I\r\nsaw Miss Havisham\xe2\x80\x99s influence in the change.\r\n\r\nWe stood in the Inn Yard while she pointed out her luggage to me, and\r\nwhen it was all collected I remembered--having forgotten everything but\r\nherself in the meanwhile--that I knew nothing of her destination.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am going to Richmond,\xe2\x80\x9d she told me. \xe2\x80\x9cOur lesson is, that there are\r\ntwo Richmonds, one in Surrey and one in Yorkshire, and that mine is the\r\nSurrey Richmond. The distance is ten miles. I am to have a carriage, and\r\nyou are to take me. This is my purse, and you are to pay my charges out\r\nof it. O, you must take the purse! We have no choice, you and I, but to\r\nobey our instructions. We are not free to follow our own devices, you\r\nand I.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs she looked at me in giving me the purse, I hoped there was an\r\ninner meaning in her words. She said them slightingly, but not with\r\ndispleasure.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA carriage will have to be sent for, Estella. Will you rest here a\r\nlittle?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I am to rest here a little, and I am to drink some tea, and you\r\nare to take care of me the while.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe drew her arm through mine, as if it must be done, and I requested a\r\nwaiter who had been staring at the coach like a man who had never seen\r\nsuch a thing in his life, to show us a private sitting-room. Upon that,\r\nhe pulled out a napkin, as if it were a magic clew without which he\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t find the way upstairs, and led us to the black hole of the\r\nestablishment, fitted up with a diminishing mirror (quite a superfluous\r\narticle, considering the hole\xe2\x80\x99s proportions), an anchovy sauce-cruet,\r\nand somebody\xe2\x80\x99s pattens. On my objecting to this retreat, he took us into\r\nanother room with a dinner-table for thirty, and in the grate a scorched\r\nleaf of a copy-book under a bushel of coal-dust. Having looked at this\r\nextinct conflagration and shaken his head, he took my order; which,\r\nproving to be merely, \xe2\x80\x9cSome tea for the lady,\xe2\x80\x9d sent him out of the room\r\nin a very low state of mind.\r\n\r\nI was, and I am, sensible that the air of this chamber, in its strong\r\ncombination of stable with soup-stock, might have led one to infer that\r\nthe coaching department was not doing well, and that the enterprising\r\nproprietor was boiling down the horses for the refreshment department.\r\nYet the room was all in all to me, Estella being in it. I thought that\r\nwith her I could have been happy there for life. (I was not at all happy\r\nthere at the time, observe, and I knew it well.)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere are you going to, at Richmond?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked Estella.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am going to live,\xe2\x80\x9d said she, \xe2\x80\x9cat a great expense, with a lady there,\r\nwho has the power--or says she has--of taking me about, and introducing\r\nme, and showing people to me and showing me to people.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose you will be glad of variety and admiration?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I suppose so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe answered so carelessly, that I said, \xe2\x80\x9cYou speak of yourself as if\r\nyou were some one else.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere did you learn how I speak of others? Come, come,\xe2\x80\x9d said Estella,\r\nsmiling delightfully, \xe2\x80\x9cyou must not expect me to go to school to you; I\r\nmust talk in my own way. How do you thrive with Mr. Pocket?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI live quite pleasantly there; at least--\xe2\x80\x9d It appeared to me that I was\r\nlosing a chance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt least?\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Estella.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs pleasantly as I could anywhere, away from you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou silly boy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Estella, quite composedly, \xe2\x80\x9chow can you talk such\r\nnonsense? Your friend Mr. Matthew, I believe, is superior to the rest of\r\nhis family?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery superior indeed. He is nobody\xe2\x80\x99s enemy--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t add but his own,\xe2\x80\x9d interposed Estella, \xe2\x80\x9cfor I hate that class of\r\nman. But he really is disinterested, and above small jealousy and spite,\r\nI have heard?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am sure I have every reason to say so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have not every reason to say so of the rest of his people,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nEstella, nodding at me with an expression of face that was at once\r\ngrave and rallying, \xe2\x80\x9cfor they beset Miss Havisham with reports and\r\ninsinuations to your disadvantage. They watch you, misrepresent you,\r\nwrite letters about you (anonymous sometimes), and you are the torment\r\nand the occupation of their lives. You can scarcely realize to yourself\r\nthe hatred those people feel for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey do me no harm, I hope?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nInstead of answering, Estella burst out laughing. This was very singular\r\nto me, and I looked at her in considerable perplexity. When she left\r\noff--and she had not laughed languidly, but with real enjoyment--I said,\r\nin my diffident way with her,--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope I may suppose that you would not be amused if they did me any\r\nharm.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no you may be sure of that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Estella. \xe2\x80\x9cYou may be certain that\r\nI laugh because they fail. O, those people with Miss Havisham, and the\r\ntortures they undergo!\xe2\x80\x9d She laughed again, and even now when she had\r\ntold me why, her laughter was very singular to me, for I could not\r\ndoubt its being genuine, and yet it seemed too much for the occasion.\r\nI thought there must really be something more here than I knew; she saw\r\nthe thought in my mind, and answered it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is not easy for even you.\xe2\x80\x9d said Estella, \xe2\x80\x9cto know what satisfaction\r\nit gives me to see those people thwarted, or what an enjoyable sense of\r\nthe ridiculous I have when they are made ridiculous. For you were not\r\nbrought up in that strange house from a mere baby. I was. You had not\r\nyour little wits sharpened by their intriguing against you, suppressed\r\nand defenceless, under the mask of sympathy and pity and what not that\r\nis soft and soothing. I had. You did not gradually open your round\r\nchildish eyes wider and wider to the discovery of that impostor of a\r\nwoman who calculates her stores of peace of mind for when she wakes up\r\nin the night. I did.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was no laughing matter with Estella now, nor was she summoning these\r\nremembrances from any shallow place. I would not have been the cause of\r\nthat look of hers for all my expectations in a heap.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwo things I can tell you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Estella. \xe2\x80\x9cFirst, notwithstanding the\r\nproverb that constant dropping will wear away a stone, you may set\r\nyour mind at rest that these people never will--never would, in hundred\r\nyears--impair your ground with Miss Havisham, in any particular, great\r\nor small. Second, I am beholden to you as the cause of their being so\r\nbusy and so mean in vain, and there is my hand upon it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs she gave it to me playfully,--for her darker mood had been but\r\nMomentary,--I held it and put it to my lips. \xe2\x80\x9cYou ridiculous boy,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nEstella, \xe2\x80\x9cwill you never take warning? Or do you kiss my hand in the\r\nsame spirit in which I once let you kiss my cheek?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat spirit was that?\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI must think a moment. A spirit of contempt for the fawners and\r\nplotters.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I say yes, may I kiss the cheek again?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou should have asked before you touched the hand. But, yes, if you\r\nlike.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI leaned down, and her calm face was like a statue\xe2\x80\x99s. \xe2\x80\x9cNow,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nEstella, gliding away the instant I touched her cheek, \xe2\x80\x9cyou are to take\r\ncare that I have some tea, and you are to take me to Richmond.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer reverting to this tone as if our association were forced upon\r\nus, and we were mere puppets, gave me pain; but everything in our\r\nintercourse did give me pain. Whatever her tone with me happened to be,\r\nI could put no trust in it, and build no hope on it; and yet I went on\r\nagainst trust and against hope. Why repeat it a thousand times? So it\r\nalways was.\r\n\r\nI rang for the tea, and the waiter, reappearing with his magic clew,\r\nbrought in by degrees some fifty adjuncts to that refreshment, but of\r\ntea not a glimpse. A teaboard, cups and saucers, plates, knives and\r\nforks (including carvers), spoons (various), saltcellars, a meek little\r\nmuffin confined with the utmost precaution under a strong iron cover,\r\nMoses in the bulrushes typified by a soft bit of butter in a quantity of\r\nparsley, a pale loaf with a powdered head, two proof impressions of\r\nthe bars of the kitchen fireplace on triangular bits of bread, and\r\nultimately a fat family urn; which the waiter staggered in with,\r\nexpressing in his countenance burden and suffering. After a prolonged\r\nabsence at this stage of the entertainment, he at length came back with\r\na casket of precious appearance containing twigs. These I steeped in hot\r\nwater, and so from the whole of these appliances extracted one cup of I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t know what for Estella.\r\n\r\nThe bill paid, and the waiter remembered, and the ostler not forgotten,\r\nand the chambermaid taken into consideration,--in a word, the whole\r\nhouse bribed into a state of contempt and animosity, and Estella\xe2\x80\x99s purse\r\nmuch lightened,--we got into our post-coach and drove away. Turning into\r\nCheapside and rattling up Newgate Street, we were soon under the walls\r\nof which I was so ashamed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat place is that?\xe2\x80\x9d Estella asked me.\r\n\r\nI made a foolish pretence of not at first recognizing it, and then\r\ntold her. As she looked at it, and drew in her head again,\r\nmurmuring, \xe2\x80\x9cWretches!\xe2\x80\x9d I would not have confessed to my visit for any\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Jaggers,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, by way of putting it neatly on somebody else,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9chas the reputation of being more in the secrets of that dismal place\r\nthan any man in London.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe is more in the secrets of every place, I think,\xe2\x80\x9d said Estella, in a\r\nlow voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have been accustomed to see him often, I suppose?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have been accustomed to see him at uncertain intervals, ever since\r\nI can remember. But I know him no better now, than I did before I could\r\nspeak plainly. What is your own experience of him? Do you advance with\r\nhim?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnce habituated to his distrustful manner,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cI have done very\r\nwell.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you intimate?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have dined with him at his private house.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI fancy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Estella, shrinking \xe2\x80\x9cthat must be a curious place.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is a curious place.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI should have been chary of discussing my guardian too freely even with\r\nher; but I should have gone on with the subject so far as to describe\r\nthe dinner in Gerrard Street, if we had not then come into a sudden\r\nglare of gas. It seemed, while it lasted, to be all alight and alive\r\nwith that inexplicable feeling I had had before; and when we were out of\r\nit, I was as much dazed for a few moments as if I had been in lightning.\r\n\r\nSo we fell into other talk, and it was principally about the way by\r\nwhich we were travelling, and about what parts of London lay on this\r\nside of it, and what on that. The great city was almost new to her, she\r\ntold me, for she had never left Miss Havisham\xe2\x80\x99s neighborhood until she\r\nhad gone to France, and she had merely passed through London then in\r\ngoing and returning. I asked her if my guardian had any charge of her\r\nwhile she remained here? To that she emphatically said \xe2\x80\x9cGod forbid!\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\nno more.\r\n\r\nIt was impossible for me to avoid seeing that she cared to attract me;\r\nthat she made herself winning, and would have won me even if the task\r\nhad needed pains. Yet this made me none the happier, for even if she had\r\nnot taken that tone of our being disposed of by others, I should have\r\nfelt that she held my heart in her hand because she wilfully chose to do\r\nit, and not because it would have wrung any tenderness in her to crush\r\nit and throw it away.\r\n\r\nWhen we passed through Hammersmith, I showed her where Mr. Matthew\r\nPocket lived, and said it was no great way from Richmond, and that I\r\nhoped I should see her sometimes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO yes, you are to see me; you are to come when you think proper; you\r\nare to be mentioned to the family; indeed you are already mentioned.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI inquired was it a large household she was going to be a member of?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; there are only two; mother and daughter. The mother is a lady of\r\nsome station, though not averse to increasing her income.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wonder Miss Havisham could part with you again so soon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is a part of Miss Havisham\xe2\x80\x99s plans for me, Pip,\xe2\x80\x9d said Estella, with\r\na sigh, as if she were tired; \xe2\x80\x9cI am to write to her constantly and see\r\nher regularly and report how I go on,--I and the jewels,--for they are\r\nnearly all mine now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was the first time she had ever called me by my name. Of course she\r\ndid so purposely, and knew that I should treasure it up.\r\n\r\nWe came to Richmond all too soon, and our destination there was a house\r\nby the green,--a staid old house, where hoops and powder and patches,\r\nembroidered coats, rolled stockings, ruffles and swords, had had their\r\ncourt days many a time. Some ancient trees before the house were still\r\ncut into fashions as formal and unnatural as the hoops and wigs and\r\nstiff skirts; but their own allotted places in the great procession of\r\nthe dead were not far off, and they would soon drop into them and go the\r\nsilent way of the rest.\r\n\r\nA bell with an old voice--which I dare say in its time had often said\r\nto the house, Here is the green farthingale, Here is the diamond-hilted\r\nsword, Here are the shoes with red heels and the blue solitaire--sounded\r\ngravely in the moonlight, and two cherry-colored maids came fluttering\r\nout to receive Estella. The doorway soon absorbed her boxes, and she\r\ngave me her hand and a smile, and said good night, and was absorbed\r\nlikewise. And still I stood looking at the house, thinking how happy I\r\nshould be if I lived there with her, and knowing that I never was happy\r\nwith her, but always miserable.\r\n\r\nI got into the carriage to be taken back to Hammersmith, and I got in\r\nwith a bad heart-ache, and I got out with a worse heart-ache. At our\r\nown door, I found little Jane Pocket coming home from a little party\r\nescorted by her little lover; and I envied her little lover, in spite of\r\nhis being subject to Flopson.\r\n\r\nMr. Pocket was out lecturing; for, he was a most delightful lecturer on\r\ndomestic economy, and his treatises on the management of children and\r\nservants were considered the very best text-books on those themes. But\r\nMrs. Pocket was at home, and was in a little difficulty, on account of\r\nthe baby\xe2\x80\x99s having been accommodated with a needle-case to keep him quiet\r\nduring the unaccountable absence (with a relative in the Foot Guards)\r\nof Millers. And more needles were missing than it could be regarded\r\nas quite wholesome for a patient of such tender years either to apply\r\nexternally or to take as a tonic.\r\n\r\nMr. Pocket being justly celebrated for giving most excellent practical\r\nadvice, and for having a clear and sound perception of things and a\r\nhighly judicious mind, I had some notion in my heart-ache of begging him\r\nto accept my confidence. But happening to look up at Mrs. Pocket as she\r\nsat reading her book of dignities after prescribing Bed as a sovereign\r\nremedy for baby, I thought--Well--No, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXXIV\r\n\r\nAs I had grown accustomed to my expectations, I had insensibly begun to\r\nnotice their effect upon myself and those around me. Their influence on\r\nmy own character I disguised from my recognition as much as possible,\r\nbut I knew very well that it was not all good. I lived in a state of\r\nchronic uneasiness respecting my behavior to Joe. My conscience was not\r\nby any means comfortable about Biddy. When I woke up in the night,--like\r\nCamilla,--I used to think, with a weariness on my spirits, that I should\r\nhave been happier and better if I had never seen Miss Havisham\xe2\x80\x99s face,\r\nand had risen to manhood content to be partners with Joe in the honest\r\nold forge. Many a time of an evening, when I sat alone looking at the\r\nfire, I thought, after all there was no fire like the forge fire and the\r\nkitchen fire at home.\r\n\r\nYet Estella was so inseparable from all my restlessness and disquiet of\r\nmind, that I really fell into confusion as to the limits of my own part\r\nin its production. That is to say, supposing I had had no expectations,\r\nand yet had had Estella to think of, I could not make out to my\r\nsatisfaction that I should have done much better. Now, concerning the\r\ninfluence of my position on others, I was in no such difficulty, and so\r\nI perceived--though dimly enough perhaps--that it was not beneficial\r\nto anybody, and, above all, that it was not beneficial to Herbert.\r\nMy lavish habits led his easy nature into expenses that he could not\r\nafford, corrupted the simplicity of his life, and disturbed his peace\r\nwith anxieties and regrets. I was not at all remorseful for having\r\nunwittingly set those other branches of the Pocket family to the poor\r\narts they practised; because such littlenesses were their natural\r\nbent, and would have been evoked by anybody else, if I had left them\r\nslumbering. But Herbert\xe2\x80\x99s was a very different case, and it often caused\r\nme a twinge to think that I had done him evil service in crowding his\r\nsparely furnished chambers with incongruous upholstery work, and placing\r\nthe Canary-breasted Avenger at his disposal.\r\n\r\nSo now, as an infallible way of making little ease great ease, I began\r\nto contract a quantity of debt. I could hardly begin but Herbert\r\nmust begin too, so he soon followed. At Startop\xe2\x80\x99s suggestion, we put\r\nourselves down for election into a club called The Finches of the Grove:\r\nthe object of which institution I have never divined, if it were not\r\nthat the members should dine expensively once a fortnight, to quarrel\r\namong themselves as much as possible after dinner, and to cause six\r\nwaiters to get drunk on the stairs. I know that these gratifying social\r\nends were so invariably accomplished, that Herbert and I understood\r\nnothing else to be referred to in the first standing toast of the\r\nsociety: which ran \xe2\x80\x9cGentlemen, may the present promotion of good feeling\r\never reign predominant among the Finches of the Grove.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe Finches spent their money foolishly (the Hotel we dined at was\r\nin Covent Garden), and the first Finch I saw when I had the honor of\r\njoining the Grove was Bentley Drummle, at that time floundering about\r\ntown in a cab of his own, and doing a great deal of damage to the posts\r\nat the street corners. Occasionally, he shot himself out of his equipage\r\nheadforemost over the apron; and I saw him on one occasion deliver\r\nhimself at the door of the Grove in this unintentional way--like coals.\r\nBut here I anticipate a little, for I was not a Finch, and could not be,\r\naccording to the sacred laws of the society, until I came of age.\r\n\r\nIn my confidence in my own resources, I would willingly have taken\r\nHerbert\xe2\x80\x99s expenses on myself; but Herbert was proud, and I could make\r\nno such proposal to him. So he got into difficulties in every direction,\r\nand continued to look about him. When we gradually fell into keeping\r\nlate hours and late company, I noticed that he looked about him with a\r\ndesponding eye at breakfast-time; that he began to look about him more\r\nhopefully about mid-day; that he drooped when he came into dinner;\r\nthat he seemed to descry Capital in the distance, rather clearly, after\r\ndinner; that he all but realized Capital towards midnight; and that at\r\nabout two o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the morning, he became so deeply despondent again\r\nas to talk of buying a rifle and going to America, with a general\r\npurpose of compelling buffaloes to make his fortune.\r\n\r\nI was usually at Hammersmith about half the week, and when I was at\r\nHammersmith I haunted Richmond, whereof separately by and by. Herbert\r\nwould often come to Hammersmith when I was there, and I think at those\r\nseasons his father would occasionally have some passing perception that\r\nthe opening he was looking for, had not appeared yet. But in the general\r\ntumbling up of the family, his tumbling out in life somewhere, was\r\na thing to transact itself somehow. In the meantime Mr. Pocket grew\r\ngrayer, and tried oftener to lift himself out of his perplexities by the\r\nhair. While Mrs. Pocket tripped up the family with her footstool, read\r\nher book of dignities, lost her pocket-handkerchief, told us about her\r\ngrandpapa, and taught the young idea how to shoot, by shooting it into\r\nbed whenever it attracted her notice.\r\n\r\nAs I am now generalizing a period of my life with the object of clearing\r\nmy way before me, I can scarcely do so better than by at once completing\r\nthe description of our usual manners and customs at Barnard\xe2\x80\x99s Inn.\r\n\r\nWe spent as much money as we could, and got as little for it as people\r\ncould make up their minds to give us. We were always more or less\r\nmiserable, and most of our acquaintance were in the same condition.\r\nThere was a gay fiction among us that we were constantly enjoying\r\nourselves, and a skeleton truth that we never did. To the best of my\r\nbelief, our case was in the last aspect a rather common one.\r\n\r\nEvery morning, with an air ever new, Herbert went into the City to look\r\nabout him. I often paid him a visit in the dark back-room in which\r\nhe consorted with an ink-jar, a hat-peg, a coal-box, a string-box, an\r\nalmanac, a desk and stool, and a ruler; and I do not remember that I\r\never saw him do anything else but look about him. If we all did what\r\nwe undertake to do, as faithfully as Herbert did, we might live in a\r\nRepublic of the Virtues. He had nothing else to do, poor fellow, except\r\nat a certain hour of every afternoon to \xe2\x80\x9cgo to Lloyd\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x9d--in observance\r\nof a ceremony of seeing his principal, I think. He never did anything\r\nelse in connection with Lloyd\xe2\x80\x99s that I could find out, except come back\r\nagain. When he felt his case unusually serious, and that he positively\r\nmust find an opening, he would go on \xe2\x80\x98Change at a busy time, and walk in\r\nand out, in a kind of gloomy country dance figure, among the assembled\r\nmagnates. \xe2\x80\x9cFor,\xe2\x80\x9d says Herbert to me, coming home to dinner on one\r\nof those special occasions, \xe2\x80\x9cI find the truth to be, Handel, that an\r\nopening won\xe2\x80\x99t come to one, but one must go to it,--so I have been.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIf we had been less attached to one another, I think we must have hated\r\none another regularly every morning. I detested the chambers beyond\r\nexpression at that period of repentance, and could not endure the\r\nsight of the Avenger\xe2\x80\x99s livery; which had a more expensive and a\r\nless remunerative appearance then than at any other time in the\r\nfour-and-twenty hours. As we got more and more into debt, breakfast\r\nbecame a hollower and hollower form, and, being on one occasion at\r\nbreakfast-time threatened (by letter) with legal proceedings, \xe2\x80\x9cnot\r\nunwholly unconnected,\xe2\x80\x9d as my local paper might put it, \xe2\x80\x9cwith jewelery,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n I went so far as to seize the Avenger by his blue collar and shake\r\nhim off his feet,--so that he was actually in the air, like a booted\r\nCupid,--for presuming to suppose that we wanted a roll.\r\n\r\nAt certain times--meaning at uncertain times, for they depended on our\r\nhumor--I would say to Herbert, as if it were a remarkable discovery,--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear Herbert, we are getting on badly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear Handel,\xe2\x80\x9d Herbert would say to me, in all sincerity, \xe2\x80\x9cif you will\r\nbelieve me, those very words were on my lips, by a strange coincidence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen, Herbert,\xe2\x80\x9d I would respond, \xe2\x80\x9clet us look into our affairs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe always derived profound satisfaction from making an appointment for\r\nthis purpose. I always thought this was business, this was the way to\r\nconfront the thing, this was the way to take the foe by the throat. And\r\nI know Herbert thought so too.\r\n\r\nWe ordered something rather special for dinner, with a bottle of\r\nsomething similarly out of the common way, in order that our minds might\r\nbe fortified for the occasion, and we might come well up to the mark.\r\nDinner over, we produced a bundle of pens, a copious supply of ink, and\r\na goodly show of writing and blotting paper. For there was something\r\nvery comfortable in having plenty of stationery.\r\n\r\nI would then take a sheet of paper, and write across the top of it, in a\r\nneat hand, the heading, \xe2\x80\x9cMemorandum of Pip\xe2\x80\x99s debts\xe2\x80\x9d; with Barnard\xe2\x80\x99s Inn\r\nand the date very carefully added. Herbert would also take a sheet of\r\npaper, and write across it with similar formalities, \xe2\x80\x9cMemorandum of\r\nHerbert\xe2\x80\x99s debts.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEach of us would then refer to a confused heap of papers at his side,\r\nwhich had been thrown into drawers, worn into holes in pockets, half\r\nburnt in lighting candles, stuck for weeks into the looking-glass, and\r\notherwise damaged. The sound of our pens going refreshed us exceedingly,\r\ninsomuch that I sometimes found it difficult to distinguish between this\r\nedifying business proceeding and actually paying the money. In point of\r\nmeritorious character, the two things seemed about equal.\r\n\r\nWhen we had written a little while, I would ask Herbert how he got on?\r\nHerbert probably would have been scratching his head in a most rueful\r\nmanner at the sight of his accumulating figures.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are mounting up, Handel,\xe2\x80\x9d Herbert would say; \xe2\x80\x9cupon my life, they\r\nare mounting up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBe firm, Herbert,\xe2\x80\x9d I would retort, plying my own pen with great\r\nassiduity. \xe2\x80\x9cLook the thing in the face. Look into your affairs. Stare\r\nthem out of countenance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo I would, Handel, only they are staring me out of countenance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHowever, my determined manner would have its effect, and Herbert would\r\nfall to work again. After a time he would give up once more, on the plea\r\nthat he had not got Cobbs\xe2\x80\x99s bill, or Lobbs\xe2\x80\x99s, or Nobbs\xe2\x80\x99s, as the case\r\nmight be.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen, Herbert, estimate; estimate it in round numbers, and put it\r\ndown.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a fellow of resource you are!\xe2\x80\x9d my friend would reply, with\r\nadmiration. \xe2\x80\x9cReally your business powers are very remarkable.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI thought so too. I established with myself, on these occasions,\r\nthe reputation of a first-rate man of business,--prompt, decisive,\r\nenergetic, clear, cool-headed. When I had got all my responsibilities\r\ndown upon my list, I compared each with the bill, and ticked it off. My\r\nself-approval when I ticked an entry was quite a luxurious sensation.\r\nWhen I had no more ticks to make, I folded all my bills up uniformly,\r\ndocketed each on the back, and tied the whole into a symmetrical\r\nbundle. Then I did the same for Herbert (who modestly said he had not my\r\nadministrative genius), and felt that I had brought his affairs into a\r\nfocus for him.\r\n\r\nMy business habits had one other bright feature, which I called \xe2\x80\x9cleaving\r\na Margin.\xe2\x80\x9d For example; supposing Herbert\xe2\x80\x99s debts to be one hundred and\r\nsixty-four pounds four-and-twopence, I would say, \xe2\x80\x9cLeave a margin, and\r\nput them down at two hundred.\xe2\x80\x9d Or, supposing my own to be four times as\r\nmuch, I would leave a margin, and put them down at seven hundred. I had\r\nthe highest opinion of the wisdom of this same Margin, but I am bound\r\nto acknowledge that on looking back, I deem it to have been an expensive\r\ndevice. For, we always ran into new debt immediately, to the full extent\r\nof the margin, and sometimes, in the sense of freedom and solvency it\r\nimparted, got pretty far on into another margin.\r\n\r\nBut there was a calm, a rest, a virtuous hush, consequent on these\r\nexaminations of our affairs that gave me, for the time, an admirable\r\nopinion of myself. Soothed by my exertions, my method, and Herbert\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncompliments, I would sit with his symmetrical bundle and my own on the\r\ntable before me among the stationary, and feel like a Bank of some sort,\r\nrather than a private individual.\r\n\r\nWe shut our outer door on these solemn occasions, in order that we might\r\nnot be interrupted. I had fallen into my serene state one evening, when\r\nwe heard a letter dropped through the slit in the said door, and fall on\r\nthe ground. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s for you, Handel,\xe2\x80\x9d said Herbert, going out and coming\r\nback with it, \xe2\x80\x9cand I hope there is nothing the matter.\xe2\x80\x9d This was in\r\nallusion to its heavy black seal and border.\r\n\r\nThe letter was signed Trabb & Co., and its contents were simply, that\r\nI was an honored sir, and that they begged to inform me that Mrs. J.\r\nGargery had departed this life on Monday last at twenty minutes past six\r\nin the evening, and that my attendance was requested at the interment on\r\nMonday next at three o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the afternoon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXXV\r\n\r\nIt was the first time that a grave had opened in my road of life, and\r\nthe gap it made in the smooth ground was wonderful. The figure of my\r\nsister in her chair by the kitchen fire, haunted me night and day. That\r\nthe place could possibly be, without her, was something my mind seemed\r\nunable to compass; and whereas she had seldom or never been in my\r\nthoughts of late, I had now the strangest ideas that she was coming\r\ntowards me in the street, or that she would presently knock at the door.\r\nIn my rooms too, with which she had never been at all associated, there\r\nwas at once the blankness of death and a perpetual suggestion of the\r\nsound of her voice or the turn of her face or figure, as if she were\r\nstill alive and had been often there.\r\n\r\nWhatever my fortunes might have been, I could scarcely have recalled my\r\nsister with much tenderness. But I suppose there is a shock of regret\r\nwhich may exist without much tenderness. Under its influence (and\r\nperhaps to make up for the want of the softer feeling) I was seized with\r\na violent indignation against the assailant from whom she had suffered\r\nso much; and I felt that on sufficient proof I could have revengefully\r\npursued Orlick, or any one else, to the last extremity.\r\n\r\nHaving written to Joe, to offer him consolation, and to assure him\r\nthat I would come to the funeral, I passed the intermediate days in\r\nthe curious state of mind I have glanced at. I went down early in the\r\nmorning, and alighted at the Blue Boar in good time to walk over to the\r\nforge.\r\n\r\nIt was fine summer weather again, and, as I walked along, the times\r\nwhen I was a little helpless creature, and my sister did not spare me,\r\nvividly returned. But they returned with a gentle tone upon them that\r\nsoftened even the edge of Tickler. For now, the very breath of the beans\r\nand clover whispered to my heart that the day must come when it would\r\nbe well for my memory that others walking in the sunshine should be\r\nsoftened as they thought of me.\r\n\r\nAt last I came within sight of the house, and saw that Trabb and Co. had\r\nput in a funereal execution and taken possession. Two dismally absurd\r\npersons, each ostentatiously exhibiting a crutch done up in a black\r\nbandage,--as if that instrument could possibly communicate any comfort\r\nto anybody,--were posted at the front door; and in one of them I\r\nrecognized a postboy discharged from the Boar for turning a young couple\r\ninto a sawpit on their bridal morning, in consequence of intoxication\r\nrendering it necessary for him to ride his horse clasped round the neck\r\nwith both arms. All the children of the village, and most of the women,\r\nwere admiring these sable warders and the closed windows of the house\r\nand forge; and as I came up, one of the two warders (the postboy)\r\nknocked at the door,--implying that I was far too much exhausted by\r\ngrief to have strength remaining to knock for myself.\r\n\r\nAnother sable warder (a carpenter, who had once eaten two geese for a\r\nwager) opened the door, and showed me into the best parlor. Here, Mr.\r\nTrabb had taken unto himself the best table, and had got all the leaves\r\nup, and was holding a kind of black Bazaar, with the aid of a quantity\r\nof black pins. At the moment of my arrival, he had just finished putting\r\nsomebody\xe2\x80\x99s hat into black long-clothes, like an African baby; so he held\r\nout his hand for mine. But I, misled by the action, and confused by the\r\noccasion, shook hands with him with every testimony of warm affection.\r\n\r\nPoor dear Joe, entangled in a little black cloak tied in a large bow\r\nunder his chin, was seated apart at the upper end of the room; where,\r\nas chief mourner, he had evidently been stationed by Trabb. When I bent\r\ndown and said to him, \xe2\x80\x9cDear Joe, how are you?\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cPip, old chap,\r\nyou knowed her when she were a fine figure of a--\xe2\x80\x9d and clasped my hand\r\nand said no more.\r\n\r\nBiddy, looking very neat and modest in her black dress, went quietly\r\nhere and there, and was very helpful. When I had spoken to Biddy, as\r\nI thought it not a time for talking I went and sat down near Joe, and\r\nthere began to wonder in what part of the house it--she--my sister--was.\r\nThe air of the parlor being faint with the smell of sweet-cake, I looked\r\nabout for the table of refreshments; it was scarcely visible until one\r\nhad got accustomed to the gloom, but there was a cut-up plum cake upon\r\nit, and there were cut-up oranges, and sandwiches, and biscuits, and two\r\ndecanters that I knew very well as ornaments, but had never seen used\r\nin all my life; one full of port, and one of sherry. Standing at this\r\ntable, I became conscious of the servile Pumblechook in a black cloak\r\nand several yards of hatband, who was alternately stuffing himself,\r\nand making obsequious movements to catch my attention. The moment he\r\nsucceeded, he came over to me (breathing sherry and crumbs), and said\r\nin a subdued voice, \xe2\x80\x9cMay I, dear sir?\xe2\x80\x9d and did. I then descried Mr. and\r\nMrs. Hubble; the last-named in a decent speechless paroxysm in a corner.\r\nWe were all going to \xe2\x80\x9cfollow,\xe2\x80\x9d and were all in course of being tied up\r\nseparately (by Trabb) into ridiculous bundles.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhich I meantersay, Pip,\xe2\x80\x9d Joe whispered me, as we were being what Mr.\r\nTrabb called \xe2\x80\x9cformed\xe2\x80\x9d in the parlor, two and two,--and it was dreadfully\r\nlike a preparation for some grim kind of dance; \xe2\x80\x9cwhich I meantersay,\r\nsir, as I would in preference have carried her to the church myself,\r\nalong with three or four friendly ones wot come to it with willing harts\r\nand arms, but it were considered wot the neighbors would look down on\r\nsuch and would be of opinions as it were wanting in respect.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPocket-handkerchiefs out, all!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Mr. Trabb at this point, in a\r\ndepressed business-like voice. \xe2\x80\x9cPocket-handkerchiefs out! We are ready!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo we all put our pocket-handkerchiefs to our faces, as if our\r\nnoses were bleeding, and filed out two and two; Joe and I; Biddy and\r\nPumblechook; Mr. and Mrs. Hubble. The remains of my poor sister had been\r\nbrought round by the kitchen door, and, it being a point of Undertaking\r\nceremony that the six bearers must be stifled and blinded under a\r\nhorrible black velvet housing with a white border, the whole looked like\r\na blind monster with twelve human legs, shuffling and blundering along,\r\nunder the guidance of two keepers,--the postboy and his comrade.\r\n\r\nThe neighborhood, however, highly approved of these arrangements, and we\r\nwere much admired as we went through the village; the more youthful and\r\nvigorous part of the community making dashes now and then to cut us off,\r\nand lying in wait to intercept us at points of vantage. At such times\r\nthe more exuberant among them called out in an excited manner on our\r\nemergence round some corner of expectancy, \xe2\x80\x9cHere they come!\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cHere they\r\nare!\xe2\x80\x9d and we were all but cheered. In this progress I was much annoyed\r\nby the abject Pumblechook, who, being behind me, persisted all the way\r\nas a delicate attention in arranging my streaming hatband, and smoothing\r\nmy cloak. My thoughts were further distracted by the excessive pride of\r\nMr. and Mrs. Hubble, who were surpassingly conceited and vainglorious in\r\nbeing members of so distinguished a procession.\r\n\r\nAnd now the range of marshes lay clear before us, with the sails of the\r\nships on the river growing out of it; and we went into the churchyard,\r\nclose to the graves of my unknown parents, Philip Pirrip, late of this\r\nparish, and Also Georgiana, Wife of the Above. And there, my sister was\r\nlaid quietly in the earth, while the larks sang high above it, and the\r\nlight wind strewed it with beautiful shadows of clouds and trees.\r\n\r\nOf the conduct of the worldly minded Pumblechook while this was doing,\r\nI desire to say no more than it was all addressed to me; and that even\r\nwhen those noble passages were read which remind humanity how it brought\r\nnothing into the world and can take nothing out, and how it fleeth like\r\na shadow and never continueth long in one stay, I heard him cough a\r\nreservation of the case of a young gentleman who came unexpectedly into\r\nlarge property. When we got back, he had the hardihood to tell me that\r\nhe wished my sister could have known I had done her so much honor, and\r\nto hint that she would have considered it reasonably purchased at the\r\nprice of her death. After that, he drank all the rest of the sherry,\r\nand Mr. Hubble drank the port, and the two talked (which I have since\r\nobserved to be customary in such cases) as if they were of quite another\r\nrace from the deceased, and were notoriously immortal. Finally, he went\r\naway with Mr. and Mrs. Hubble,--to make an evening of it, I felt sure,\r\nand to tell the Jolly Bargemen that he was the founder of my fortunes\r\nand my earliest benefactor.\r\n\r\nWhen they were all gone, and when Trabb and his men--but not his Boy; I\r\nlooked for him--had crammed their mummery into bags, and were gone too,\r\nthe house felt wholesomer. Soon afterwards, Biddy, Joe, and I, had a\r\ncold dinner together; but we dined in the best parlor, not in the old\r\nkitchen, and Joe was so exceedingly particular what he did with his\r\nknife and fork and the saltcellar and what not, that there was great\r\nrestraint upon us. But after dinner, when I made him take his pipe,\r\nand when I had loitered with him about the forge, and when we sat down\r\ntogether on the great block of stone outside it, we got on better. I\r\nnoticed that after the funeral Joe changed his clothes so far, as to\r\nmake a compromise between his Sunday dress and working dress; in which\r\nthe dear fellow looked natural, and like the Man he was.\r\n\r\nHe was very much pleased by my asking if I might sleep in my own little\r\nroom, and I was pleased too; for I felt that I had done rather a great\r\nthing in making the request. When the shadows of evening were closing\r\nin, I took an opportunity of getting into the garden with Biddy for a\r\nlittle talk.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBiddy,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cI think you might have written to me about these sad\r\nmatters.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you, Mr. Pip?\xe2\x80\x9d said Biddy. \xe2\x80\x9cI should have written if I had thought\r\nthat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t suppose that I mean to be unkind, Biddy, when I say I consider\r\nthat you ought to have thought that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you, Mr. Pip?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was so quiet, and had such an orderly, good, and pretty way with\r\nher, that I did not like the thought of making her cry again. After\r\nlooking a little at her downcast eyes as she walked beside me, I gave up\r\nthat point.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose it will be difficult for you to remain here now, Biddy dear?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! I can\xe2\x80\x99t do so, Mr. Pip,\xe2\x80\x9d said Biddy, in a tone of regret but still\r\nof quiet conviction. \xe2\x80\x9cI have been speaking to Mrs. Hubble, and I am\r\ngoing to her to-morrow. I hope we shall be able to take some care of Mr.\r\nGargery, together, until he settles down.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow are you going to live, Biddy? If you want any mo--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow am I going to live?\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Biddy, striking in, with a momentary\r\nflush upon her face. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you, Mr. Pip. I am going to try to get\r\nthe place of mistress in the new school nearly finished here. I can be\r\nwell recommended by all the neighbors, and I hope I can be industrious\r\nand patient, and teach myself while I teach others. You know, Mr. Pip,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n pursued Biddy, with a smile, as she raised her eyes to my face, \xe2\x80\x9cthe new\r\nschools are not like the old, but I learnt a good deal from you after\r\nthat time, and have had time since then to improve.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think you would always improve, Biddy, under any circumstances.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! Except in my bad side of human nature,\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Biddy.\r\n\r\nIt was not so much a reproach as an irresistible thinking aloud. Well!\r\nI thought I would give up that point too. So, I walked a little further\r\nwith Biddy, looking silently at her downcast eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have not heard the particulars of my sister\xe2\x80\x99s death, Biddy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are very slight, poor thing. She had been in one of her bad\r\nstates--though they had got better of late, rather than worse--for four\r\ndays, when she came out of it in the evening, just at tea-time, and said\r\nquite plainly, \xe2\x80\x98Joe.\xe2\x80\x99 As she had never said any word for a long while, I\r\nran and fetched in Mr. Gargery from the forge. She made signs to me that\r\nshe wanted him to sit down close to her, and wanted me to put her arms\r\nround his neck. So I put them round his neck, and she laid her head down\r\non his shoulder quite content and satisfied. And so she presently said\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Joe\xe2\x80\x99 again, and once \xe2\x80\x98Pardon,\xe2\x80\x99 and once \xe2\x80\x98Pip.\xe2\x80\x99 And so she never lifted\r\nher head up any more, and it was just an hour later when we laid it down\r\non her own bed, because we found she was gone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBiddy cried; the darkening garden, and the lane, and the stars that were\r\ncoming out, were blurred in my own sight.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing was ever discovered, Biddy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know what is become of Orlick?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should think from the color of his clothes that he is working in the\r\nquarries.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course you have seen him then?--Why are you looking at that dark\r\ntree in the lane?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI saw him there, on the night she died.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat was not the last time either, Biddy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; I have seen him there, since we have been walking here.--It is of\r\nno use,\xe2\x80\x9d said Biddy, laying her hand upon my arm, as I was for running\r\nout, \xe2\x80\x9cyou know I would not deceive you; he was not there a minute, and\r\nhe is gone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt revived my utmost indignation to find that she was still pursued by\r\nthis fellow, and I felt inveterate against him. I told her so, and told\r\nher that I would spend any money or take any pains to drive him out of\r\nthat country. By degrees she led me into more temperate talk, and she\r\ntold me how Joe loved me, and how Joe never complained of anything,--she\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t say, of me; she had no need; I knew what she meant,--but ever did\r\nhis duty in his way of life, with a strong hand, a quiet tongue, and a\r\ngentle heart.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed, it would be hard to say too much for him,\xe2\x80\x9d said I; \xe2\x80\x9cand Biddy,\r\nwe must often speak of these things, for of course I shall be often down\r\nhere now. I am not going to leave poor Joe alone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBiddy said never a single word.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBiddy, don\xe2\x80\x99t you hear me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Mr. Pip.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot to mention your calling me Mr. Pip,--which appears to me to be in\r\nbad taste, Biddy,--what do you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do I mean?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Biddy, timidly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBiddy,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, in a virtuously self-asserting manner, \xe2\x80\x9cI must request\r\nto know what you mean by this?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy this?\xe2\x80\x9d said Biddy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, don\xe2\x80\x99t echo,\xe2\x80\x9d I retorted. \xe2\x80\x9cYou used not to echo, Biddy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUsed not!\xe2\x80\x9d said Biddy. \xe2\x80\x9cO Mr. Pip! Used!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWell! I rather thought I would give up that point too. After another\r\nsilent turn in the garden, I fell back on the main position.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBiddy,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cI made a remark respecting my coming down here often,\r\nto see Joe, which you received with a marked silence. Have the goodness,\r\nBiddy, to tell me why.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you quite sure, then, that you WILL come to see him often?\xe2\x80\x9d asked\r\nBiddy, stopping in the narrow garden walk, and looking at me under the\r\nstars with a clear and honest eye.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO dear me!\xe2\x80\x9d said I, as if I found myself compelled to give up Biddy in\r\ndespair. \xe2\x80\x9cThis really is a very bad side of human nature! Don\xe2\x80\x99t say any\r\nmore, if you please, Biddy. This shocks me very much.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor which cogent reason I kept Biddy at a distance during supper, and\r\nwhen I went up to my own old little room, took as stately a leave of her\r\nas I could, in my murmuring soul, deem reconcilable with the churchyard\r\nand the event of the day. As often as I was restless in the night, and\r\nthat was every quarter of an hour, I reflected what an unkindness, what\r\nan injury, what an injustice, Biddy had done me.\r\n\r\nEarly in the morning I was to go. Early in the morning I was out, and\r\nlooking in, unseen, at one of the wooden windows of the forge. There\r\nI stood, for minutes, looking at Joe, already at work with a glow of\r\nhealth and strength upon his face that made it show as if the bright sun\r\nof the life in store for him were shining on it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood-bye, dear Joe!--No, don\xe2\x80\x99t wipe it off--for God\xe2\x80\x99s sake, give me your\r\nblackened hand!--I shall be down soon and often.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever too soon, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe, \xe2\x80\x9cand never too often, Pip!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBiddy was waiting for me at the kitchen door, with a mug of new milk and\r\na crust of bread. \xe2\x80\x9cBiddy,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, when I gave her my hand at parting,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not angry, but I am hurt.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, don\xe2\x80\x99t be hurt,\xe2\x80\x9d she pleaded quite pathetically; \xe2\x80\x9clet only me be\r\nhurt, if I have been ungenerous.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOnce more, the mists were rising as I walked away. If they disclosed to\r\nme, as I suspect they did, that I should not come back, and that Biddy\r\nwas quite right, all I can say is,--they were quite right too.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXXVI\r\n\r\nHerbert and I went on from bad to worse, in the way of increasing our\r\ndebts, looking into our affairs, leaving Margins, and the like exemplary\r\ntransactions; and Time went on, whether or no, as he has a way of doing;\r\nand I came of age,--in fulfilment of Herbert\xe2\x80\x99s prediction, that I should\r\ndo so before I knew where I was.\r\n\r\nHerbert himself had come of age eight months before me. As he had\r\nnothing else than his majority to come into, the event did not make a\r\nprofound sensation in Barnard\xe2\x80\x99s Inn. But we had looked forward to\r\nmy one-and-twentieth birthday, with a crowd of speculations and\r\nanticipations, for we had both considered that my guardian could hardly\r\nhelp saying something definite on that occasion.\r\n\r\nI had taken care to have it well understood in Little Britain when my\r\nbirthday was. On the day before it, I received an official note from\r\nWemmick, informing me that Mr. Jaggers would be glad if I would call\r\nupon him at five in the afternoon of the auspicious day. This convinced\r\nus that something great was to happen, and threw me into an unusual\r\nflutter when I repaired to my guardian\xe2\x80\x99s office, a model of punctuality.\r\n\r\nIn the outer office Wemmick offered me his congratulations, and\r\nincidentally rubbed the side of his nose with a folded piece of\r\ntissue-paper that I liked the look of. But he said nothing respecting\r\nit, and motioned me with a nod into my guardian\xe2\x80\x99s room. It was November,\r\nand my guardian was standing before his fire leaning his back against\r\nthe chimney-piece, with his hands under his coattails.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Pip,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cI must call you Mr. Pip to-day. Congratulations,\r\nMr. Pip.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe shook hands,--he was always a remarkably short shaker,--and I thanked\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTake a chair, Mr. Pip,\xe2\x80\x9d said my guardian.\r\n\r\nAs I sat down, and he preserved his attitude and bent his brows at his\r\nboots, I felt at a disadvantage, which reminded me of that old time when\r\nI had been put upon a tombstone. The two ghastly casts on the shelf\r\nwere not far from him, and their expression was as if they were making a\r\nstupid apoplectic attempt to attend to the conversation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow my young friend,\xe2\x80\x9d my guardian began, as if I were a witness in the\r\nbox, \xe2\x80\x9cI am going to have a word or two with you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you please, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you suppose,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Jaggers, bending forward to look at the\r\nground, and then throwing his head back to look at the ceiling,--\xe2\x80\x9cwhat\r\ndo you suppose you are living at the rate of?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt the rate of, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt,\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Mr. Jaggers, still looking at the ceiling,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthe--rate--of?\xe2\x80\x9d And then looked all round the room, and paused with his\r\npocket-handkerchief in his hand, half-way to his nose.\r\n\r\nI had looked into my affairs so often, that I had thoroughly destroyed\r\nany slight notion I might ever have had of their bearings. Reluctantly,\r\nI confessed myself quite unable to answer the question. This reply\r\nseemed agreeable to Mr. Jaggers, who said, \xe2\x80\x9cI thought so!\xe2\x80\x9d and blew his\r\nnose with an air of satisfaction.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, I have asked you a question, my friend,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Jaggers. \xe2\x80\x9cHave\r\nyou anything to ask me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course it would be a great relief to me to ask you several\r\nquestions, sir; but I remember your prohibition.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAsk one,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Jaggers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs my benefactor to be made known to me to-day?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo. Ask another.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs that confidence to be imparted to me soon?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWaive that, a moment,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Jaggers, \xe2\x80\x9cand ask another.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI looked about me, but there appeared to be now no possible escape from\r\nthe inquiry, \xe2\x80\x9cHave-I--anything to receive, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d On that, Mr. Jaggers\r\nsaid, triumphantly, \xe2\x80\x9cI thought we should come to it!\xe2\x80\x9d and called to\r\nWemmick to give him that piece of paper. Wemmick appeared, handed it in,\r\nand disappeared.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, Mr. Pip,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Jaggers, \xe2\x80\x9cattend, if you please. You have been\r\ndrawing pretty freely here; your name occurs pretty often in Wemmick\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncash-book; but you are in debt, of course?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am afraid I must say yes, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know you must say yes; don\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Jaggers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t ask you what you owe, because you don\xe2\x80\x99t know; and if you did\r\nknow, you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t tell me; you would say less. Yes, yes, my friend,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n cried Mr. Jaggers, waving his forefinger to stop me as I made a show\r\nof protesting: \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s likely enough that you think you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t, but\r\nyou would. You\xe2\x80\x99ll excuse me, but I know better than you. Now, take this\r\npiece of paper in your hand. You have got it? Very good. Now, unfold it\r\nand tell me what it is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is a bank-note,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cfor five hundred pounds.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is a bank-note,\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Mr. Jaggers, \xe2\x80\x9cfor five hundred pounds.\r\nAnd a very handsome sum of money too, I think. You consider it so?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow could I do otherwise!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh! But answer the question,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Jaggers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUndoubtedly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou consider it, undoubtedly, a handsome sum of money. Now, that\r\nhandsome sum of money, Pip, is your own. It is a present to you on this\r\nday, in earnest of your expectations. And at the rate of that handsome\r\nsum of money per annum, and at no higher rate, you are to live until the\r\ndonor of the whole appears. That is to say, you will now take your money\r\naffairs entirely into your own hands, and you will draw from Wemmick\r\none hundred and twenty-five pounds per quarter, until you are in\r\ncommunication with the fountain-head, and no longer with the mere\r\nagent. As I have told you before, I am the mere agent. I execute my\r\ninstructions, and I am paid for doing so. I think them injudicious, but\r\nI am not paid for giving any opinion on their merits.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI was beginning to express my gratitude to my benefactor for the great\r\nliberality with which I was treated, when Mr. Jaggers stopped me. \xe2\x80\x9cI am\r\nnot paid, Pip,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, coolly, \xe2\x80\x9cto carry your words to any one;\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\nthen gathered up his coat-tails, as he had gathered up the subject, and\r\nstood frowning at his boots as if he suspected them of designs against\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nAfter a pause, I hinted,--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere was a question just now, Mr. Jaggers, which you desired me to\r\nwaive for a moment. I hope I am doing nothing wrong in asking it again?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it?\xe2\x80\x9d said he.\r\n\r\nI might have known that he would never help me out; but it took me aback\r\nto have to shape the question afresh, as if it were quite new. \xe2\x80\x9cIs it\r\nlikely,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, after hesitating, \xe2\x80\x9cthat my patron, the fountain-head\r\nyou have spoken of, Mr. Jaggers, will soon--\xe2\x80\x9d there I delicately\r\nstopped.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill soon what?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mr. Jaggers. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s no question as it stands,\r\nyou know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill soon come to London,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, after casting about for a precise\r\nform of words, \xe2\x80\x9cor summon me anywhere else?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, here,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Mr. Jaggers, fixing me for the first time with\r\nhis dark deep-set eyes, \xe2\x80\x9cwe must revert to the evening when we first\r\nencountered one another in your village. What did I tell you then, Pip?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou told me, Mr. Jaggers, that it might be years hence when that person\r\nappeared.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cJust so,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Jaggers, \xe2\x80\x9cthat\xe2\x80\x99s my answer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs we looked full at one another, I felt my breath come quicker in my\r\nstrong desire to get something out of him. And as I felt that it came\r\nquicker, and as I felt that he saw that it came quicker, I felt that I\r\nhad less chance than ever of getting anything out of him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you suppose it will still be years hence, Mr. Jaggers?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Jaggers shook his head,--not in negativing the question, but in\r\naltogether negativing the notion that he could anyhow be got to answer\r\nit,--and the two horrible casts of the twitched faces looked, when\r\nmy eyes strayed up to them, as if they had come to a crisis in their\r\nsuspended attention, and were going to sneeze.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Jaggers, warming the backs of his legs with the backs\r\nof his warmed hands, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll be plain with you, my friend Pip. That\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nquestion I must not be asked. You\xe2\x80\x99ll understand that better, when I tell\r\nyou it\xe2\x80\x99s a question that might compromise me. Come! I\xe2\x80\x99ll go a little\r\nfurther with you; I\xe2\x80\x99ll say something more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe bent down so low to frown at his boots, that he was able to rub the\r\ncalves of his legs in the pause he made.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen that person discloses,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Jaggers, straightening himself,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cyou and that person will settle your own affairs. When that person\r\ndiscloses, my part in this business will cease and determine. When that\r\nperson discloses, it will not be necessary for me to know anything about\r\nit. And that\xe2\x80\x99s all I have got to say.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe looked at one another until I withdrew my eyes, and looked\r\nthoughtfully at the floor. From this last speech I derived the notion\r\nthat Miss Havisham, for some reason or no reason, had not taken him\r\ninto her confidence as to her designing me for Estella; that he resented\r\nthis, and felt a jealousy about it; or that he really did object to\r\nthat scheme, and would have nothing to do with it. When I raised my eyes\r\nagain, I found that he had been shrewdly looking at me all the time, and\r\nwas doing so still.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf that is all you have to say, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d I remarked, \xe2\x80\x9cthere can be nothing\r\nleft for me to say.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe nodded assent, and pulled out his thief-dreaded watch, and asked me\r\nwhere I was going to dine? I replied at my own chambers, with Herbert.\r\nAs a necessary sequence, I asked him if he would favor us with his\r\ncompany, and he promptly accepted the invitation. But he insisted on\r\nwalking home with me, in order that I might make no extra preparation\r\nfor him, and first he had a letter or two to write, and (of course) had\r\nhis hands to wash. So I said I would go into the outer office and talk\r\nto Wemmick.\r\n\r\nThe fact was, that when the five hundred pounds had come into my pocket,\r\na thought had come into my head which had been often there before;\r\nand it appeared to me that Wemmick was a good person to advise with\r\nconcerning such thought.\r\n\r\nHe had already locked up his safe, and made preparations for going home.\r\nHe had left his desk, brought out his two greasy office candlesticks and\r\nstood them in line with the snuffers on a slab near the door, ready to\r\nbe extinguished; he had raked his fire low, put his hat and great-coat\r\nready, and was beating himself all over the chest with his safe-key, as\r\nan athletic exercise after business.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Wemmick,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cI want to ask your opinion. I am very desirous\r\nto serve a friend.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWemmick tightened his post-office and shook his head, as if his opinion\r\nwere dead against any fatal weakness of that sort.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis friend,\xe2\x80\x9d I pursued, \xe2\x80\x9cis trying to get on in commercial life,\r\nbut has no money, and finds it difficult and disheartening to make a\r\nbeginning. Now I want somehow to help him to a beginning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith money down?\xe2\x80\x9d said Wemmick, in a tone drier than any sawdust.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith some money down,\xe2\x80\x9d I replied, for an uneasy remembrance shot across\r\nme of that symmetrical bundle of papers at home--\xe2\x80\x9cwith some money down,\r\nand perhaps some anticipation of my expectations.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Pip,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wemmick, \xe2\x80\x9cI should like just to run over with you on my\r\nfingers, if you please, the names of the various bridges up as high\r\nas Chelsea Reach. Let\xe2\x80\x99s see; there\xe2\x80\x99s London, one; Southwark, two;\r\nBlackfriars, three; Waterloo, four; Westminster, five; Vauxhall, six.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n He had checked off each bridge in its turn, with the handle of his\r\nsafe-key on the palm of his hand. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s as many as six, you see, to\r\nchoose from.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t understand you,\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cChoose your bridge, Mr. Pip,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Wemmick, \xe2\x80\x9cand take a walk upon\r\nyour bridge, and pitch your money into the Thames over the centre arch\r\nof your bridge, and you know the end of it. Serve a friend with it, and\r\nyou may know the end of it too,--but it\xe2\x80\x99s a less pleasant and profitable\r\nend.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI could have posted a newspaper in his mouth, he made it so wide after\r\nsaying this.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is very discouraging,\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMeant to be so,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wemmick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen is it your opinion,\xe2\x80\x9d I inquired, with some little indignation,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthat a man should never--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c--Invest portable property in a friend?\xe2\x80\x9d said Wemmick. \xe2\x80\x9cCertainly\r\nhe should not. Unless he wants to get rid of the friend,--and then it\r\nbecomes a question how much portable property it may be worth to get rid\r\nof him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd that,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cis your deliberate opinion, Mr. Wemmick?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat,\xe2\x80\x9d he returned, \xe2\x80\x9cis my deliberate opinion in this office.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d said I, pressing him, for I thought I saw him near a loophole\r\nhere; \xe2\x80\x9cbut would that be your opinion at Walworth?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Pip,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied, with gravity, \xe2\x80\x9cWalworth is one place, and this\r\noffice is another. Much as the Aged is one person, and Mr. Jaggers is\r\nanother. They must not be confounded together. My Walworth sentiments\r\nmust be taken at Walworth; none but my official sentiments can be taken\r\nin this office.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery well,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, much relieved, \xe2\x80\x9cthen I shall look you up at\r\nWalworth, you may depend upon it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Pip,\xe2\x80\x9d he returned, \xe2\x80\x9cyou will be welcome there, in a private and\r\npersonal capacity.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe had held this conversation in a low voice, well knowing my guardian\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nears to be the sharpest of the sharp. As he now appeared in his doorway,\r\ntowelling his hands, Wemmick got on his great-coat and stood by to snuff\r\nout the candles. We all three went into the street together, and from\r\nthe door-step Wemmick turned his way, and Mr. Jaggers and I turned ours.\r\n\r\nI could not help wishing more than once that evening, that Mr. Jaggers\r\nhad had an Aged in Gerrard Street, or a Stinger, or a Something, or\r\na Somebody, to unbend his brows a little. It was an uncomfortable\r\nconsideration on a twenty-first birthday, that coming of age at all\r\nseemed hardly worth while in such a guarded and suspicious world as he\r\nmade of it. He was a thousand times better informed and cleverer than\r\nWemmick, and yet I would a thousand times rather have had Wemmick to\r\ndinner. And Mr. Jaggers made not me alone intensely melancholy, because,\r\nafter he was gone, Herbert said of himself, with his eyes fixed on the\r\nfire, that he thought he must have committed a felony and forgotten the\r\ndetails of it, he felt so dejected and guilty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXXVII\r\n\r\nDeeming Sunday the best day for taking Mr. Wemmick\xe2\x80\x99s Walworth\r\nsentiments, I devoted the next ensuing Sunday afternoon to a pilgrimage\r\nto the Castle. On arriving before the battlements, I found the Union\r\nJack flying and the drawbridge up; but undeterred by this show of\r\ndefiance and resistance, I rang at the gate, and was admitted in a most\r\npacific manner by the Aged.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy son, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old man, after securing the drawbridge, \xe2\x80\x9crather\r\nhad it in his mind that you might happen to drop in, and he left word\r\nthat he would soon be home from his afternoon\xe2\x80\x99s walk. He is very regular\r\nin his walks, is my son. Very regular in everything, is my son.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI nodded at the old gentleman as Wemmick himself might have nodded, and\r\nwe went in and sat down by the fireside.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou made acquaintance with my son, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old man, in his\r\nchirping way, while he warmed his hands at the blaze, \xe2\x80\x9cat his office, I\r\nexpect?\xe2\x80\x9d I nodded. \xe2\x80\x9cHah! I have heerd that my son is a wonderful hand at\r\nhis business, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d I nodded hard. \xe2\x80\x9cYes; so they tell me. His business\r\nis the Law?\xe2\x80\x9d I nodded harder. \xe2\x80\x9cWhich makes it more surprising in my\r\nson,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old man, \xe2\x80\x9cfor he was not brought up to the Law, but to\r\nthe Wine-Coopering.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nCurious to know how the old gentleman stood informed concerning the\r\nreputation of Mr. Jaggers, I roared that name at him. He threw me into\r\nthe greatest confusion by laughing heartily and replying in a very\r\nsprightly manner, \xe2\x80\x9cNo, to be sure; you\xe2\x80\x99re right.\xe2\x80\x9d And to this hour I\r\nhave not the faintest notion what he meant, or what joke he thought I\r\nhad made.\r\n\r\nAs I could not sit there nodding at him perpetually, without making\r\nsome other attempt to interest him, I shouted at inquiry whether his own\r\ncalling in life had been \xe2\x80\x9cthe Wine-Coopering.\xe2\x80\x9d By dint of straining that\r\nterm out of myself several times and tapping the old gentleman on the\r\nchest to associate it with him, I at last succeeded in making my meaning\r\nunderstood.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said the old gentleman; \xe2\x80\x9cthe warehousing, the warehousing. First,\r\nover yonder;\xe2\x80\x9d he appeared to mean up the chimney, but I believe he\r\nintended to refer me to Liverpool; \xe2\x80\x9cand then in the City of London here.\r\nHowever, having an infirmity--for I am hard of hearing, sir--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI expressed in pantomime the greatest astonishment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c--Yes, hard of hearing; having that infirmity coming upon me, my son he\r\nwent into the Law, and he took charge of me, and he by little and little\r\nmade out this elegant and beautiful property. But returning to what you\r\nsaid, you know,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued the old man, again laughing heartily, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat I\r\nsay is, No to be sure; you\xe2\x80\x99re right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI was modestly wondering whether my utmost ingenuity would have enabled\r\nme to say anything that would have amused him half as much as this\r\nimaginary pleasantry, when I was startled by a sudden click in the wall\r\non one side of the chimney, and the ghostly tumbling open of a little\r\nwooden flap with \xe2\x80\x9cJOHN\xe2\x80\x9d upon it. The old man, following my eyes, cried\r\nwith great triumph, \xe2\x80\x9cMy son\xe2\x80\x99s come home!\xe2\x80\x9d and we both went out to the\r\ndrawbridge.\r\n\r\nIt was worth any money to see Wemmick waving a salute to me from the\r\nother side of the moat, when we might have shaken hands across it with\r\nthe greatest ease. The Aged was so delighted to work the drawbridge,\r\nthat I made no offer to assist him, but stood quiet until Wemmick had\r\ncome across, and had presented me to Miss Skiffins; a lady by whom he\r\nwas accompanied.\r\n\r\nMiss Skiffins was of a wooden appearance, and was, like her escort, in\r\nthe post-office branch of the service. She might have been some two or\r\nthree years younger than Wemmick, and I judged her to stand possessed\r\nof portable property. The cut of her dress from the waist upward, both\r\nbefore and behind, made her figure very like a boy\xe2\x80\x99s kite; and I might\r\nhave pronounced her gown a little too decidedly orange, and her gloves a\r\nlittle too intensely green. But she seemed to be a good sort of fellow,\r\nand showed a high regard for the Aged. I was not long in discovering\r\nthat she was a frequent visitor at the Castle; for, on our going in,\r\nand my complimenting Wemmick on his ingenious contrivance for announcing\r\nhimself to the Aged, he begged me to give my attention for a moment to\r\nthe other side of the chimney, and disappeared. Presently another click\r\ncame, and another little door tumbled open with \xe2\x80\x9cMiss Skiffins\xe2\x80\x9d on it;\r\nthen Miss Skiffins shut up and John tumbled open; then Miss Skiffins\r\nand John both tumbled open together, and finally shut up together. On\r\nWemmick\xe2\x80\x99s return from working these mechanical appliances, I expressed\r\nthe great admiration with which I regarded them, and he said, \xe2\x80\x9cWell, you\r\nknow, they\xe2\x80\x99re both pleasant and useful to the Aged. And by George, sir,\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s a thing worth mentioning, that of all the people who come to\r\nthis gate, the secret of those pulls is only known to the Aged, Miss\r\nSkiffins, and me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd Mr. Wemmick made them,\xe2\x80\x9d added Miss Skiffins, \xe2\x80\x9cwith his own hands\r\nout of his own head.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhile Miss Skiffins was taking off her bonnet (she retained her green\r\ngloves during the evening as an outward and visible sign that there was\r\ncompany), Wemmick invited me to take a walk with him round the property,\r\nand see how the island looked in wintertime. Thinking that he did this\r\nto give me an opportunity of taking his Walworth sentiments, I seized\r\nthe opportunity as soon as we were out of the Castle.\r\n\r\nHaving thought of the matter with care, I approached my subject as if I\r\nhad never hinted at it before. I informed Wemmick that I was anxious in\r\nbehalf of Herbert Pocket, and I told him how we had first met, and how\r\nwe had fought. I glanced at Herbert\xe2\x80\x99s home, and at his character, and\r\nat his having no means but such as he was dependent on his father for;\r\nthose, uncertain and unpunctual. I alluded to the advantages I had\r\nderived in my first rawness and ignorance from his society, and I\r\nconfessed that I feared I had but ill repaid them, and that he might\r\nhave done better without me and my expectations. Keeping Miss Havisham\r\nin the background at a great distance, I still hinted at the possibility\r\nof my having competed with him in his prospects, and at the certainty of\r\nhis possessing a generous soul, and being far above any mean distrusts,\r\nretaliations, or designs. For all these reasons (I told Wemmick),\r\nand because he was my young companion and friend, and I had a great\r\naffection for him, I wished my own good fortune to reflect some rays\r\nupon him, and therefore I sought advice from Wemmick\xe2\x80\x99s experience and\r\nknowledge of men and affairs, how I could best try with my resources to\r\nhelp Herbert to some present income,--say of a hundred a year, to keep\r\nhim in good hope and heart,--and gradually to buy him on to some small\r\npartnership. I begged Wemmick, in conclusion, to understand that my help\r\nmust always be rendered without Herbert\xe2\x80\x99s knowledge or suspicion, and\r\nthat there was no one else in the world with whom I could advise. I\r\nwound up by laying my hand upon his shoulder, and saying, \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t help\r\nconfiding in you, though I know it must be troublesome to you; but that\r\nis your fault, in having ever brought me here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWemmick was silent for a little while, and then said with a kind of\r\nstart, \xe2\x80\x9cWell you know, Mr. Pip, I must tell you one thing. This is\r\ndevilish good of you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSay you\xe2\x80\x99ll help me to be good then,\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEcod,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Wemmick, shaking his head, \xe2\x80\x9cthat\xe2\x80\x99s not my trade.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNor is this your trading-place,\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are right,\xe2\x80\x9d he returned. \xe2\x80\x9cYou hit the nail on the head. Mr. Pip,\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll put on my considering-cap, and I think all you want to do may be\r\ndone by degrees. Skiffins (that\xe2\x80\x99s her brother) is an accountant and\r\nagent. I\xe2\x80\x99ll look him up and go to work for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thank you ten thousand times.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn the contrary,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cI thank you, for though we are strictly in\r\nour private and personal capacity, still it may be mentioned that there\r\nare Newgate cobwebs about, and it brushes them away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter a little further conversation to the same effect, we returned into\r\nthe Castle where we found Miss Skiffins preparing tea. The responsible\r\nduty of making the toast was delegated to the Aged, and that excellent\r\nold gentleman was so intent upon it that he seemed to me in some danger\r\nof melting his eyes. It was no nominal meal that we were going to make,\r\nbut a vigorous reality. The Aged prepared such a hay-stack of buttered\r\ntoast, that I could scarcely see him over it as it simmered on an iron\r\nstand hooked on to the top-bar; while Miss Skiffins brewed such a jorum\r\nof tea, that the pig in the back premises became strongly excited, and\r\nrepeatedly expressed his desire to participate in the entertainment.\r\n\r\nThe flag had been struck, and the gun had been fired, at the right\r\nmoment of time, and I felt as snugly cut off from the rest of Walworth\r\nas if the moat were thirty feet wide by as many deep. Nothing disturbed\r\nthe tranquillity of the Castle, but the occasional tumbling open of\r\nJohn and Miss Skiffins: which little doors were a prey to some spasmodic\r\ninfirmity that made me sympathetically uncomfortable until I got used\r\nto it. I inferred from the methodical nature of Miss Skiffins\xe2\x80\x99s\r\narrangements that she made tea there every Sunday night; and I rather\r\nsuspected that a classic brooch she wore, representing the profile of an\r\nundesirable female with a very straight nose and a very new moon, was a\r\npiece of portable property that had been given her by Wemmick.\r\n\r\nWe ate the whole of the toast, and drank tea in proportion, and it was\r\ndelightful to see how warm and greasy we all got after it. The Aged\r\nespecially, might have passed for some clean old chief of a savage\r\ntribe, just oiled. After a short pause of repose, Miss Skiffins--in the\r\nabsence of the little servant who, it seemed, retired to the bosom of\r\nher family on Sunday afternoons--washed up the tea-things, in a trifling\r\nlady-like amateur manner that compromised none of us. Then, she put on\r\nher gloves again, and we drew round the fire, and Wemmick said, \xe2\x80\x9cNow,\r\nAged Parent, tip us the paper.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWemmick explained to me while the Aged got his spectacles out, that this\r\nwas according to custom, and that it gave the old gentleman infinite\r\nsatisfaction to read the news aloud. \xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t offer an apology,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nWemmick, \xe2\x80\x9cfor he isn\xe2\x80\x99t capable of many pleasures--are you, Aged P.?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right, John, all right,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the old man, seeing himself\r\nspoken to.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly tip him a nod every now and then when he looks off his paper,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n said Wemmick, \xe2\x80\x9cand he\xe2\x80\x99ll be as happy as a king. We are all attention,\r\nAged One.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right, John, all right!\xe2\x80\x9d returned the cheerful old man, so busy and\r\nso pleased, that it really was quite charming.\r\n\r\nThe Aged\xe2\x80\x99s reading reminded me of the classes at Mr. Wopsle\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngreat-aunt\xe2\x80\x99s, with the pleasanter peculiarity that it seemed to come\r\nthrough a keyhole. As he wanted the candles close to him, and as he was\r\nalways on the verge of putting either his head or the newspaper into\r\nthem, he required as much watching as a powder-mill. But Wemmick was\r\nequally untiring and gentle in his vigilance, and the Aged read on,\r\nquite unconscious of his many rescues. Whenever he looked at us, we\r\nall expressed the greatest interest and amazement, and nodded until he\r\nresumed again.\r\n\r\nAs Wemmick and Miss Skiffins sat side by side, and as I sat in a shadowy\r\ncorner, I observed a slow and gradual elongation of Mr. Wemmick\xe2\x80\x99s mouth,\r\npowerfully suggestive of his slowly and gradually stealing his arm round\r\nMiss Skiffins\xe2\x80\x99s waist. In course of time I saw his hand appear on the\r\nother side of Miss Skiffins; but at that moment Miss Skiffins neatly\r\nstopped him with the green glove, unwound his arm again as if it were\r\nan article of dress, and with the greatest deliberation laid it on the\r\ntable before her. Miss Skiffins\xe2\x80\x99s composure while she did this was one\r\nof the most remarkable sights I have ever seen, and if I could have\r\nthought the act consistent with abstraction of mind, I should have\r\ndeemed that Miss Skiffins performed it mechanically.\r\n\r\nBy and by, I noticed Wemmick\xe2\x80\x99s arm beginning to disappear again, and\r\ngradually fading out of view. Shortly afterwards, his mouth began to\r\nwiden again. After an interval of suspense on my part that was quite\r\nenthralling and almost painful, I saw his hand appear on the other side\r\nof Miss Skiffins. Instantly, Miss Skiffins stopped it with the neatness\r\nof a placid boxer, took off that girdle or cestus as before, and laid\r\nit on the table. Taking the table to represent the path of virtue, I am\r\njustified in stating that during the whole time of the Aged\xe2\x80\x99s reading,\r\nWemmick\xe2\x80\x99s arm was straying from the path of virtue and being recalled to\r\nit by Miss Skiffins.\r\n\r\nAt last, the Aged read himself into a light slumber. This was the time\r\nfor Wemmick to produce a little kettle, a tray of glasses, and a\r\nblack bottle with a porcelain-topped cork, representing some clerical\r\ndignitary of a rubicund and social aspect. With the aid of these\r\nappliances we all had something warm to drink, including the Aged, who\r\nwas soon awake again. Miss Skiffins mixed, and I observed that she and\r\nWemmick drank out of one glass. Of course I knew better than to offer to\r\nsee Miss Skiffins home, and under the circumstances I thought I had best\r\ngo first; which I did, taking a cordial leave of the Aged, and having\r\npassed a pleasant evening.\r\n\r\nBefore a week was out, I received a note from Wemmick, dated Walworth,\r\nstating that he hoped he had made some advance in that matter\r\nappertaining to our private and personal capacities, and that he would\r\nbe glad if I could come and see him again upon it. So, I went out\r\nto Walworth again, and yet again, and yet again, and I saw him by\r\nappointment in the City several times, but never held any communication\r\nwith him on the subject in or near Little Britain. The upshot was,\r\nthat we found a worthy young merchant or shipping-broker, not long\r\nestablished in business, who wanted intelligent help, and who wanted\r\ncapital, and who in due course of time and receipt would want a partner.\r\nBetween him and me, secret articles were signed of which Herbert was the\r\nsubject, and I paid him half of my five hundred pounds down, and engaged\r\nfor sundry other payments: some, to fall due at certain dates out of my\r\nincome: some, contingent on my coming into my property. Miss Skiffins\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbrother conducted the negotiation. Wemmick pervaded it throughout, but\r\nnever appeared in it.\r\n\r\nThe whole business was so cleverly managed, that Herbert had not the\r\nleast suspicion of my hand being in it. I never shall forget the radiant\r\nface with which he came home one afternoon, and told me, as a mighty\r\npiece of news, of his having fallen in with one Clarriker (the young\r\nmerchant\xe2\x80\x99s name), and of Clarriker\xe2\x80\x99s having shown an extraordinary\r\ninclination towards him, and of his belief that the opening had come at\r\nlast. Day by day as his hopes grew stronger and his face brighter, he\r\nmust have thought me a more and more affectionate friend, for I had the\r\ngreatest difficulty in restraining my tears of triumph when I saw him so\r\nhappy. At length, the thing being done, and he having that day entered\r\nClarriker\xe2\x80\x99s House, and he having talked to me for a whole evening in a\r\nflush of pleasure and success, I did really cry in good earnest when\r\nI went to bed, to think that my expectations had done some good to\r\nsomebody.\r\n\r\nA great event in my life, the turning point of my life, now opens on my\r\nview. But, before I proceed to narrate it, and before I pass on to all\r\nthe changes it involved, I must give one chapter to Estella. It is not\r\nmuch to give to the theme that so long filled my heart.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXXVIII\r\n\r\nIf that staid old house near the Green at Richmond should ever come to\r\nbe haunted when I am dead, it will be haunted, surely, by my ghost. O\r\nthe many, many nights and days through which the unquiet spirit within\r\nme haunted that house when Estella lived there! Let my body be where it\r\nwould, my spirit was always wandering, wandering, wandering, about that\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\nThe lady with whom Estella was placed, Mrs. Brandley by name, was a\r\nwidow, with one daughter several years older than Estella. The mother\r\nlooked young, and the daughter looked old; the mother\xe2\x80\x99s complexion was\r\npink, and the daughter\xe2\x80\x99s was yellow; the mother set up for frivolity,\r\nand the daughter for theology. They were in what is called a good\r\nposition, and visited, and were visited by, numbers of people. Little,\r\nif any, community of feeling subsisted between them and Estella, but the\r\nunderstanding was established that they were necessary to her, and\r\nthat she was necessary to them. Mrs. Brandley had been a friend of Miss\r\nHavisham\xe2\x80\x99s before the time of her seclusion.\r\n\r\nIn Mrs. Brandley\xe2\x80\x99s house and out of Mrs. Brandley\xe2\x80\x99s house, I suffered\r\nevery kind and degree of torture that Estella could cause me. The\r\nnature of my relations with her, which placed me on terms of familiarity\r\nwithout placing me on terms of favor, conduced to my distraction.\r\nShe made use of me to tease other admirers, and she turned the very\r\nfamiliarity between herself and me to the account of putting a constant\r\nslight on my devotion to her. If I had been her secretary, steward,\r\nhalf-brother, poor relation,--if I had been a younger brother of her\r\nappointed husband,--I could not have seemed to myself further from my\r\nhopes when I was nearest to her. The privilege of calling her by her\r\nname and hearing her call me by mine became, under the circumstances\r\nan aggravation of my trials; and while I think it likely that it almost\r\nmaddened her other lovers, I know too certainly that it almost maddened\r\nme.\r\n\r\nShe had admirers without end. No doubt my jealousy made an admirer of\r\nevery one who went near her; but there were more than enough of them\r\nwithout that.\r\n\r\nI saw her often at Richmond, I heard of her often in town, and I used\r\noften to take her and the Brandleys on the water; there were picnics,\r\nf\xc3\xaate days, plays, operas, concerts, parties, all sorts of pleasures,\r\nthrough which I pursued her,--and they were all miseries to me. I never\r\nhad one hour\xe2\x80\x99s happiness in her society, and yet my mind all round the\r\nfour-and-twenty hours was harping on the happiness of having her with me\r\nunto death.\r\n\r\nThroughout this part of our intercourse,--and it lasted, as will\r\npresently be seen, for what I then thought a long time,--she habitually\r\nreverted to that tone which expressed that our association was forced\r\nupon us. There were other times when she would come to a sudden check in\r\nthis tone and in all her many tones, and would seem to pity me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPip, Pip,\xe2\x80\x9d she said one evening, coming to such a check, when we sat\r\napart at a darkening window of the house in Richmond; \xe2\x80\x9cwill you never\r\ntake warning?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf what?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWarning not to be attracted by you, do you mean, Estella?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo I mean! If you don\xe2\x80\x99t know what I mean, you are blind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI should have replied that Love was commonly reputed blind, but for the\r\nreason that I always was restrained--and this was not the least of my\r\nmiseries--by a feeling that it was ungenerous to press myself upon her,\r\nwhen she knew that she could not choose but obey Miss Havisham. My\r\ndread always was, that this knowledge on her part laid me under a heavy\r\ndisadvantage with her pride, and made me the subject of a rebellious\r\nstruggle in her bosom.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt any rate,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cI have no warning given me just now, for you\r\nwrote to me to come to you, this time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s true,\xe2\x80\x9d said Estella, with a cold careless smile that always\r\nchilled me.\r\n\r\nAfter looking at the twilight without, for a little while, she went on\r\nto say:--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe time has come round when Miss Havisham wishes to have me for a day\r\nat Satis. You are to take me there, and bring me back, if you will. She\r\nwould rather I did not travel alone, and objects to receiving my maid,\r\nfor she has a sensitive horror of being talked of by such people. Can\r\nyou take me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan I take you, Estella!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou can then? The day after to-morrow, if you please. You are to pay\r\nall charges out of my purse, You hear the condition of your going?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd must obey,\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\nThis was all the preparation I received for that visit, or for others\r\nlike it; Miss Havisham never wrote to me, nor had I ever so much as seen\r\nher handwriting. We went down on the next day but one, and we found her\r\nin the room where I had first beheld her, and it is needless to add that\r\nthere was no change in Satis House.\r\n\r\nShe was even more dreadfully fond of Estella than she had been when\r\nI last saw them together; I repeat the word advisedly, for there was\r\nsomething positively dreadful in the energy of her looks and embraces.\r\nShe hung upon Estella\xe2\x80\x99s beauty, hung upon her words, hung upon her\r\ngestures, and sat mumbling her own trembling fingers while she looked at\r\nher, as though she were devouring the beautiful creature she had reared.\r\n\r\nFrom Estella she looked at me, with a searching glance that seemed to\r\npry into my heart and probe its wounds. \xe2\x80\x9cHow does she use you, Pip; how\r\ndoes she use you?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked me again, with her witch-like eagerness,\r\neven in Estella\xe2\x80\x99s hearing. But, when we sat by her flickering fire\r\nat night, she was most weird; for then, keeping Estella\xe2\x80\x99s hand drawn\r\nthrough her arm and clutched in her own hand, she extorted from her,\r\nby dint of referring back to what Estella had told her in her regular\r\nletters, the names and conditions of the men whom she had fascinated;\r\nand as Miss Havisham dwelt upon this roll, with the intensity of a mind\r\nmortally hurt and diseased, she sat with her other hand on her crutch\r\nstick, and her chin on that, and her wan bright eyes glaring at me, a\r\nvery spectre.\r\n\r\nI saw in this, wretched though it made me, and bitter the sense of\r\ndependence and even of degradation that it awakened,--I saw in this that\r\nEstella was set to wreak Miss Havisham\xe2\x80\x99s revenge on men, and that she\r\nwas not to be given to me until she had gratified it for a term. I saw\r\nin this, a reason for her being beforehand assigned to me. Sending her\r\nout to attract and torment and do mischief, Miss Havisham sent her with\r\nthe malicious assurance that she was beyond the reach of all admirers,\r\nand that all who staked upon that cast were secured to lose. I saw in\r\nthis that I, too, was tormented by a perversion of ingenuity, even while\r\nthe prize was reserved for me. I saw in this the reason for my being\r\nstaved off so long and the reason for my late guardian\xe2\x80\x99s declining to\r\ncommit himself to the formal knowledge of such a scheme. In a word, I\r\nsaw in this Miss Havisham as I had her then and there before my eyes,\r\nand always had had her before my eyes; and I saw in this, the distinct\r\nshadow of the darkened and unhealthy house in which her life was hidden\r\nfrom the sun.\r\n\r\nThe candles that lighted that room of hers were placed in sconces on\r\nthe wall. They were high from the ground, and they burnt with the steady\r\ndulness of artificial light in air that is seldom renewed. As I looked\r\nround at them, and at the pale gloom they made, and at the stopped\r\nclock, and at the withered articles of bridal dress upon the table and\r\nthe ground, and at her own awful figure with its ghostly reflection\r\nthrown large by the fire upon the ceiling and the wall, I saw in\r\neverything the construction that my mind had come to, repeated and\r\nthrown back to me. My thoughts passed into the great room across the\r\nlanding where the table was spread, and I saw it written, as it were, in\r\nthe falls of the cobwebs from the centre-piece, in the crawlings of the\r\nspiders on the cloth, in the tracks of the mice as they betook their\r\nlittle quickened hearts behind the panels, and in the gropings and\r\npausings of the beetles on the floor.\r\n\r\nIt happened on the occasion of this visit that some sharp words arose\r\nbetween Estella and Miss Havisham. It was the first time I had ever seen\r\nthem opposed.\r\n\r\nWe were seated by the fire, as just now described, and Miss Havisham\r\nstill had Estella\xe2\x80\x99s arm drawn through her own, and still clutched\r\nEstella\xe2\x80\x99s hand in hers, when Estella gradually began to detach herself.\r\nShe had shown a proud impatience more than once before, and had rather\r\nendured that fierce affection than accepted or returned it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat!\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Havisham, flashing her eyes upon her, \xe2\x80\x9care you tired\r\nof me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly a little tired of myself,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Estella, disengaging her arm,\r\nand moving to the great chimney-piece, where she stood looking down at\r\nthe fire.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSpeak the truth, you ingrate!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Miss Havisham, passionately\r\nstriking her stick upon the floor; \xe2\x80\x9cyou are tired of me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEstella looked at her with perfect composure, and again looked down\r\nat the fire. Her graceful figure and her beautiful face expressed a\r\nself-possessed indifference to the wild heat of the other, that was\r\nalmost cruel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou stock and stone!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Miss Havisham. \xe2\x80\x9cYou cold, cold heart!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat?\xe2\x80\x9d said Estella, preserving her attitude of indifference as she\r\nleaned against the great chimney-piece and only moving her eyes; \xe2\x80\x9cdo you\r\nreproach me for being cold? You?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you not?\xe2\x80\x9d was the fierce retort.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou should know,\xe2\x80\x9d said Estella. \xe2\x80\x9cI am what you have made me. Take\r\nall the praise, take all the blame; take all the success, take all the\r\nfailure; in short, take me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO, look at her, look at her!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Miss Havisham, bitterly; \xe2\x80\x9cLook at\r\nher so hard and thankless, on the hearth where she was reared! Where I\r\ntook her into this wretched breast when it was first bleeding from its\r\nstabs, and where I have lavished years of tenderness upon her!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt least I was no party to the compact,\xe2\x80\x9d said Estella, \xe2\x80\x9cfor if I could\r\nwalk and speak, when it was made, it was as much as I could do. But what\r\nwould you have? You have been very good to me, and I owe everything to\r\nyou. What would you have?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLove,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the other.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have not,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Havisham.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMother by adoption,\xe2\x80\x9d retorted Estella, never departing from the easy\r\ngrace of her attitude, never raising her voice as the other did, never\r\nyielding either to anger or tenderness,--\xe2\x80\x9cmother by adoption, I have\r\nsaid that I owe everything to you. All I possess is freely yours. All\r\nthat you have given me, is at your command to have again. Beyond that, I\r\nhave nothing. And if you ask me to give you, what you never gave me, my\r\ngratitude and duty cannot do impossibilities.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid I never give her love!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Miss Havisham, turning wildly to me.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid I never give her a burning love, inseparable from jealousy at all\r\ntimes, and from sharp pain, while she speaks thus to me! Let her call me\r\nmad, let her call me mad!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy should I call you mad,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Estella, \xe2\x80\x9cI, of all people? Does\r\nany one live, who knows what set purposes you have, half as well as I\r\ndo? Does any one live, who knows what a steady memory you have, half\r\nas well as I do? I who have sat on this same hearth on the little stool\r\nthat is even now beside you there, learning your lessons and looking up\r\ninto your face, when your face was strange and frightened me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSoon forgotten!\xe2\x80\x9d moaned Miss Havisham. \xe2\x80\x9cTimes soon forgotten!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, not forgotten,\xe2\x80\x9d retorted Estella,--\xe2\x80\x9cnot forgotten, but treasured up\r\nin my memory. When have you found me false to your teaching? When have\r\nyou found me unmindful of your lessons? When have you found me giving\r\nadmission here,\xe2\x80\x9d she touched her bosom with her hand, \xe2\x80\x9cto anything that\r\nyou excluded? Be just to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo proud, so proud!\xe2\x80\x9d moaned Miss Havisham, pushing away her gray hair\r\nwith both her hands.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho taught me to be proud?\xe2\x80\x9d returned Estella. \xe2\x80\x9cWho praised me when I\r\nlearnt my lesson?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo hard, so hard!\xe2\x80\x9d moaned Miss Havisham, with her former action.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho taught me to be hard?\xe2\x80\x9d returned Estella. \xe2\x80\x9cWho praised me when I\r\nlearnt my lesson?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut to be proud and hard to me!\xe2\x80\x9d Miss Havisham quite shrieked, as she\r\nstretched out her arms. \xe2\x80\x9cEstella, Estella, Estella, to be proud and hard\r\nto me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEstella looked at her for a moment with a kind of calm wonder, but was\r\nnot otherwise disturbed; when the moment was past, she looked down at\r\nthe fire again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI cannot think,\xe2\x80\x9d said Estella, raising her eyes after a silence \xe2\x80\x9cwhy\r\nyou should be so unreasonable when I come to see you after a separation.\r\nI have never forgotten your wrongs and their causes. I have never been\r\nunfaithful to you or your schooling. I have never shown any weakness\r\nthat I can charge myself with.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWould it be weakness to return my love?\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Miss Havisham. \xe2\x80\x9cBut\r\nyes, yes, she would call it so!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI begin to think,\xe2\x80\x9d said Estella, in a musing way, after another moment\r\nof calm wonder, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I almost understand how this comes about. If you\r\nhad brought up your adopted daughter wholly in the dark confinement of\r\nthese rooms, and had never let her know that there was such a thing as\r\nthe daylight by which she had never once seen your face,--if you had\r\ndone that, and then, for a purpose had wanted her to understand the\r\ndaylight and know all about it, you would have been disappointed and\r\nangry?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Havisham, with her head in her hands, sat making a low moaning, and\r\nswaying herself on her chair, but gave no answer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOr,\xe2\x80\x9d said Estella,--\xe2\x80\x9cwhich is a nearer case,--if you had taught her,\r\nfrom the dawn of her intelligence, with your utmost energy and might,\r\nthat there was such a thing as daylight, but that it was made to be her\r\nenemy and destroyer, and she must always turn against it, for it had\r\nblighted you and would else blight her;--if you had done this, and then,\r\nfor a purpose, had wanted her to take naturally to the daylight and she\r\ncould not do it, you would have been disappointed and angry?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Havisham sat listening (or it seemed so, for I could not see her\r\nface), but still made no answer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Estella, \xe2\x80\x9cI must be taken as I have been made. The success is\r\nnot mine, the failure is not mine, but the two together make me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Havisham had settled down, I hardly knew how, upon the floor, among\r\nthe faded bridal relics with which it was strewn. I took advantage of\r\nthe moment--I had sought one from the first--to leave the room, after\r\nbeseeching Estella\xe2\x80\x99s attention to her, with a movement of my hand. When\r\nI left, Estella was yet standing by the great chimney-piece, just as she\r\nhad stood throughout. Miss Havisham\xe2\x80\x99s gray hair was all adrift upon the\r\nground, among the other bridal wrecks, and was a miserable sight to see.\r\n\r\nIt was with a depressed heart that I walked in the starlight for an\r\nhour and more, about the courtyard, and about the brewery, and about\r\nthe ruined garden. When I at last took courage to return to the room, I\r\nfound Estella sitting at Miss Havisham\xe2\x80\x99s knee, taking up some stitches\r\nin one of those old articles of dress that were dropping to pieces, and\r\nof which I have often been reminded since by the faded tatters of old\r\nbanners that I have seen hanging up in cathedrals. Afterwards, Estella\r\nand I played at cards, as of yore,--only we were skilful now, and played\r\nFrench games,--and so the evening wore away, and I went to bed.\r\n\r\nI lay in that separate building across the courtyard. It was the first\r\ntime I had ever lain down to rest in Satis House, and sleep refused to\r\ncome near me. A thousand Miss Havishams haunted me. She was on this side\r\nof my pillow, on that, at the head of the bed, at the foot, behind the\r\nhalf-opened door of the dressing-room, in the dressing-room, in the room\r\noverhead, in the room beneath,--everywhere. At last, when the night was\r\nslow to creep on towards two o\xe2\x80\x99clock, I felt that I absolutely could no\r\nlonger bear the place as a place to lie down in, and that I must get up.\r\nI therefore got up and put on my clothes, and went out across the yard\r\ninto the long stone passage, designing to gain the outer courtyard and\r\nwalk there for the relief of my mind. But I was no sooner in the passage\r\nthan I extinguished my candle; for I saw Miss Havisham going along it\r\nin a ghostly manner, making a low cry. I followed her at a distance,\r\nand saw her go up the staircase. She carried a bare candle in her hand,\r\nwhich she had probably taken from one of the sconces in her own room,\r\nand was a most unearthly object by its light. Standing at the bottom\r\nof the staircase, I felt the mildewed air of the feast-chamber, without\r\nseeing her open the door, and I heard her walking there, and so across\r\ninto her own room, and so across again into that, never ceasing the low\r\ncry. After a time, I tried in the dark both to get out, and to go back,\r\nbut I could do neither until some streaks of day strayed in and showed\r\nme where to lay my hands. During the whole interval, whenever I went to\r\nthe bottom of the staircase, I heard her footstep, saw her light pass\r\nabove, and heard her ceaseless low cry.\r\n\r\nBefore we left next day, there was no revival of the difference between\r\nher and Estella, nor was it ever revived on any similar occasion; and\r\nthere were four similar occasions, to the best of my remembrance. Nor,\r\ndid Miss Havisham\xe2\x80\x99s manner towards Estella in anywise change, except\r\nthat I believed it to have something like fear infused among its former\r\ncharacteristics.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to turn this leaf of my life, without putting Bentley\r\nDrummle\xe2\x80\x99s name upon it; or I would, very gladly.\r\n\r\nOn a certain occasion when the Finches were assembled in force, and when\r\ngood feeling was being promoted in the usual manner by nobody\xe2\x80\x99s agreeing\r\nwith anybody else, the presiding Finch called the Grove to order,\r\nforasmuch as Mr. Drummle had not yet toasted a lady; which, according\r\nto the solemn constitution of the society, it was the brute\xe2\x80\x99s turn to\r\ndo that day. I thought I saw him leer in an ugly way at me while the\r\ndecanters were going round, but as there was no love lost between us,\r\nthat might easily be. What was my indignant surprise when he called upon\r\nthe company to pledge him to \xe2\x80\x9cEstella!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEstella who?\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever you mind,\xe2\x80\x9d retorted Drummle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEstella of where?\xe2\x80\x9d said I. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are bound to say of where.\xe2\x80\x9d Which he\r\nwas, as a Finch.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf Richmond, gentlemen,\xe2\x80\x9d said Drummle, putting me out of the question,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cand a peerless beauty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMuch he knew about peerless beauties, a mean, miserable idiot! I\r\nwhispered Herbert.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know that lady,\xe2\x80\x9d said Herbert, across the table, when the toast had\r\nbeen honored.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you?\xe2\x80\x9d said Drummle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd so do I,\xe2\x80\x9d I added, with a scarlet face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you?\xe2\x80\x9d said Drummle. \xe2\x80\x9cO, Lord!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis was the only retort--except glass or crockery--that the heavy\r\ncreature was capable of making; but, I became as highly incensed by it\r\nas if it had been barbed with wit, and I immediately rose in my place\r\nand said that I could not but regard it as being like the honorable\r\nFinch\xe2\x80\x99s impudence to come down to that Grove,--we always talked\r\nabout coming down to that Grove, as a neat Parliamentary turn of\r\nexpression,--down to that Grove, proposing a lady of whom he knew\r\nnothing. Mr. Drummle, upon this, starting up, demanded what I meant by\r\nthat? Whereupon I made him the extreme reply that I believed he knew\r\nwhere I was to be found.\r\n\r\nWhether it was possible in a Christian country to get on without blood,\r\nafter this, was a question on which the Finches were divided. The debate\r\nupon it grew so lively, indeed, that at least six more honorable members\r\ntold six more, during the discussion, that they believed they knew where\r\nthey were to be found. However, it was decided at last (the Grove being\r\na Court of Honor) that if Mr. Drummle would bring never so slight\r\na certificate from the lady, importing that he had the honor of her\r\nacquaintance, Mr. Pip must express his regret, as a gentleman and a\r\nFinch, for \xe2\x80\x9chaving been betrayed into a warmth which.\xe2\x80\x9d Next day was\r\nappointed for the production (lest our honor should take cold from\r\ndelay), and next day Drummle appeared with a polite little avowal in\r\nEstella\xe2\x80\x99s hand, that she had had the honor of dancing with him several\r\ntimes. This left me no course but to regret that I had been \xe2\x80\x9cbetrayed\r\ninto a warmth which,\xe2\x80\x9d and on the whole to repudiate, as untenable, the\r\nidea that I was to be found anywhere. Drummle and I then sat snorting\r\nat one another for an hour, while the Grove engaged in indiscriminate\r\ncontradiction, and finally the promotion of good feeling was declared to\r\nhave gone ahead at an amazing rate.\r\n\r\nI tell this lightly, but it was no light thing to me. For, I cannot\r\nadequately express what pain it gave me to think that Estella should\r\nshow any favor to a contemptible, clumsy, sulky booby, so very far below\r\nthe average. To the present moment, I believe it to have been referable\r\nto some pure fire of generosity and disinterestedness in my love for\r\nher, that I could not endure the thought of her stooping to that hound.\r\nNo doubt I should have been miserable whomsoever she had favored; but\r\na worthier object would have caused me a different kind and degree of\r\ndistress.\r\n\r\nIt was easy for me to find out, and I did soon find out, that Drummle\r\nhad begun to follow her closely, and that she allowed him to do it. A\r\nlittle while, and he was always in pursuit of her, and he and I crossed\r\none another every day. He held on, in a dull persistent way, and Estella\r\nheld him on; now with encouragement, now with discouragement, now almost\r\nflattering him, now openly despising him, now knowing him very well, now\r\nscarcely remembering who he was.\r\n\r\nThe Spider, as Mr. Jaggers had called him, was used to lying in wait,\r\nhowever, and had the patience of his tribe. Added to that, he had a\r\nblockhead confidence in his money and in his family greatness,\r\nwhich sometimes did him good service,--almost taking the place of\r\nconcentration and determined purpose. So, the Spider, doggedly watching\r\nEstella, outwatched many brighter insects, and would often uncoil\r\nhimself and drop at the right nick of time.\r\n\r\nAt a certain Assembly Ball at Richmond (there used to be Assembly Balls\r\nat most places then), where Estella had outshone all other beauties,\r\nthis blundering Drummle so hung about her, and with so much toleration\r\non her part, that I resolved to speak to her concerning him. I took the\r\nnext opportunity; which was when she was waiting for Mrs. Blandley to\r\ntake her home, and was sitting apart among some flowers, ready to go.\r\nI was with her, for I almost always accompanied them to and from such\r\nplaces.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you tired, Estella?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRather, Pip.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou should be.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSay rather, I should not be; for I have my letter to Satis House to\r\nwrite, before I go to sleep.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRecounting to-night\xe2\x80\x99s triumph?\xe2\x80\x9d said I. \xe2\x80\x9cSurely a very poor one,\r\nEstella.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean? I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know there had been any.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEstella,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cdo look at that fellow in the corner yonder, who is\r\nlooking over here at us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy should I look at him?\xe2\x80\x9d returned Estella, with her eyes on me\r\ninstead. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is there in that fellow in the corner yonder,--to use\r\nyour words,--that I need look at?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed, that is the very question I want to ask you,\xe2\x80\x9d said I. \xe2\x80\x9cFor he\r\nhas been hovering about you all night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMoths, and all sorts of ugly creatures,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Estella, with a glance\r\ntowards him, \xe2\x80\x9chover about a lighted candle. Can the candle help it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d I returned; \xe2\x80\x9cbut cannot the Estella help it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell!\xe2\x80\x9d said she, laughing, after a moment, \xe2\x80\x9cperhaps. Yes. Anything you\r\nlike.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut, Estella, do hear me speak. It makes me wretched that you should\r\nencourage a man so generally despised as Drummle. You know he is\r\ndespised.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d said she.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know he is as ungainly within as without. A deficient,\r\nill-tempered, lowering, stupid fellow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d said she.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know he has nothing to recommend him but money and a ridiculous\r\nroll of addle-headed predecessors; now, don\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d said she again; and each time she said it, she opened her lovely\r\neyes the wider.\r\n\r\nTo overcome the difficulty of getting past that monosyllable, I took it\r\nfrom her, and said, repeating it with emphasis, \xe2\x80\x9cWell! Then, that is why\r\nit makes me wretched.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNow, if I could have believed that she favored Drummle with any idea of\r\nmaking me-me--wretched, I should have been in better heart about it;\r\nbut in that habitual way of hers, she put me so entirely out of the\r\nquestion, that I could believe nothing of the kind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPip,\xe2\x80\x9d said Estella, casting her glance over the room, \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t be foolish\r\nabout its effect on you. It may have its effect on others, and may be\r\nmeant to have. It\xe2\x80\x99s not worth discussing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes it is,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cbecause I cannot bear that people should say, \xe2\x80\x98she\r\nthrows away her graces and attractions on a mere boor, the lowest in the\r\ncrowd.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI can bear it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Estella.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! don\xe2\x80\x99t be so proud, Estella, and so inflexible.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCalls me proud and inflexible in this breath!\xe2\x80\x9d said Estella, opening\r\nher hands. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd in his last breath reproached me for stooping to a\r\nboor!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is no doubt you do,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, something hurriedly, \xe2\x80\x9cfor I have\r\nseen you give him looks and smiles this very night, such as you never\r\ngive to--me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you want me then,\xe2\x80\x9d said Estella, turning suddenly with a fixed and\r\nserious, if not angry, look, \xe2\x80\x9cto deceive and entrap you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you deceive and entrap him, Estella?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, and many others,--all of them but you. Here is Mrs. Brandley. I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nsay no more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n* *\r\n\r\nAnd now that I have given the one chapter to the theme that so filled my\r\nheart, and so often made it ache and ache again, I pass on unhindered,\r\nto the event that had impended over me longer yet; the event that had\r\nbegun to be prepared for, before I knew that the world held Estella,\r\nand in the days when her baby intelligence was receiving its first\r\ndistortions from Miss Havisham\xe2\x80\x99s wasting hands.\r\n\r\nIn the Eastern story, the heavy slab that was to fall on the bed of\r\nstate in the flush of conquest was slowly wrought out of the quarry, the\r\ntunnel for the rope to hold it in its place was slowly carried through\r\nthe leagues of rock, the slab was slowly raised and fitted in the roof,\r\nthe rope was rove to it and slowly taken through the miles of hollow to\r\nthe great iron ring. All being made ready with much labor, and the hour\r\ncome, the sultan was aroused in the dead of the night, and the sharpened\r\naxe that was to sever the rope from the great iron ring was put into his\r\nhand, and he struck with it, and the rope parted and rushed away, and\r\nthe ceiling fell. So, in my case; all the work, near and afar, that\r\ntended to the end, had been accomplished; and in an instant the blow was\r\nstruck, and the roof of my stronghold dropped upon me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXXIX\r\n\r\nI was three-and-twenty years of age. Not another word had I heard to\r\nenlighten me on the subject of my expectations, and my twenty-third\r\nbirthday was a week gone. We had left Barnard\xe2\x80\x99s Inn more than a year,\r\nand lived in the Temple. Our chambers were in Garden-court, down by the\r\nriver.\r\n\r\nMr. Pocket and I had for some time parted company as to our original\r\nrelations, though we continued on the best terms. Notwithstanding my\r\ninability to settle to anything,--which I hope arose out of the restless\r\nand incomplete tenure on which I held my means,--I had a taste for\r\nreading, and read regularly so many hours a day. That matter of\r\nHerbert\xe2\x80\x99s was still progressing, and everything with me was as I have\r\nbrought it down to the close of the last preceding chapter.\r\n\r\nBusiness had taken Herbert on a journey to Marseilles. I was alone, and\r\nhad a dull sense of being alone. Dispirited and anxious, long hoping\r\nthat to-morrow or next week would clear my way, and long disappointed, I\r\nsadly missed the cheerful face and ready response of my friend.\r\n\r\nIt was wretched weather; stormy and wet, stormy and wet; and mud, mud,\r\nmud, deep in all the streets. Day after day, a vast heavy veil had been\r\ndriving over London from the East, and it drove still, as if in the East\r\nthere were an Eternity of cloud and wind. So furious had been the gusts,\r\nthat high buildings in town had had the lead stripped off their roofs;\r\nand in the country, trees had been torn up, and sails of windmills\r\ncarried away; and gloomy accounts had come in from the coast, of\r\nshipwreck and death. Violent blasts of rain had accompanied these rages\r\nof wind, and the day just closed as I sat down to read had been the\r\nworst of all.\r\n\r\nAlterations have been made in that part of the Temple since that time,\r\nand it has not now so lonely a character as it had then, nor is it so\r\nexposed to the river. We lived at the top of the last house, and the\r\nwind rushing up the river shook the house that night, like discharges\r\nof cannon, or breakings of a sea. When the rain came with it and dashed\r\nagainst the windows, I thought, raising my eyes to them as they\r\nrocked, that I might have fancied myself in a storm-beaten lighthouse.\r\nOccasionally, the smoke came rolling down the chimney as though it could\r\nnot bear to go out into such a night; and when I set the doors open and\r\nlooked down the staircase, the staircase lamps were blown out; and when\r\nI shaded my face with my hands and looked through the black windows\r\n(opening them ever so little was out of the question in the teeth of\r\nsuch wind and rain), I saw that the lamps in the court were blown out,\r\nand that the lamps on the bridges and the shore were shuddering, and\r\nthat the coal-fires in barges on the river were being carried away\r\nbefore the wind like red-hot splashes in the rain.\r\n\r\nI read with my watch upon the table, purposing to close my book\r\nat eleven o\xe2\x80\x99clock. As I shut it, Saint Paul\xe2\x80\x99s, and all the many\r\nchurch-clocks in the City--some leading, some accompanying, some\r\nfollowing--struck that hour. The sound was curiously flawed by the wind;\r\nand I was listening, and thinking how the wind assailed and tore it,\r\nwhen I heard a footstep on the stair.\r\n\r\nWhat nervous folly made me start, and awfully connect it with the\r\nfootstep of my dead sister, matters not. It was past in a moment, and I\r\nlistened again, and heard the footstep stumble in coming on.\r\nRemembering then, that the staircase-lights were blown out, I took up\r\nmy reading-lamp and went out to the stair-head. Whoever was below had\r\nstopped on seeing my lamp, for all was quiet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is some one down there, is there not?\xe2\x80\x9d I called out, looking\r\ndown.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said a voice from the darkness beneath.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat floor do you want?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe top. Mr. Pip.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is my name.--There is nothing the matter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing the matter,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the voice. And the man came on.\r\n\r\nI stood with my lamp held out over the stair-rail, and he came slowly\r\nwithin its light. It was a shaded lamp, to shine upon a book, and its\r\ncircle of light was very contracted; so that he was in it for a mere\r\ninstant, and then out of it. In the instant, I had seen a face that was\r\nstrange to me, looking up with an incomprehensible air of being touched\r\nand pleased by the sight of me.\r\n\r\nMoving the lamp as the man moved, I made out that he was substantially\r\ndressed, but roughly, like a voyager by sea. That he had long iron-gray\r\nhair. That his age was about sixty. That he was a muscular man, strong\r\non his legs, and that he was browned and hardened by exposure to\r\nweather. As he ascended the last stair or two, and the light of my lamp\r\nincluded us both, I saw, with a stupid kind of amazement, that he was\r\nholding out both his hands to me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPray what is your business?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy business?\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated, pausing. \xe2\x80\x9cAh! Yes. I will explain my\r\nbusiness, by your leave.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you wish to come in?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied; \xe2\x80\x9cI wish to come in, master.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI had asked him the question inhospitably enough, for I resented the\r\nsort of bright and gratified recognition that still shone in his face.\r\nI resented it, because it seemed to imply that he expected me to respond\r\nto it. But I took him into the room I had just left, and, having set the\r\nlamp on the table, asked him as civilly as I could to explain himself.\r\n\r\nHe looked about him with the strangest air,--an air of wondering\r\npleasure, as if he had some part in the things he admired,--and he\r\npulled off a rough outer coat, and his hat. Then, I saw that his head\r\nwas furrowed and bald, and that the long iron-gray hair grew only on\r\nits sides. But, I saw nothing that in the least explained him. On the\r\ncontrary, I saw him next moment, once more holding out both his hands to\r\nme.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d said I, half suspecting him to be mad.\r\n\r\nHe stopped in his looking at me, and slowly rubbed his right hand over\r\nhis head. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s disapinting to a man,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, in a coarse broken\r\nvoice, \xe2\x80\x9carter having looked for\xe2\x80\x99ard so distant, and come so fur; but\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99re not to blame for that,--neither on us is to blame for that. I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nspeak in half a minute. Give me half a minute, please.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe sat down on a chair that stood before the fire, and covered his\r\nforehead with his large brown veinous hands. I looked at him attentively\r\nthen, and recoiled a little from him; but I did not know him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s no one nigh,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, looking over his shoulder; \xe2\x80\x9cis there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy do you, a stranger coming into my rooms at this time of the night,\r\nask that question?\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re a game one,\xe2\x80\x9d he returned, shaking his head at me with a\r\ndeliberate affection, at once most unintelligible and most exasperating;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m glad you\xe2\x80\x99ve grow\xe2\x80\x99d up, a game one! But don\xe2\x80\x99t catch hold of me.\r\nYou\xe2\x80\x99d be sorry arterwards to have done it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI relinquished the intention he had detected, for I knew him! Even yet\r\nI could not recall a single feature, but I knew him! If the wind and\r\nthe rain had driven away the intervening years, had scattered all the\r\nintervening objects, had swept us to the churchyard where we first stood\r\nface to face on such different levels, I could not have known my convict\r\nmore distinctly than I knew him now as he sat in the chair before the\r\nfire. No need to take a file from his pocket and show it to me; no need\r\nto take the handkerchief from his neck and twist it round his head; no\r\nneed to hug himself with both his arms, and take a shivering turn across\r\nthe room, looking back at me for recognition. I knew him before he gave\r\nme one of those aids, though, a moment before, I had not been conscious\r\nof remotely suspecting his identity.\r\n\r\nHe came back to where I stood, and again held out both his hands.\r\nNot knowing what to do,--for, in my astonishment I had lost my\r\nself-possession,--I reluctantly gave him my hands. He grasped them\r\nheartily, raised them to his lips, kissed them, and still held them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou acted noble, my boy,\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cNoble, Pip! And I have never forgot\r\nit!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt a change in his manner as if he were even going to embrace me, I laid\r\na hand upon his breast and put him away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStay!\xe2\x80\x9d said I. \xe2\x80\x9cKeep off! If you are grateful to me for what I did when\r\nI was a little child, I hope you have shown your gratitude by mending\r\nyour way of life. If you have come here to thank me, it was not\r\nnecessary. Still, however you have found me out, there must be something\r\ngood in the feeling that has brought you here, and I will not repulse\r\nyou; but surely you must understand that--I--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMy attention was so attracted by the singularity of his fixed look at\r\nme, that the words died away on my tongue.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou was a saying,\xe2\x80\x9d he observed, when we had confronted one another\r\nin silence, \xe2\x80\x9cthat surely I must understand. What, surely must I\r\nunderstand?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat I cannot wish to renew that chance intercourse with you of long\r\nago, under these different circumstances. I am glad to believe you have\r\nrepented and recovered yourself. I am glad to tell you so. I am glad\r\nthat, thinking I deserve to be thanked, you have come to thank me. But\r\nour ways are different ways, none the less. You are wet, and you look\r\nweary. Will you drink something before you go?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had replaced his neckerchief loosely, and had stood, keenly observant\r\nof me, biting a long end of it. \xe2\x80\x9cI think,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered, still with the\r\nend at his mouth and still observant of me, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I will drink (I thank\r\nyou) afore I go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was a tray ready on a side-table. I brought it to the table\r\nnear the fire, and asked him what he would have? He touched one of the\r\nbottles without looking at it or speaking, and I made him some hot rum\r\nand water. I tried to keep my hand steady while I did so, but his look\r\nat me as he leaned back in his chair with the long draggled end of his\r\nneckerchief between his teeth--evidently forgotten--made my hand very\r\ndifficult to master. When at last I put the glass to him, I saw with\r\namazement that his eyes were full of tears.\r\n\r\nUp to this time I had remained standing, not to disguise that I wished\r\nhim gone. But I was softened by the softened aspect of the man, and felt\r\na touch of reproach. \xe2\x80\x9cI hope,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, hurriedly putting something into\r\na glass for myself, and drawing a chair to the table, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you will not\r\nthink I spoke harshly to you just now. I had no intention of doing it,\r\nand I am sorry for it if I did. I wish you well and happy!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs I put my glass to my lips, he glanced with surprise at the end of his\r\nneckerchief, dropping from his mouth when he opened it, and stretched\r\nout his hand. I gave him mine, and then he drank, and drew his sleeve\r\nacross his eyes and forehead.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow are you living?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve been a sheep-farmer, stock-breeder, other trades besides, away in\r\nthe new world,\xe2\x80\x9d said he; \xe2\x80\x9cmany a thousand mile of stormy water off from\r\nthis.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope you have done well?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve done wonderfully well. There\xe2\x80\x99s others went out alonger me as has\r\ndone well too, but no man has done nigh as well as me. I\xe2\x80\x99m famous for\r\nit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am glad to hear it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope to hear you say so, my dear boy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWithout stopping to try to understand those words or the tone in which\r\nthey were spoken, I turned off to a point that had just come into my\r\nmind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you ever seen a messenger you once sent to me,\xe2\x80\x9d I inquired, \xe2\x80\x9csince\r\nhe undertook that trust?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever set eyes upon him. I warn\xe2\x80\x99t likely to it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe came faithfully, and he brought me the two one-pound notes. I was\r\na poor boy then, as you know, and to a poor boy they were a little\r\nfortune. But, like you, I have done well since, and you must let me pay\r\nthem back. You can put them to some other poor boy\xe2\x80\x99s use.\xe2\x80\x9d I took out my\r\npurse.\r\n\r\nHe watched me as I laid my purse upon the table and opened it, and he\r\nwatched me as I separated two one-pound notes from its contents. They\r\nwere clean and new, and I spread them out and handed them over to\r\nhim. Still watching me, he laid them one upon the other, folded them\r\nlong-wise, gave them a twist, set fire to them at the lamp, and dropped\r\nthe ashes into the tray.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay I make so bold,\xe2\x80\x9d he said then, with a smile that was like a frown,\r\nand with a frown that was like a smile, \xe2\x80\x9cas ask you how you have done\r\nwell, since you and me was out on them lone shivering marshes?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe emptied his glass, got up, and stood at the side of the fire, with\r\nhis heavy brown hand on the mantel-shelf. He put a foot up to the bars,\r\nto dry and warm it, and the wet boot began to steam; but, he neither\r\nlooked at it, nor at the fire, but steadily looked at me. It was only\r\nnow that I began to tremble.\r\n\r\nWhen my lips had parted, and had shaped some words that were\r\nwithout sound, I forced myself to tell him (though I could not do it\r\ndistinctly), that I had been chosen to succeed to some property.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMight a mere warmint ask what property?\xe2\x80\x9d said he.\r\n\r\nI faltered, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMight a mere warmint ask whose property?\xe2\x80\x9d said he.\r\n\r\nI faltered again, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCould I make a guess, I wonder,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Convict, \xe2\x80\x9cat your income\r\nsince you come of age! As to the first figure now. Five?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith my heart beating like a heavy hammer of disordered action, I rose\r\nout of my chair, and stood with my hand upon the back of it, looking\r\nwildly at him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cConcerning a guardian,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on. \xe2\x80\x9cThere ought to have been some\r\nguardian, or such-like, whiles you was a minor. Some lawyer, maybe. As\r\nto the first letter of that lawyer\xe2\x80\x99s name now. Would it be J?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAll the truth of my position came flashing on me; and its\r\ndisappointments, dangers, disgraces, consequences of all kinds, rushed\r\nin in such a multitude that I was borne down by them and had to struggle\r\nfor every breath I drew.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPut it,\xe2\x80\x9d he resumed, \xe2\x80\x9cas the employer of that lawyer whose name begun\r\nwith a J, and might be Jaggers,--put it as he had come over sea to\r\nPortsmouth, and had landed there, and had wanted to come on to you.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98However, you have found me out,\xe2\x80\x99 you says just now. Well! However, did\r\nI find you out? Why, I wrote from Portsmouth to a person in London, for\r\nparticulars of your address. That person\xe2\x80\x99s name? Why, Wemmick.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI could not have spoken one word, though it had been to save my life.\r\nI stood, with a hand on the chair-back and a hand on my breast, where\r\nI seemed to be suffocating,--I stood so, looking wildly at him, until I\r\ngrasped at the chair, when the room began to surge and turn. He caught\r\nme, drew me to the sofa, put me up against the cushions, and bent on one\r\nknee before me, bringing the face that I now well remembered, and that I\r\nshuddered at, very near to mine.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Pip, dear boy, I\xe2\x80\x99ve made a gentleman on you! It\xe2\x80\x99s me wot has\r\ndone it! I swore that time, sure as ever I earned a guinea, that guinea\r\nshould go to you. I swore arterwards, sure as ever I spec\xe2\x80\x99lated and got\r\nrich, you should get rich. I lived rough, that you should live smooth;\r\nI worked hard, that you should be above work. What odds, dear boy? Do I\r\ntell it, fur you to feel a obligation? Not a bit. I tell it, fur you to\r\nknow as that there hunted dunghill dog wot you kep life in, got his head\r\nso high that he could make a gentleman,--and, Pip, you\xe2\x80\x99re him!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe abhorrence in which I held the man, the dread I had of him, the\r\nrepugnance with which I shrank from him, could not have been exceeded if\r\nhe had been some terrible beast.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook\xe2\x80\x99ee here, Pip. I\xe2\x80\x99m your second father. You\xe2\x80\x99re my son,--more to me\r\nnor any son. I\xe2\x80\x99ve put away money, only for you to spend. When I was a\r\nhired-out shepherd in a solitary hut, not seeing no faces but faces of\r\nsheep till I half forgot wot men\xe2\x80\x99s and women\xe2\x80\x99s faces wos like, I see\r\nyourn. I drops my knife many a time in that hut when I was a-eating my\r\ndinner or my supper, and I says, \xe2\x80\x98Here\xe2\x80\x99s the boy again, a looking at\r\nme whiles I eats and drinks!\xe2\x80\x99 I see you there a many times, as plain as\r\never I see you on them misty marshes. \xe2\x80\x98Lord strike me dead!\xe2\x80\x99 I says each\r\ntime,--and I goes out in the air to say it under the open heavens,--\xe2\x80\x98but\r\nwot, if I gets liberty and money, I\xe2\x80\x99ll make that boy a gentleman!\xe2\x80\x99 And\r\nI done it. Why, look at you, dear boy! Look at these here lodgings\r\no\xe2\x80\x99yourn, fit for a lord! A lord? Ah! You shall show money with lords for\r\nwagers, and beat \xe2\x80\x98em!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn his heat and triumph, and in his knowledge that I had been nearly\r\nfainting, he did not remark on my reception of all this. It was the one\r\ngrain of relief I had.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook\xe2\x80\x99ee here!\xe2\x80\x9d he went on, taking my watch out of my pocket, and\r\nturning towards him a ring on my finger, while I recoiled from his\r\ntouch as if he had been a snake, \xe2\x80\x9ca gold \xe2\x80\x98un and a beauty: that\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\ngentleman\xe2\x80\x99s, I hope! A diamond all set round with rubies; that\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\ngentleman\xe2\x80\x99s, I hope! Look at your linen; fine and beautiful! Look at\r\nyour clothes; better ain\xe2\x80\x99t to be got! And your books too,\xe2\x80\x9d turning his\r\neyes round the room, \xe2\x80\x9cmounting up, on their shelves, by hundreds! And\r\nyou read \xe2\x80\x98em; don\xe2\x80\x99t you? I see you\xe2\x80\x99d been a reading of \xe2\x80\x98em when I come\r\nin. Ha, ha, ha! You shall read \xe2\x80\x98em to me, dear boy! And if they\xe2\x80\x99re in\r\nforeign languages wot I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand, I shall be just as proud as if\r\nI did.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAgain he took both my hands and put them to his lips, while my blood ran\r\ncold within me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you mind talking, Pip,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, after again drawing his sleeve\r\nover his eyes and forehead, as the click came in his throat which I well\r\nremembered,--and he was all the more horrible to me that he was so much\r\nin earnest; \xe2\x80\x9cyou can\xe2\x80\x99t do better nor keep quiet, dear boy. You ain\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nlooked slowly forward to this as I have; you wosn\xe2\x80\x99t prepared for this as\r\nI wos. But didn\xe2\x80\x99t you never think it might be me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO no, no, no,\xe2\x80\x9d I returned, \xe2\x80\x9cNever, never!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, you see it wos me, and single-handed. Never a soul in it but my\r\nown self and Mr. Jaggers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWas there no one else?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, with a glance of surprise: \xe2\x80\x9cwho else should there be?\r\nAnd, dear boy, how good looking you have growed! There\xe2\x80\x99s bright eyes\r\nsomewheres--eh? Isn\xe2\x80\x99t there bright eyes somewheres, wot you love the\r\nthoughts on?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nO Estella, Estella!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey shall be yourn, dear boy, if money can buy \xe2\x80\x98em. Not that a\r\ngentleman like you, so well set up as you, can\xe2\x80\x99t win \xe2\x80\x98em off of his own\r\ngame; but money shall back you! Let me finish wot I was a telling you,\r\ndear boy. From that there hut and that there hiring-out, I got money\r\nleft me by my master (which died, and had been the same as me), and got\r\nmy liberty and went for myself. In every single thing I went for, I went\r\nfor you. \xe2\x80\x98Lord strike a blight upon it,\xe2\x80\x99 I says, wotever it was I went\r\nfor, \xe2\x80\x98if it ain\xe2\x80\x99t for him!\xe2\x80\x99 It all prospered wonderful. As I giv\xe2\x80\x99 you\r\nto understand just now, I\xe2\x80\x99m famous for it. It was the money left me, and\r\nthe gains of the first few year wot I sent home to Mr. Jaggers--all for\r\nyou--when he first come arter you, agreeable to my letter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nO that he had never come! That he had left me at the forge,--far from\r\ncontented, yet, by comparison happy!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd then, dear boy, it was a recompense to me, look\xe2\x80\x99ee here, to know in\r\nsecret that I was making a gentleman. The blood horses of them colonists\r\nmight fling up the dust over me as I was walking; what do I say? I says\r\nto myself, \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m making a better gentleman nor ever you\xe2\x80\x99ll be!\xe2\x80\x99 When\r\none of \xe2\x80\x98em says to another, \xe2\x80\x98He was a convict, a few year ago, and is a\r\nignorant common fellow now, for all he\xe2\x80\x99s lucky,\xe2\x80\x99 what do I say? I says\r\nto myself, \xe2\x80\x98If I ain\xe2\x80\x99t a gentleman, nor yet ain\xe2\x80\x99t got no learning, I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nthe owner of such. All on you owns stock and land; which on you owns a\r\nbrought-up London gentleman?\xe2\x80\x99 This way I kep myself a going. And this\r\nway I held steady afore my mind that I would for certain come one day\r\nand see my boy, and make myself known to him, on his own ground.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe laid his hand on my shoulder. I shuddered at the thought that for\r\nanything I knew, his hand might be stained with blood.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt warn\xe2\x80\x99t easy, Pip, for me to leave them parts, nor yet it warn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nsafe. But I held to it, and the harder it was, the stronger I held, for\r\nI was determined, and my mind firm made up. At last I done it. Dear boy,\r\nI done it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI tried to collect my thoughts, but I was stunned. Throughout, I had\r\nseemed to myself to attend more to the wind and the rain than to him;\r\neven now, I could not separate his voice from those voices, though those\r\nwere loud and his was silent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere will you put me?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, presently. \xe2\x80\x9cI must be put somewheres,\r\ndear boy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo sleep?\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. And to sleep long and sound,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered; \xe2\x80\x9cfor I\xe2\x80\x99ve been\r\nsea-tossed and sea-washed, months and months.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy friend and companion,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, rising from the sofa, \xe2\x80\x9cis absent; you\r\nmust have his room.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe won\xe2\x80\x99t come back to-morrow; will he?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, answering almost mechanically, in spite of my utmost\r\nefforts; \xe2\x80\x9cnot to-morrow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause, look\xe2\x80\x99ee here, dear boy,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, dropping his voice, and\r\nlaying a long finger on my breast in an impressive manner, \xe2\x80\x9ccaution is\r\nnecessary.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do you mean? Caution?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy G----, it\xe2\x80\x99s Death!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s death?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was sent for life. It\xe2\x80\x99s death to come back. There\xe2\x80\x99s been overmuch\r\ncoming back of late years, and I should of a certainty be hanged if\r\ntook.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNothing was needed but this; the wretched man, after loading wretched me\r\nwith his gold and silver chains for years, had risked his life to come\r\nto me, and I held it there in my keeping! If I had loved him instead\r\nof abhorring him; if I had been attracted to him by the strongest\r\nadmiration and affection, instead of shrinking from him with the\r\nstrongest repugnance; it could have been no worse. On the contrary, it\r\nwould have been better, for his preservation would then have naturally\r\nand tenderly addressed my heart.\r\n\r\nMy first care was to close the shutters, so that no light might be seen\r\nfrom without, and then to close and make fast the doors. While I did so,\r\nhe stood at the table drinking rum and eating biscuit; and when I saw\r\nhim thus engaged, I saw my convict on the marshes at his meal again. It\r\nalmost seemed to me as if he must stoop down presently, to file at his\r\nleg.\r\n\r\nWhen I had gone into Herbert\xe2\x80\x99s room, and had shut off any other\r\ncommunication between it and the staircase than through the room in\r\nwhich our conversation had been held, I asked him if he would go to bed?\r\nHe said yes, but asked me for some of my \xe2\x80\x9cgentleman\xe2\x80\x99s linen\xe2\x80\x9d to put\r\non in the morning. I brought it out, and laid it ready for him, and my\r\nblood again ran cold when he again took me by both hands to give me good\r\nnight.\r\n\r\nI got away from him, without knowing how I did it, and mended the fire\r\nin the room where we had been together, and sat down by it, afraid to go\r\nto bed. For an hour or more, I remained too stunned to think; and it\r\nwas not until I began to think, that I began fully to know how wrecked I\r\nwas, and how the ship in which I had sailed was gone to pieces.\r\n\r\nMiss Havisham\xe2\x80\x99s intentions towards me, all a mere dream; Estella not\r\ndesigned for me; I only suffered in Satis House as a convenience, a\r\nsting for the greedy relations, a model with a mechanical heart to\r\npractise on when no other practice was at hand; those were the first\r\nsmarts I had. But, sharpest and deepest pain of all,--it was for the\r\nconvict, guilty of I knew not what crimes, and liable to be taken out\r\nof those rooms where I sat thinking, and hanged at the Old Bailey door,\r\nthat I had deserted Joe.\r\n\r\nI would not have gone back to Joe now, I would not have gone back to\r\nBiddy now, for any consideration; simply, I suppose, because my sense of\r\nmy own worthless conduct to them was greater than every consideration.\r\nNo wisdom on earth could have given me the comfort that I should have\r\nderived from their simplicity and fidelity; but I could never, never,\r\nundo what I had done.\r\n\r\nIn every rage of wind and rush of rain, I heard pursuers. Twice, I could\r\nhave sworn there was a knocking and whispering at the outer door. With\r\nthese fears upon me, I began either to imagine or recall that I had had\r\nmysterious warnings of this man\xe2\x80\x99s approach. That, for weeks gone by, I\r\nhad passed faces in the streets which I had thought like his. That these\r\nlikenesses had grown more numerous, as he, coming over the sea, had\r\ndrawn nearer. That his wicked spirit had somehow sent these messengers\r\nto mine, and that now on this stormy night he was as good as his word,\r\nand with me.\r\n\r\nCrowding up with these reflections came the reflection that I had seen\r\nhim with my childish eyes to be a desperately violent man; that I had\r\nheard that other convict reiterate that he had tried to murder him; that\r\nI had seen him down in the ditch tearing and fighting like a wild\r\nbeast. Out of such remembrances I brought into the light of the fire a\r\nhalf-formed terror that it might not be safe to be shut up there with\r\nhim in the dead of the wild solitary night. This dilated until it filled\r\nthe room, and impelled me to take a candle and go in and look at my\r\ndreadful burden.\r\n\r\nHe had rolled a handkerchief round his head, and his face was set and\r\nlowering in his sleep. But he was asleep, and quietly too, though he had\r\na pistol lying on the pillow. Assured of this, I softly removed the key\r\nto the outside of his door, and turned it on him before I again sat down\r\nby the fire. Gradually I slipped from the chair and lay on the floor.\r\nWhen I awoke without having parted in my sleep with the perception of\r\nmy wretchedness, the clocks of the Eastward churches were striking five,\r\nthe candles were wasted out, the fire was dead, and the wind and rain\r\nintensified the thick black darkness.\r\n\r\nTHIS IS THE END OF THE SECOND STAGE OF PIP\xe2\x80\x99S EXPECTATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XL\r\n\r\nIt was fortunate for me that I had to take precautions to ensure (so far\r\nas I could) the safety of my dreaded visitor; for, this thought pressing\r\non me when I awoke, held other thoughts in a confused concourse at a\r\ndistance.\r\n\r\nThe impossibility of keeping him concealed in the chambers was\r\nself-evident. It could not be done, and the attempt to do it would\r\ninevitably engender suspicion. True, I had no Avenger in my service now,\r\nbut I was looked after by an inflammatory old female, assisted by an\r\nanimated rag-bag whom she called her niece, and to keep a room secret\r\nfrom them would be to invite curiosity and exaggeration. They both had\r\nweak eyes, which I had long attributed to their chronically looking in\r\nat keyholes, and they were always at hand when not wanted; indeed that\r\nwas their only reliable quality besides larceny. Not to get up a mystery\r\nwith these people, I resolved to announce in the morning that my uncle\r\nhad unexpectedly come from the country.\r\n\r\nThis course I decided on while I was yet groping about in the darkness\r\nfor the means of getting a light. Not stumbling on the means after all,\r\nI was fain to go out to the adjacent Lodge and get the watchman there to\r\ncome with his lantern. Now, in groping my way down the black staircase I\r\nfell over something, and that something was a man crouching in a corner.\r\n\r\nAs the man made no answer when I asked him what he did there, but eluded\r\nmy touch in silence, I ran to the Lodge and urged the watchman to come\r\nquickly; telling him of the incident on the way back. The wind being as\r\nfierce as ever, we did not care to endanger the light in the lantern by\r\nrekindling the extinguished lamps on the staircase, but we examined the\r\nstaircase from the bottom to the top and found no one there. It then\r\noccurred to me as possible that the man might have slipped into my\r\nrooms; so, lighting my candle at the watchman\xe2\x80\x99s, and leaving him\r\nstanding at the door, I examined them carefully, including the room in\r\nwhich my dreaded guest lay asleep. All was quiet, and assuredly no other\r\nman was in those chambers.\r\n\r\nIt troubled me that there should have been a lurker on the stairs, on\r\nthat night of all nights in the year, and I asked the watchman, on the\r\nchance of eliciting some hopeful explanation as I handed him a dram\r\nat the door, whether he had admitted at his gate any gentleman who had\r\nperceptibly been dining out? Yes, he said; at different times of the\r\nnight, three. One lived in Fountain Court, and the other two lived in\r\nthe Lane, and he had seen them all go home. Again, the only other man\r\nwho dwelt in the house of which my chambers formed a part had been in\r\nthe country for some weeks, and he certainly had not returned in the\r\nnight, because we had seen his door with his seal on it as we came\r\nupstairs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe night being so bad, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said the watchman, as he gave me back\r\nmy glass, \xe2\x80\x9cuncommon few have come in at my gate. Besides them three\r\ngentlemen that I have named, I don\xe2\x80\x99t call to mind another since about\r\neleven o\xe2\x80\x99clock, when a stranger asked for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy uncle,\xe2\x80\x9d I muttered. \xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou saw him, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. Oh yes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLikewise the person with him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerson with him!\xe2\x80\x9d I repeated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI judged the person to be with him,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the watchman. \xe2\x80\x9cThe person\r\nstopped, when he stopped to make inquiry of me, and the person took this\r\nway when he took this way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat sort of person?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe watchman had not particularly noticed; he should say a working\r\nperson; to the best of his belief, he had a dust-colored kind of clothes\r\non, under a dark coat. The watchman made more light of the matter than I\r\ndid, and naturally; not having my reason for attaching weight to it.\r\n\r\nWhen I had got rid of him, which I thought it well to do without\r\nprolonging explanations, my mind was much troubled by these two\r\ncircumstances taken together. Whereas they were easy of innocent\r\nsolution apart,--as, for instance, some diner out or diner at home,\r\nwho had not gone near this watchman\xe2\x80\x99s gate, might have strayed to my\r\nstaircase and dropped asleep there,--and my nameless visitor might have\r\nbrought some one with him to show him the way,--still, joined, they had\r\nan ugly look to one as prone to distrust and fear as the changes of a\r\nfew hours had made me.\r\n\r\nI lighted my fire, which burnt with a raw pale flare at that time of the\r\nmorning, and fell into a doze before it. I seemed to have been dozing a\r\nwhole night when the clocks struck six. As there was full an hour and\r\na half between me and daylight, I dozed again; now, waking up uneasily,\r\nwith prolix conversations about nothing, in my ears; now, making thunder\r\nof the wind in the chimney; at length, falling off into a profound sleep\r\nfrom which the daylight woke me with a start.\r\n\r\nAll this time I had never been able to consider my own situation, nor\r\ncould I do so yet. I had not the power to attend to it. I was greatly\r\ndejected and distressed, but in an incoherent wholesale sort of way.\r\nAs to forming any plan for the future, I could as soon have formed an\r\nelephant. When I opened the shutters and looked out at the wet wild\r\nmorning, all of a leaden hue; when I walked from room to room; when I\r\nsat down again shivering, before the fire, waiting for my laundress to\r\nappear; I thought how miserable I was, but hardly knew why, or how long\r\nI had been so, or on what day of the week I made the reflection, or even\r\nwho I was that made it.\r\n\r\nAt last, the old woman and the niece came in,--the latter with a head\r\nnot easily distinguishable from her dusty broom,--and testified surprise\r\nat sight of me and the fire. To whom I imparted how my uncle had come in\r\nthe night and was then asleep, and how the breakfast preparations were\r\nto be modified accordingly. Then I washed and dressed while they knocked\r\nthe furniture about and made a dust; and so, in a sort of dream\r\nor sleep-waking, I found myself sitting by the fire again, waiting\r\nfor--Him--to come to breakfast.\r\n\r\nBy and by, his door opened and he came out. I could not bring myself to\r\nbear the sight of him, and I thought he had a worse look by daylight.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do not even know,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, speaking low as he took his seat at the\r\ntable, \xe2\x80\x9cby what name to call you. I have given out that you are my\r\nuncle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s it, dear boy! Call me uncle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou assumed some name, I suppose, on board ship?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, dear boy. I took the name of Provis.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean to keep that name?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, yes, dear boy, it\xe2\x80\x99s as good as another,--unless you\xe2\x80\x99d like\r\nanother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is your real name?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked him in a whisper.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMagwitch,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered, in the same tone; \xe2\x80\x9cchrisen\xe2\x80\x99d Abel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat were you brought up to be?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA warmint, dear boy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe answered quite seriously, and used the word as if it denoted some\r\nprofession.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen you came into the Temple last night--\xe2\x80\x9d said I, pausing to wonder\r\nwhether that could really have been last night, which seemed so long\r\nago.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, dear boy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen you came in at the gate and asked the watchman the way here, had\r\nyou any one with you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith me? No, dear boy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut there was some one there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t take particular notice,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, dubiously, \xe2\x80\x9cnot knowing the\r\nways of the place. But I think there was a person, too, come in alonger\r\nme.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you known in London?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI hope not!\xe2\x80\x9d said he, giving his neck a jerk with his forefinger that\r\nmade me turn hot and sick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWere you known in London, once?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot over and above, dear boy. I was in the provinces mostly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWere you--tried--in London?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhich time?\xe2\x80\x9d said he, with a sharp look.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe last time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe nodded. \xe2\x80\x9cFirst knowed Mr. Jaggers that way. Jaggers was for me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was on my lips to ask him what he was tried for, but he took up\r\na knife, gave it a flourish, and with the words, \xe2\x80\x9cAnd what I done is\r\nworked out and paid for!\xe2\x80\x9d fell to at his breakfast.\r\n\r\nHe ate in a ravenous way that was very disagreeable, and all his actions\r\nwere uncouth, noisy, and greedy. Some of his teeth had failed him since\r\nI saw him eat on the marshes, and as he turned his food in his mouth,\r\nand turned his head sideways to bring his strongest fangs to bear upon\r\nit, he looked terribly like a hungry old dog. If I had begun with any\r\nappetite, he would have taken it away, and I should have sat much as\r\nI did,--repelled from him by an insurmountable aversion, and gloomily\r\nlooking at the cloth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m a heavy grubber, dear boy,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, as a polite kind of apology\r\nwhen he made an end of his meal, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I always was. If it had been in\r\nmy constitution to be a lighter grubber, I might ha\xe2\x80\x99 got into lighter\r\ntrouble. Similarly, I must have my smoke. When I was first hired out as\r\nshepherd t\xe2\x80\x99other side the world, it\xe2\x80\x99s my belief I should ha\xe2\x80\x99 turned into\r\na molloncolly-mad sheep myself, if I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t a had my smoke.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs he said so, he got up from table, and putting his hand into the\r\nbreast of the pea-coat he wore, brought out a short black pipe, and a\r\nhandful of loose tobacco of the kind that is called Negro-head. Having\r\nfilled his pipe, he put the surplus tobacco back again, as if his pocket\r\nwere a drawer. Then, he took a live coal from the fire with the tongs,\r\nand lighted his pipe at it, and then turned round on the hearth-rug with\r\nhis back to the fire, and went through his favorite action of holding\r\nout both his hands for mine.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd this,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, dandling my hands up and down in his, as he puffed\r\nat his pipe,--\xe2\x80\x9cand this is the gentleman what I made! The real genuine\r\nOne! It does me good fur to look at you, Pip. All I stip\xe2\x80\x99late, is, to\r\nstand by and look at you, dear boy!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI released my hands as soon as I could, and found that I was beginning\r\nslowly to settle down to the contemplation of my condition. What I was\r\nchained to, and how heavily, became intelligible to me, as I heard his\r\nhoarse voice, and sat looking up at his furrowed bald head with its iron\r\ngray hair at the sides.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI mustn\xe2\x80\x99t see my gentleman a footing it in the mire of the streets;\r\nthere mustn\xe2\x80\x99t be no mud on his boots. My gentleman must have horses,\r\nPip! Horses to ride, and horses to drive, and horses for his servant\r\nto ride and drive as well. Shall colonists have their horses (and blood\r\n\xe2\x80\x98uns, if you please, good Lord!) and not my London gentleman? No, no.\r\nWe\xe2\x80\x99ll show \xe2\x80\x98em another pair of shoes than that, Pip; won\xe2\x80\x99t us?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe took out of his pocket a great thick pocket-book, bursting with\r\npapers, and tossed it on the table.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s something worth spending in that there book, dear boy. It\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nyourn. All I\xe2\x80\x99ve got ain\xe2\x80\x99t mine; it\xe2\x80\x99s yourn. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you be afeerd on it.\r\nThere\xe2\x80\x99s more where that come from. I\xe2\x80\x99ve come to the old country fur\r\nto see my gentleman spend his money like a gentleman. That\xe2\x80\x99ll be my\r\npleasure. My pleasure \xe2\x80\x98ull be fur to see him do it. And blast you all!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n he wound up, looking round the room and snapping his fingers once with\r\na loud snap, \xe2\x80\x9cblast you every one, from the judge in his wig, to the\r\ncolonist a stirring up the dust, I\xe2\x80\x99ll show a better gentleman than the\r\nwhole kit on you put together!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStop!\xe2\x80\x9d said I, almost in a frenzy of fear and dislike, \xe2\x80\x9cI want to speak\r\nto you. I want to know what is to be done. I want to know how you are to\r\nbe kept out of danger, how long you are going to stay, what projects you\r\nhave.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook\xe2\x80\x99ee here, Pip,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, laying his hand on my arm in a suddenly\r\naltered and subdued manner; \xe2\x80\x9cfirst of all, look\xe2\x80\x99ee here. I forgot myself\r\nhalf a minute ago. What I said was low; that\xe2\x80\x99s what it was; low. Look\xe2\x80\x99ee\r\nhere, Pip. Look over it. I ain\xe2\x80\x99t a going to be low.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFirst,\xe2\x80\x9d I resumed, half groaning, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat precautions can be taken\r\nagainst your being recognized and seized?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, dear boy,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, in the same tone as before, \xe2\x80\x9cthat don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ngo first. Lowness goes first. I ain\xe2\x80\x99t took so many year to make a\r\ngentleman, not without knowing what\xe2\x80\x99s due to him. Look\xe2\x80\x99ee here, Pip. I\r\nwas low; that\xe2\x80\x99s what I was; low. Look over it, dear boy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSome sense of the grimly-ludicrous moved me to a fretful laugh, as I\r\nreplied, \xe2\x80\x9cI have looked over it. In Heaven\xe2\x80\x99s name, don\xe2\x80\x99t harp upon it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, but look\xe2\x80\x99ee here,\xe2\x80\x9d he persisted. \xe2\x80\x9cDear boy, I ain\xe2\x80\x99t come so fur,\r\nnot fur to be low. Now, go on, dear boy. You was a saying--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow are you to be guarded from the danger you have incurred?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, dear boy, the danger ain\xe2\x80\x99t so great. Without I was informed\r\nagen, the danger ain\xe2\x80\x99t so much to signify. There\xe2\x80\x99s Jaggers, and there\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nWemmick, and there\xe2\x80\x99s you. Who else is there to inform?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs there no chance person who might identify you in the street?\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nI.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d he returned, \xe2\x80\x9cthere ain\xe2\x80\x99t many. Nor yet I don\xe2\x80\x99t intend to\r\nadvertise myself in the newspapers by the name of A.M. come back from\r\nBotany Bay; and years have rolled away, and who\xe2\x80\x99s to gain by it? Still,\r\nlook\xe2\x80\x99ee here, Pip. If the danger had been fifty times as great, I should\r\nha\xe2\x80\x99 come to see you, mind you, just the same.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd how long do you remain?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow long?\xe2\x80\x9d said he, taking his black pipe from his mouth, and dropping\r\nhis jaw as he stared at me. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not a going back. I\xe2\x80\x99ve come for good.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere are you to live?\xe2\x80\x9d said I. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is to be done with you? Where\r\nwill you be safe?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear boy,\xe2\x80\x9d he returned, \xe2\x80\x9cthere\xe2\x80\x99s disguising wigs can be bought\r\nfor money, and there\xe2\x80\x99s hair powder, and spectacles, and black\r\nclothes,--shorts and what not. Others has done it safe afore, and what\r\nothers has done afore, others can do agen. As to the where and how of\r\nliving, dear boy, give me your own opinions on it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou take it smoothly now,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cbut you were very serious last\r\nnight, when you swore it was Death.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd so I swear it is Death,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, putting his pipe back in his\r\nmouth, \xe2\x80\x9cand Death by the rope, in the open street not fur from this, and\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s serious that you should fully understand it to be so. What then,\r\nwhen that\xe2\x80\x99s once done? Here I am. To go back now \xe2\x80\x98ud be as bad as to\r\nstand ground--worse. Besides, Pip, I\xe2\x80\x99m here, because I\xe2\x80\x99ve meant it by\r\nyou, years and years. As to what I dare, I\xe2\x80\x99m a old bird now, as has\r\ndared all manner of traps since first he was fledged, and I\xe2\x80\x99m not afeerd\r\nto perch upon a scarecrow. If there\xe2\x80\x99s Death hid inside of it, there is,\r\nand let him come out, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll face him, and then I\xe2\x80\x99ll believe in him\r\nand not afore. And now let me have a look at my gentleman agen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOnce more, he took me by both hands and surveyed me with an air of\r\nadmiring proprietorship: smoking with great complacency all the while.\r\n\r\nIt appeared to me that I could do no better than secure him some\r\nquiet lodging hard by, of which he might take possession when Herbert\r\nreturned: whom I expected in two or three days. That the secret must\r\nbe confided to Herbert as a matter of unavoidable necessity, even if I\r\ncould have put the immense relief I should derive from sharing it with\r\nhim out of the question, was plain to me. But it was by no means so\r\nplain to Mr. Provis (I resolved to call him by that name), who reserved\r\nhis consent to Herbert\xe2\x80\x99s participation until he should have seen him\r\nand formed a favorable judgment of his physiognomy. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd even then, dear\r\nboy,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, pulling a greasy little clasped black Testament out of\r\nhis pocket, \xe2\x80\x9cwe\xe2\x80\x99ll have him on his oath.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nTo state that my terrible patron carried this little black book about\r\nthe world solely to swear people on in cases of emergency, would be to\r\nstate what I never quite established; but this I can say, that I never\r\nknew him put it to any other use. The book itself had the appearance of\r\nhaving been stolen from some court of justice, and perhaps his knowledge\r\nof its antecedents, combined with his own experience in that wise, gave\r\nhim a reliance on its powers as a sort of legal spell or charm. On this\r\nfirst occasion of his producing it, I recalled how he had made me swear\r\nfidelity in the churchyard long ago, and how he had described himself\r\nlast night as always swearing to his resolutions in his solitude.\r\n\r\nAs he was at present dressed in a seafaring slop suit, in which he\r\nlooked as if he had some parrots and cigars to dispose of, I next\r\ndiscussed with him what dress he should wear. He cherished an\r\nextraordinary belief in the virtues of \xe2\x80\x9cshorts\xe2\x80\x9d as a disguise, and had\r\nin his own mind sketched a dress for himself that would have made\r\nhim something between a dean and a dentist. It was with considerable\r\ndifficulty that I won him over to the assumption of a dress more like a\r\nprosperous farmer\xe2\x80\x99s; and we arranged that he should cut his hair close,\r\nand wear a little powder. Lastly, as he had not yet been seen by the\r\nlaundress or her niece, he was to keep himself out of their view until\r\nhis change of dress was made.\r\n\r\nIt would seem a simple matter to decide on these precautions; but in my\r\ndazed, not to say distracted, state, it took so long, that I did not\r\nget out to further them until two or three in the afternoon. He was to\r\nremain shut up in the chambers while I was gone, and was on no account\r\nto open the door.\r\n\r\nThere being to my knowledge a respectable lodging-house in Essex Street,\r\nthe back of which looked into the Temple, and was almost within hail of\r\nmy windows, I first of all repaired to that house, and was so fortunate\r\nas to secure the second floor for my uncle, Mr. Provis. I then went from\r\nshop to shop, making such purchases as were necessary to the change in\r\nhis appearance. This business transacted, I turned my face, on my own\r\naccount, to Little Britain. Mr. Jaggers was at his desk, but, seeing me\r\nenter, got up immediately and stood before his fire.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, Pip,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cbe careful.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d I returned. For, coming along I had thought well of what\r\nI was going to say.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t commit yourself,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Jaggers, \xe2\x80\x9cand don\xe2\x80\x99t commit any one.\r\nYou understand--any one. Don\xe2\x80\x99t tell me anything: I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to know\r\nanything; I am not curious.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOf course I saw that he knew the man was come.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI merely want, Mr. Jaggers,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cto assure myself that what I have\r\nbeen told is true. I have no hope of its being untrue, but at least I\r\nmay verify it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Jaggers nodded. \xe2\x80\x9cBut did you say \xe2\x80\x98told\xe2\x80\x99 or \xe2\x80\x98informed\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked\r\nme, with his head on one side, and not looking at me, but looking in\r\na listening way at the floor. \xe2\x80\x9cTold would seem to imply verbal\r\ncommunication. You can\xe2\x80\x99t have verbal communication with a man in New\r\nSouth Wales, you know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will say, informed, Mr. Jaggers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have been informed by a person named Abel Magwitch, that he is the\r\nbenefactor so long unknown to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is the man,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Jaggers, \xe2\x80\x9cin New South Wales.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd only he?\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd only he,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Jaggers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not so unreasonable, sir, as to think you at all responsible for\r\nmy mistakes and wrong conclusions; but I always supposed it was Miss\r\nHavisham.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs you say, Pip,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Mr. Jaggers, turning his eyes upon\r\nme coolly, and taking a bite at his forefinger, \xe2\x80\x9cI am not at all\r\nresponsible for that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd yet it looked so like it, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d I pleaded with a downcast heart.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot a particle of evidence, Pip,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Jaggers, shaking his head\r\nand gathering up his skirts. \xe2\x80\x9cTake nothing on its looks; take everything\r\non evidence. There\xe2\x80\x99s no better rule.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have no more to say,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, with a sigh, after standing silent for\r\na little while. \xe2\x80\x9cI have verified my information, and there\xe2\x80\x99s an end.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd Magwitch--in New South Wales--having at last disclosed himself,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n said Mr. Jaggers, \xe2\x80\x9cyou will comprehend, Pip, how rigidly throughout\r\nmy communication with you, I have always adhered to the strict line of\r\nfact. There has never been the least departure from the strict line of\r\nfact. You are quite aware of that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI communicated to Magwitch--in New South Wales--when he first wrote to\r\nme--from New South Wales--the caution that he must not expect me ever to\r\ndeviate from the strict line of fact. I also communicated to him another\r\ncaution. He appeared to me to have obscurely hinted in his letter at\r\nsome distant idea he had of seeing you in England here. I cautioned\r\nhim that I must hear no more of that; that he was not at all likely to\r\nobtain a pardon; that he was expatriated for the term of his natural\r\nlife; and that his presenting himself in this country would be an act of\r\nfelony, rendering him liable to the extreme penalty of the law. I gave\r\nMagwitch that caution,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Jaggers, looking hard at me; \xe2\x80\x9cI wrote\r\nit to New South Wales. He guided himself by it, no doubt.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo doubt,\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have been informed by Wemmick,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued Mr. Jaggers, still looking\r\nhard at me, \xe2\x80\x9cthat he has received a letter, under date Portsmouth, from\r\na colonist of the name of Purvis, or--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOr Provis,\xe2\x80\x9d I suggested.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOr Provis--thank you, Pip. Perhaps it is Provis? Perhaps you know it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nProvis?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou know it\xe2\x80\x99s Provis. A letter, under date Portsmouth, from a colonist\r\nof the name of Provis, asking for the particulars of your address, on\r\nbehalf of Magwitch. Wemmick sent him the particulars, I understand, by\r\nreturn of post. Probably it is through Provis that you have received the\r\nexplanation of Magwitch--in New South Wales?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt came through Provis,\xe2\x80\x9d I replied.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood day, Pip,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Jaggers, offering his hand; \xe2\x80\x9cglad to have\r\nseen you. In writing by post to Magwitch--in New South Wales--or in\r\ncommunicating with him through Provis, have the goodness to mention that\r\nthe particulars and vouchers of our long account shall be sent to you,\r\ntogether with the balance; for there is still a balance remaining. Good\r\nday, Pip!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe shook hands, and he looked hard at me as long as he could see me. I\r\nturned at the door, and he was still looking hard at me, while the two\r\nvile casts on the shelf seemed to be trying to get their eyelids open,\r\nand to force out of their swollen throats, \xe2\x80\x9cO, what a man he is!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWemmick was out, and though he had been at his desk he could have done\r\nnothing for me. I went straight back to the Temple, where I found\r\nthe terrible Provis drinking rum and water and smoking negro-head, in\r\nsafety.\r\n\r\nNext day the clothes I had ordered all came home, and he put them on.\r\nWhatever he put on, became him less (it dismally seemed to me) than what\r\nhe had worn before. To my thinking, there was something in him that made\r\nit hopeless to attempt to disguise him. The more I dressed him and the\r\nbetter I dressed him, the more he looked like the slouching fugitive on\r\nthe marshes. This effect on my anxious fancy was partly referable, no\r\ndoubt, to his old face and manner growing more familiar to me; but I\r\nbelieve too that he dragged one of his legs as if there were still a\r\nweight of iron on it, and that from head to foot there was Convict in\r\nthe very grain of the man.\r\n\r\nThe influences of his solitary hut-life were upon him besides, and\r\ngave him a savage air that no dress could tame; added to these were the\r\ninfluences of his subsequent branded life among men, and, crowning all,\r\nhis consciousness that he was dodging and hiding now. In all his ways of\r\nsitting and standing, and eating and drinking,--of brooding about in a\r\nhigh-shouldered reluctant style,--of taking out his great horn-handled\r\njackknife and wiping it on his legs and cutting his food,--of\r\nlifting light glasses and cups to his lips, as if they were clumsy\r\npannikins,--of chopping a wedge off his bread, and soaking up with it\r\nthe last fragments of gravy round and round his plate, as if to make the\r\nmost of an allowance, and then drying his finger-ends on it, and then\r\nswallowing it,--in these ways and a thousand other small nameless\r\ninstances arising every minute in the day, there was Prisoner, Felon,\r\nBondsman, plain as plain could be.\r\n\r\nIt had been his own idea to wear that touch of powder, and I had\r\nconceded the powder after overcoming the shorts. But I can compare the\r\neffect of it, when on, to nothing but the probable effect of rouge upon\r\nthe dead; so awful was the manner in which everything in him that it was\r\nmost desirable to repress, started through that thin layer of pretence,\r\nand seemed to come blazing out at the crown of his head. It was\r\nabandoned as soon as tried, and he wore his grizzled hair cut short.\r\n\r\nWords cannot tell what a sense I had, at the same time, of the dreadful\r\nmystery that he was to me. When he fell asleep of an evening, with his\r\nknotted hands clenching the sides of the easy-chair, and his bald head\r\ntattooed with deep wrinkles falling forward on his breast, I would sit\r\nand look at him, wondering what he had done, and loading him with all\r\nthe crimes in the Calendar, until the impulse was powerful on me to\r\nstart up and fly from him. Every hour so increased my abhorrence of\r\nhim, that I even think I might have yielded to this impulse in the first\r\nagonies of being so haunted, notwithstanding all he had done for me and\r\nthe risk he ran, but for the knowledge that Herbert must soon come back.\r\nOnce, I actually did start out of bed in the night, and begin to dress\r\nmyself in my worst clothes, hurriedly intending to leave him there with\r\neverything else I possessed, and enlist for India as a private soldier.\r\n\r\nI doubt if a ghost could have been more terrible to me, up in those\r\nlonely rooms in the long evenings and long nights, with the wind and the\r\nrain always rushing by. A ghost could not have been taken and hanged on\r\nmy account, and the consideration that he could be, and the dread that\r\nhe would be, were no small addition to my horrors. When he was not\r\nasleep, or playing a complicated kind of Patience with a ragged pack of\r\ncards of his own,--a game that I never saw before or since, and in which\r\nhe recorded his winnings by sticking his jackknife into the table,--when\r\nhe was not engaged in either of these pursuits, he would ask me to\r\nread to him,--\xe2\x80\x9cForeign language, dear boy!\xe2\x80\x9d While I complied, he, not\r\ncomprehending a single word, would stand before the fire surveying me\r\nwith the air of an Exhibitor, and I would see him, between the fingers\r\nof the hand with which I shaded my face, appealing in dumb show to\r\nthe furniture to take notice of my proficiency. The imaginary student\r\npursued by the misshapen creature he had impiously made, was not more\r\nwretched than I, pursued by the creature who had made me, and recoiling\r\nfrom him with a stronger repulsion, the more he admired me and the\r\nfonder he was of me.\r\n\r\nThis is written of, I am sensible, as if it had lasted a year. It lasted\r\nabout five days. Expecting Herbert all the time, I dared not go out,\r\nexcept when I took Provis for an airing after dark. At length, one\r\nevening when dinner was over and I had dropped into a slumber quite\r\nworn out,--for my nights had been agitated and my rest broken by fearful\r\ndreams,--I was roused by the welcome footstep on the staircase. Provis,\r\nwho had been asleep too, staggered up at the noise I made, and in an\r\ninstant I saw his jackknife shining in his hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuiet! It\xe2\x80\x99s Herbert!\xe2\x80\x9d I said; and Herbert came bursting in, with the\r\nairy freshness of six hundred miles of France upon him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHandel, my dear fellow, how are you, and again how are you, and again\r\nhow are you? I seem to have been gone a twelvemonth! Why, so I must have\r\nbeen, for you have grown quite thin and pale! Handel, my--Halloa! I beg\r\nyour pardon.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was stopped in his running on and in his shaking hands with me, by\r\nseeing Provis. Provis, regarding him with a fixed attention, was slowly\r\nputting up his jackknife, and groping in another pocket for something\r\nelse.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHerbert, my dear friend,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, shutting the double doors, while\r\nHerbert stood staring and wondering, \xe2\x80\x9csomething very strange has\r\nhappened. This is--a visitor of mine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s all right, dear boy!\xe2\x80\x9d said Provis coming forward, with his little\r\nclasped black book, and then addressing himself to Herbert. \xe2\x80\x9cTake it in\r\nyour right hand. Lord strike you dead on the spot, if ever you split in\r\nany way sumever! Kiss it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo so, as he wishes it,\xe2\x80\x9d I said to Herbert. So, Herbert, looking at\r\nme with a friendly uneasiness and amazement, complied, and Provis\r\nimmediately shaking hands with him, said, \xe2\x80\x9cNow you\xe2\x80\x99re on your oath, you\r\nknow. And never believe me on mine, if Pip shan\xe2\x80\x99t make a gentleman on\r\nyou!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XLI\r\n\r\nIn vain should I attempt to describe the astonishment and disquiet\r\nof Herbert, when he and I and Provis sat down before the fire, and I\r\nrecounted the whole of the secret. Enough, that I saw my own feelings\r\nreflected in Herbert\xe2\x80\x99s face, and not least among them, my repugnance\r\ntowards the man who had done so much for me.\r\n\r\nWhat would alone have set a division between that man and us, if there\r\nhad been no other dividing circumstance, was his triumph in my story.\r\nSaving his troublesome sense of having been \xe2\x80\x9clow\xe2\x80\x9d on one occasion since\r\nhis return,--on which point he began to hold forth to Herbert, the\r\nmoment my revelation was finished,--he had no perception of the\r\npossibility of my finding any fault with my good fortune. His boast that\r\nhe had made me a gentleman, and that he had come to see me support the\r\ncharacter on his ample resources, was made for me quite as much as for\r\nhimself. And that it was a highly agreeable boast to both of us,\r\nand that we must both be very proud of it, was a conclusion quite\r\nestablished in his own mind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThough, look\xe2\x80\x99ee here, Pip\xe2\x80\x99s comrade,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to Herbert, after having\r\ndiscoursed for some time, \xe2\x80\x9cI know very well that once since I come\r\nback--for half a minute--I\xe2\x80\x99ve been low. I said to Pip, I knowed as I had\r\nbeen low. But don\xe2\x80\x99t you fret yourself on that score. I ain\xe2\x80\x99t made Pip a\r\ngentleman, and Pip ain\xe2\x80\x99t a going to make you a gentleman, not fur me not\r\nto know what\xe2\x80\x99s due to ye both. Dear boy, and Pip\xe2\x80\x99s comrade, you two may\r\ncount upon me always having a gen-teel muzzle on. Muzzled I have been\r\nsince that half a minute when I was betrayed into lowness, muzzled I am\r\nat the present time, muzzled I ever will be.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHerbert said, \xe2\x80\x9cCertainly,\xe2\x80\x9d but looked as if there were no specific\r\nconsolation in this, and remained perplexed and dismayed. We were\r\nanxious for the time when he would go to his lodging and leave us\r\ntogether, but he was evidently jealous of leaving us together, and sat\r\nlate. It was midnight before I took him round to Essex Street, and\r\nsaw him safely in at his own dark door. When it closed upon him, I\r\nexperienced the first moment of relief I had known since the night of\r\nhis arrival.\r\n\r\nNever quite free from an uneasy remembrance of the man on the stairs,\r\nI had always looked about me in taking my guest out after dark, and in\r\nbringing him back; and I looked about me now. Difficult as it is in a\r\nlarge city to avoid the suspicion of being watched, when the mind is\r\nconscious of danger in that regard, I could not persuade myself that any\r\nof the people within sight cared about my movements. The few who were\r\npassing passed on their several ways, and the street was empty when I\r\nturned back into the Temple. Nobody had come out at the gate with us,\r\nnobody went in at the gate with me. As I crossed by the fountain, I saw\r\nhis lighted back windows looking bright and quiet, and, when I stood for\r\na few moments in the doorway of the building where I lived, before going\r\nup the stairs, Garden Court was as still and lifeless as the staircase\r\nwas when I ascended it.\r\n\r\nHerbert received me with open arms, and I had never felt before so\r\nblessedly what it is to have a friend. When he had spoken some sound\r\nwords of sympathy and encouragement, we sat down to consider the\r\nquestion, What was to be done?\r\n\r\nThe chair that Provis had occupied still remaining where it had\r\nstood,--for he had a barrack way with him of hanging about one spot, in\r\none unsettled manner, and going through one round of observances with\r\nhis pipe and his negro-head and his jackknife and his pack of cards,\r\nand what not, as if it were all put down for him on a slate,--I say his\r\nchair remaining where it had stood, Herbert unconsciously took it, but\r\nnext moment started out of it, pushed it away, and took another. He had\r\nno occasion to say after that that he had conceived an aversion for my\r\npatron, neither had I occasion to confess my own. We interchanged that\r\nconfidence without shaping a syllable.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat,\xe2\x80\x9d said I to Herbert, when he was safe in another chair,--\xe2\x80\x9cwhat is\r\nto be done?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy poor dear Handel,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied, holding his head, \xe2\x80\x9cI am too stunned\r\nto think.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo was I, Herbert, when the blow first fell. Still, something must be\r\ndone. He is intent upon various new expenses,--horses, and carriages,\r\nand lavish appearances of all kinds. He must be stopped somehow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou mean that you can\xe2\x80\x99t accept--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow can I?\xe2\x80\x9d I interposed, as Herbert paused. \xe2\x80\x9cThink of him! Look at\r\nhim!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAn involuntary shudder passed over both of us.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYet I am afraid the dreadful truth is, Herbert, that he is attached to\r\nme, strongly attached to me. Was there ever such a fate!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy poor dear Handel,\xe2\x80\x9d Herbert repeated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cafter all, stopping short here, never taking another\r\npenny from him, think what I owe him already! Then again: I am heavily\r\nin debt,--very heavily for me, who have now no expectations,--and I have\r\nbeen bred to no calling, and I am fit for nothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, well, well!\xe2\x80\x9d Herbert remonstrated. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t say fit for nothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat am I fit for? I know only one thing that I am fit for, and that\r\nis, to go for a soldier. And I might have gone, my dear Herbert, but for\r\nthe prospect of taking counsel with your friendship and affection.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOf course I broke down there: and of course Herbert, beyond seizing a\r\nwarm grip of my hand, pretended not to know it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnyhow, my dear Handel,\xe2\x80\x9d said he presently, \xe2\x80\x9csoldiering won\xe2\x80\x99t do. If\r\nyou were to renounce this patronage and these favors, I suppose you\r\nwould do so with some faint hope of one day repaying what you have\r\nalready had. Not very strong, that hope, if you went soldiering!\r\nBesides, it\xe2\x80\x99s absurd. You would be infinitely better in Clarriker\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhouse, small as it is. I am working up towards a partnership, you know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPoor fellow! He little suspected with whose money.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut there is another question,\xe2\x80\x9d said Herbert. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is an ignorant,\r\ndetermined man, who has long had one fixed idea. More than that, he\r\nseems to me (I may misjudge him) to be a man of a desperate and fierce\r\ncharacter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know he is,\xe2\x80\x9d I returned. \xe2\x80\x9cLet me tell you what evidence I have seen\r\nof it.\xe2\x80\x9d And I told him what I had not mentioned in my narrative, of that\r\nencounter with the other convict.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSee, then,\xe2\x80\x9d said Herbert; \xe2\x80\x9cthink of this! He comes here at the peril\r\nof his life, for the realization of his fixed idea. In the moment of\r\nrealization, after all his toil and waiting, you cut the ground from\r\nunder his feet, destroy his idea, and make his gains worthless to him.\r\nDo you see nothing that he might do, under the disappointment?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have seen it, Herbert, and dreamed of it, ever since the fatal night\r\nof his arrival. Nothing has been in my thoughts so distinctly as his\r\nputting himself in the way of being taken.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you may rely upon it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Herbert, \xe2\x80\x9cthat there would be great\r\ndanger of his doing it. That is his power over you as long as he remains\r\nin England, and that would be his reckless course if you forsook him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI was so struck by the horror of this idea, which had weighed upon\r\nme from the first, and the working out of which would make me regard\r\nmyself, in some sort, as his murderer, that I could not rest in my\r\nchair, but began pacing to and fro. I said to Herbert, meanwhile, that\r\neven if Provis were recognized and taken, in spite of himself, I should\r\nbe wretched as the cause, however innocently. Yes; even though I was so\r\nwretched in having him at large and near me, and even though I would\r\nfar rather have worked at the forge all the days of my life than I would\r\never have come to this!\r\n\r\nBut there was no staving off the question, What was to be done?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe first and the main thing to be done,\xe2\x80\x9d said Herbert, \xe2\x80\x9cis to get him\r\nout of England. You will have to go with him, and then he may be induced\r\nto go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut get him where I will, could I prevent his coming back?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy good Handel, is it not obvious that with Newgate in the next street,\r\nthere must be far greater hazard in your breaking your mind to him and\r\nmaking him reckless, here, than elsewhere? If a pretext to get him away\r\ncould be made out of that other convict, or out of anything else in his\r\nlife, now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere, again!\xe2\x80\x9d said I, stopping before Herbert, with my open hands held\r\nout, as if they contained the desperation of the case. \xe2\x80\x9cI know nothing\r\nof his life. It has almost made me mad to sit here of a night and see\r\nhim before me, so bound up with my fortunes and misfortunes, and yet so\r\nunknown to me, except as the miserable wretch who terrified me two days\r\nin my childhood!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHerbert got up, and linked his arm in mine, and we slowly walked to and\r\nfro together, studying the carpet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHandel,\xe2\x80\x9d said Herbert, stopping, \xe2\x80\x9cyou feel convinced that you can take\r\nno further benefits from him; do you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFully. Surely you would, too, if you were in my place?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you feel convinced that you must break with him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHerbert, can you ask me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you have, and are bound to have, that tenderness for the life he\r\nhas risked on your account, that you must save him, if possible, from\r\nthrowing it away. Then you must get him out of England before you stir a\r\nfinger to extricate yourself. That done, extricate yourself, in Heaven\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nname, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll see it out together, dear old boy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was a comfort to shake hands upon it, and walk up and down again,\r\nwith only that done.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, Herbert,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cwith reference to gaining some knowledge of\r\nhis history. There is but one way that I know of. I must ask him point\r\nblank.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. Ask him,\xe2\x80\x9d said Herbert, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen we sit at breakfast in the morning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n For he had said, on taking leave of Herbert, that he would come to\r\nbreakfast with us.\r\n\r\nWith this project formed, we went to bed. I had the wildest dreams\r\nconcerning him, and woke unrefreshed; I woke, too, to recover the fear\r\nwhich I had lost in the night, of his being found out as a returned\r\ntransport. Waking, I never lost that fear.\r\n\r\nHe came round at the appointed time, took out his jackknife, and sat\r\ndown to his meal. He was full of plans \xe2\x80\x9cfor his gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s coming out\r\nstrong, and like a gentleman,\xe2\x80\x9d and urged me to begin speedily upon\r\nthe pocket-book which he had left in my possession. He considered the\r\nchambers and his own lodging as temporary residences, and advised me to\r\nlook out at once for a \xe2\x80\x9cfashionable crib\xe2\x80\x9d near Hyde Park, in which he\r\ncould have \xe2\x80\x9ca shake-down.\xe2\x80\x9d When he had made an end of his breakfast,\r\nand was wiping his knife on his leg, I said to him, without a word of\r\npreface,--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfter you were gone last night, I told my friend of the struggle that\r\nthe soldiers found you engaged in on the marshes, when we came up. You\r\nremember?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRemember!\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cI think so!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe want to know something about that man--and about you. It is strange\r\nto know no more about either, and particularly you, than I was able to\r\ntell last night. Is not this as good a time as another for our knowing\r\nmore?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell!\xe2\x80\x9d he said, after consideration. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re on your oath, you know,\r\nPip\xe2\x80\x99s comrade?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAssuredly,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Herbert.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs to anything I say, you know,\xe2\x80\x9d he insisted. \xe2\x80\x9cThe oath applies to\r\nall.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI understand it to do so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd look\xe2\x80\x99ee here! Wotever I done is worked out and paid for,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\ninsisted again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo be it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe took out his black pipe and was going to fill it with negro-head,\r\nwhen, looking at the tangle of tobacco in his hand, he seemed to think\r\nit might perplex the thread of his narrative. He put it back again,\r\nstuck his pipe in a button-hole of his coat, spread a hand on each knee,\r\nand after turning an angry eye on the fire for a few silent moments,\r\nlooked round at us and said what follows.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XLII\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear boy and Pip\xe2\x80\x99s comrade. I am not a going fur to tell you my life\r\nlike a song, or a story-book. But to give it you short and handy, I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nput it at once into a mouthful of English. In jail and out of jail, in\r\njail and out of jail, in jail and out of jail. There, you\xe2\x80\x99ve got it.\r\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s my life pretty much, down to such times as I got shipped off,\r\narter Pip stood my friend.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve been done everything to, pretty well--except hanged. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been\r\nlocked up as much as a silver tea-kittle. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been carted here and\r\ncarted there, and put out of this town, and put out of that town, and\r\nstuck in the stocks, and whipped and worried and drove. I\xe2\x80\x99ve no more\r\nnotion where I was born than you have--if so much. I first become aware\r\nof myself down in Essex, a thieving turnips for my living. Summun had\r\nrun away from me--a man--a tinker--and he\xe2\x80\x99d took the fire with him, and\r\nleft me wery cold.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know\xe2\x80\x99d my name to be Magwitch, chrisen\xe2\x80\x99d Abel. How did I know\r\nit? Much as I know\xe2\x80\x99d the birds\xe2\x80\x99 names in the hedges to be chaffinch,\r\nsparrer, thrush. I might have thought it was all lies together, only as\r\nthe birds\xe2\x80\x99 names come out true, I supposed mine did.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo fur as I could find, there warn\xe2\x80\x99t a soul that see young Abel\r\nMagwitch, with us little on him as in him, but wot caught fright at him,\r\nand either drove him off, or took him up. I was took up, took up, took\r\nup, to that extent that I reg\xe2\x80\x99larly grow\xe2\x80\x99d up took up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is the way it was, that when I was a ragged little creetur as much\r\nto be pitied as ever I see (not that I looked in the glass, for there\r\nwarn\xe2\x80\x99t many insides of furnished houses known to me), I got the name of\r\nbeing hardened. \xe2\x80\x98This is a terrible hardened one,\xe2\x80\x99 they says to prison\r\nwisitors, picking out me. \xe2\x80\x98May be said to live in jails, this boy.\xe2\x80\x99 Then\r\nthey looked at me, and I looked at them, and they measured my head, some\r\non \xe2\x80\x98em,--they had better a measured my stomach,--and others on \xe2\x80\x98em giv\r\nme tracts what I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t read, and made me speeches what I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nunderstand. They always went on agen me about the Devil. But what\r\nthe Devil was I to do? I must put something into my stomach, mustn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nI?--Howsomever, I\xe2\x80\x99m a getting low, and I know what\xe2\x80\x99s due. Dear boy and\r\nPip\xe2\x80\x99s comrade, don\xe2\x80\x99t you be afeerd of me being low.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTramping, begging, thieving, working sometimes when I could,--though\r\nthat warn\xe2\x80\x99t as often as you may think, till you put the question whether\r\nyou would ha\xe2\x80\x99 been over-ready to give me work yourselves,--a bit of a\r\npoacher, a bit of a laborer, a bit of a wagoner, a bit of a haymaker,\r\na bit of a hawker, a bit of most things that don\xe2\x80\x99t pay and lead to\r\ntrouble, I got to be a man. A deserting soldier in a Traveller\xe2\x80\x99s Rest,\r\nwhat lay hid up to the chin under a lot of taturs, learnt me to read;\r\nand a travelling Giant what signed his name at a penny a time learnt me\r\nto write. I warn\xe2\x80\x99t locked up as often now as formerly, but I wore out my\r\ngood share of key-metal still.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt Epsom races, a matter of over twenty years ago, I got acquainted wi\xe2\x80\x99\r\na man whose skull I\xe2\x80\x99d crack wi\xe2\x80\x99 this poker, like the claw of a lobster,\r\nif I\xe2\x80\x99d got it on this hob. His right name was Compeyson; and that\xe2\x80\x99s the\r\nman, dear boy, what you see me a pounding in the ditch, according to\r\nwhat you truly told your comrade arter I was gone last night.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe set up fur a gentleman, this Compeyson, and he\xe2\x80\x99d been to a public\r\nboarding-school and had learning. He was a smooth one to talk, and was\r\na dab at the ways of gentlefolks. He was good-looking too. It was the\r\nnight afore the great race, when I found him on the heath, in a booth\r\nthat I know\xe2\x80\x99d on. Him and some more was a sitting among the tables when\r\nI went in, and the landlord (which had a knowledge of me, and was a\r\nsporting one) called him out, and said, \xe2\x80\x98I think this is a man that\r\nmight suit you,\xe2\x80\x99--meaning I was.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCompeyson, he looks at me very noticing, and I look at him. He has a\r\nwatch and a chain and a ring and a breast-pin and a handsome suit of\r\nclothes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98To judge from appearances, you\xe2\x80\x99re out of luck,\xe2\x80\x99 says Compeyson to me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Yes, master, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve never been in it much.\xe2\x80\x99 (I had come out of\r\nKingston Jail last on a vagrancy committal. Not but what it might have\r\nbeen for something else; but it warn\xe2\x80\x99t.)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Luck changes,\xe2\x80\x99 says Compeyson; \xe2\x80\x98perhaps yours is going to change.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI says, \xe2\x80\x98I hope it may be so. There\xe2\x80\x99s room.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98What can you do?\xe2\x80\x99 says Compeyson.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Eat and drink,\xe2\x80\x99 I says; \xe2\x80\x98if you\xe2\x80\x99ll find the materials.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCompeyson laughed, looked at me again very noticing, giv me five\r\nshillings, and appointed me for next night. Same place.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI went to Compeyson next night, same place, and Compeyson took me on\r\nto be his man and pardner. And what was Compeyson\xe2\x80\x99s business in which we\r\nwas to go pardners? Compeyson\xe2\x80\x99s business was the swindling, handwriting\r\nforging, stolen bank-note passing, and such-like. All sorts of traps as\r\nCompeyson could set with his head, and keep his own legs out of and get\r\nthe profits from and let another man in for, was Compeyson\xe2\x80\x99s business.\r\nHe\xe2\x80\x99d no more heart than a iron file, he was as cold as death, and he had\r\nthe head of the Devil afore mentioned.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere was another in with Compeyson, as was called Arthur,--not as\r\nbeing so chrisen\xe2\x80\x99d, but as a surname. He was in a Decline, and was a\r\nshadow to look at. Him and Compeyson had been in a bad thing with a\r\nrich lady some years afore, and they\xe2\x80\x99d made a pot of money by it; but\r\nCompeyson betted and gamed, and he\xe2\x80\x99d have run through the king\xe2\x80\x99s taxes.\r\nSo, Arthur was a dying, and a dying poor and with the horrors on him,\r\nand Compeyson\xe2\x80\x99s wife (which Compeyson kicked mostly) was a having pity\r\non him when she could, and Compeyson was a having pity on nothing and\r\nnobody.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI might a took warning by Arthur, but I didn\xe2\x80\x99t; and I won\xe2\x80\x99t pretend I\r\nwas partick\xe2\x80\x99ler--for where \xe2\x80\x98ud be the good on it, dear boy and comrade?\r\nSo I begun wi\xe2\x80\x99 Compeyson, and a poor tool I was in his hands. Arthur\r\nlived at the top of Compeyson\xe2\x80\x99s house (over nigh Brentford it was), and\r\nCompeyson kept a careful account agen him for board and lodging, in case\r\nhe should ever get better to work it out. But Arthur soon settled the\r\naccount. The second or third time as ever I see him, he come a tearing\r\ndown into Compeyson\xe2\x80\x99s parlor late at night, in only a flannel gown, with\r\nhis hair all in a sweat, and he says to Compeyson\xe2\x80\x99s wife, \xe2\x80\x98Sally, she\r\nreally is upstairs alonger me, now, and I can\xe2\x80\x99t get rid of her. She\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nall in white,\xe2\x80\x99 he says, \xe2\x80\x98wi\xe2\x80\x99 white flowers in her hair, and she\xe2\x80\x99s awful\r\nmad, and she\xe2\x80\x99s got a shroud hanging over her arm, and she says she\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nput it on me at five in the morning.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSays Compeyson: \xe2\x80\x98Why, you fool, don\xe2\x80\x99t you know she\xe2\x80\x99s got a living body?\r\nAnd how should she be up there, without coming through the door, or in\r\nat the window, and up the stairs?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how she\xe2\x80\x99s there,\xe2\x80\x99 says Arthur, shivering dreadful with\r\nthe horrors, \xe2\x80\x98but she\xe2\x80\x99s standing in the corner at the foot of the bed,\r\nawful mad. And over where her heart\xe2\x80\x99s broke--you broke it!--there\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndrops of blood.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCompeyson spoke hardy, but he was always a coward. \xe2\x80\x98Go up alonger this\r\ndrivelling sick man,\xe2\x80\x99 he says to his wife, \xe2\x80\x98and Magwitch, lend her a\r\nhand, will you?\xe2\x80\x99 But he never come nigh himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCompeyson\xe2\x80\x99s wife and me took him up to bed agen, and he raved most\r\ndreadful. \xe2\x80\x98Why look at her!\xe2\x80\x99 he cries out. \xe2\x80\x98She\xe2\x80\x99s a shaking the shroud\r\nat me! Don\xe2\x80\x99t you see her? Look at her eyes! Ain\xe2\x80\x99t it awful to see her so\r\nmad?\xe2\x80\x99 Next he cries, \xe2\x80\x98She\xe2\x80\x99ll put it on me, and then I\xe2\x80\x99m done for! Take\r\nit away from her, take it away!\xe2\x80\x99 And then he catched hold of us, and kep\r\non a talking to her, and answering of her, till I half believed I see\r\nher myself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCompeyson\xe2\x80\x99s wife, being used to him, giv him some liquor to get the\r\nhorrors off, and by and by he quieted. \xe2\x80\x98O, she\xe2\x80\x99s gone! Has her keeper\r\nbeen for her?\xe2\x80\x99 he says. \xe2\x80\x98Yes,\xe2\x80\x99 says Compeyson\xe2\x80\x99s wife. \xe2\x80\x98Did you tell him\r\nto lock her and bar her in?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Yes.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98And to take that ugly thing away\r\nfrom her?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Yes, yes, all right.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98You\xe2\x80\x99re a good creetur,\xe2\x80\x99 he says,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98don\xe2\x80\x99t leave me, whatever you do, and thank you!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe rested pretty quiet till it might want a few minutes of five, and\r\nthen he starts up with a scream, and screams out, \xe2\x80\x98Here she is! She\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngot the shroud again. She\xe2\x80\x99s unfolding it. She\xe2\x80\x99s coming out of the\r\ncorner. She\xe2\x80\x99s coming to the bed. Hold me, both on you--one of each\r\nside--don\xe2\x80\x99t let her touch me with it. Hah! she missed me that time.\r\nDon\xe2\x80\x99t let her throw it over my shoulders. Don\xe2\x80\x99t let her lift me up to\r\nget it round me. She\xe2\x80\x99s lifting me up. Keep me down!\xe2\x80\x99 Then he lifted\r\nhimself up hard, and was dead.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCompeyson took it easy as a good riddance for both sides. Him and\r\nme was soon busy, and first he swore me (being ever artful) on my own\r\nbook,--this here little black book, dear boy, what I swore your comrade\r\non.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot to go into the things that Compeyson planned, and I done--which \xe2\x80\x98ud\r\ntake a week--I\xe2\x80\x99ll simply say to you, dear boy, and Pip\xe2\x80\x99s comrade, that\r\nthat man got me into such nets as made me his black slave. I was always\r\nin debt to him, always under his thumb, always a working, always a\r\ngetting into danger. He was younger than me, but he\xe2\x80\x99d got craft, and\r\nhe\xe2\x80\x99d got learning, and he overmatched me five hundred times told and\r\nno mercy. My Missis as I had the hard time wi\xe2\x80\x99--Stop though! I ain\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nbrought her in--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe looked about him in a confused way, as if he had lost his place in\r\nthe book of his remembrance; and he turned his face to the fire, and\r\nspread his hands broader on his knees, and lifted them off and put them\r\non again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere ain\xe2\x80\x99t no need to go into it,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, looking round once more.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe time wi\xe2\x80\x99 Compeyson was a\xe2\x80\x99most as hard a time as ever I had; that\r\nsaid, all\xe2\x80\x99s said. Did I tell you as I was tried, alone, for misdemeanor,\r\nwhile with Compeyson?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI answered, No.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell!\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cI was, and got convicted. As to took up on suspicion,\r\nthat was twice or three times in the four or five year that it lasted;\r\nbut evidence was wanting. At last, me and Compeyson was both committed\r\nfor felony,--on a charge of putting stolen notes in circulation,--and\r\nthere was other charges behind. Compeyson says to me, \xe2\x80\x98Separate\r\ndefences, no communication,\xe2\x80\x99 and that was all. And I was so miserable\r\npoor, that I sold all the clothes I had, except what hung on my back,\r\nafore I could get Jaggers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen we was put in the dock, I noticed first of all what a gentleman\r\nCompeyson looked, wi\xe2\x80\x99 his curly hair and his black clothes and his white\r\npocket-handkercher, and what a common sort of a wretch I looked. When\r\nthe prosecution opened and the evidence was put short, aforehand, I\r\nnoticed how heavy it all bore on me, and how light on him. When the\r\nevidence was giv in the box, I noticed how it was always me that had\r\ncome for\xe2\x80\x99ard, and could be swore to, how it was always me that the money\r\nhad been paid to, how it was always me that had seemed to work the thing\r\nand get the profit. But when the defence come on, then I see the plan\r\nplainer; for, says the counsellor for Compeyson, \xe2\x80\x98My lord and gentlemen,\r\nhere you has afore you, side by side, two persons as your eyes can\r\nseparate wide; one, the younger, well brought up, who will be spoke to\r\nas such; one, the elder, ill brought up, who will be spoke to as such;\r\none, the younger, seldom if ever seen in these here transactions, and\r\nonly suspected; t\xe2\x80\x99other, the elder, always seen in \xe2\x80\x98em and always wi\xe2\x80\x99 his\r\nguilt brought home. Can you doubt, if there is but one in it, which is\r\nthe one, and, if there is two in it, which is much the worst one?\xe2\x80\x99 And\r\nsuch-like. And when it come to character, warn\xe2\x80\x99t it Compeyson as had\r\nbeen to the school, and warn\xe2\x80\x99t it his schoolfellows as was in this\r\nposition and in that, and warn\xe2\x80\x99t it him as had been know\xe2\x80\x99d by witnesses\r\nin such clubs and societies, and nowt to his disadvantage? And warn\xe2\x80\x99t it\r\nme as had been tried afore, and as had been know\xe2\x80\x99d up hill and down dale\r\nin Bridewells and Lock-Ups! And when it come to speech-making, warn\xe2\x80\x99t it\r\nCompeyson as could speak to \xe2\x80\x98em wi\xe2\x80\x99 his face dropping every now and then\r\ninto his white pocket-handkercher,--ah! and wi\xe2\x80\x99 verses in his speech,\r\ntoo,--and warn\xe2\x80\x99t it me as could only say, \xe2\x80\x98Gentlemen, this man at my\r\nside is a most precious rascal\xe2\x80\x99? And when the verdict come, warn\xe2\x80\x99t it\r\nCompeyson as was recommended to mercy on account of good character and\r\nbad company, and giving up all the information he could agen me,\r\nand warn\xe2\x80\x99t it me as got never a word but Guilty? And when I says to\r\nCompeyson, \xe2\x80\x98Once out of this court, I\xe2\x80\x99ll smash that face of yourn!\xe2\x80\x99\r\nain\xe2\x80\x99t it Compeyson as prays the Judge to be protected, and gets two\r\nturnkeys stood betwixt us? And when we\xe2\x80\x99re sentenced, ain\xe2\x80\x99t it him as\r\ngets seven year, and me fourteen, and ain\xe2\x80\x99t it him as the Judge is\r\nsorry for, because he might a done so well, and ain\xe2\x80\x99t it me as the Judge\r\nperceives to be a old offender of wiolent passion, likely to come to\r\nworse?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had worked himself into a state of great excitement, but he checked\r\nit, took two or three short breaths, swallowed as often, and stretching\r\nout his hand towards me said, in a reassuring manner, \xe2\x80\x9cI ain\xe2\x80\x99t a going\r\nto be low, dear boy!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had so heated himself that he took out his handkerchief and wiped his\r\nface and head and neck and hands, before he could go on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had said to Compeyson that I\xe2\x80\x99d smash that face of his, and I swore\r\nLord smash mine! to do it. We was in the same prison-ship, but I\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t get at him for long, though I tried. At last I come behind him\r\nand hit him on the cheek to turn him round and get a smashing one at\r\nhim, when I was seen and seized. The black-hole of that ship warn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\na strong one, to a judge of black-holes that could swim and dive. I\r\nescaped to the shore, and I was a hiding among the graves there, envying\r\nthem as was in \xe2\x80\x98em and all over, when I first see my boy!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe regarded me with a look of affection that made him almost abhorrent\r\nto me again, though I had felt great pity for him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy my boy, I was giv to understand as Compeyson was out on them marshes\r\ntoo. Upon my soul, I half believe he escaped in his terror, to get quit\r\nof me, not knowing it was me as had got ashore. I hunted him down. I\r\nsmashed his face. \xe2\x80\x98And now,\xe2\x80\x99 says I \xe2\x80\x98as the worst thing I can do, caring\r\nnothing for myself, I\xe2\x80\x99ll drag you back.\xe2\x80\x99 And I\xe2\x80\x99d have swum off, towing\r\nhim by the hair, if it had come to that, and I\xe2\x80\x99d a got him aboard\r\nwithout the soldiers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course he\xe2\x80\x99d much the best of it to the last,--his character was so\r\ngood. He had escaped when he was made half wild by me and my murderous\r\nintentions; and his punishment was light. I was put in irons, brought\r\nto trial again, and sent for life. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t stop for life, dear boy and\r\nPip\xe2\x80\x99s comrade, being here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe wiped himself again, as he had done before, and then slowly took\r\nhis tangle of tobacco from his pocket, and plucked his pipe from his\r\nbutton-hole, and slowly filled it, and began to smoke.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs he dead?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked, after a silence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs who dead, dear boy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCompeyson.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe hopes I am, if he\xe2\x80\x99s alive, you may be sure,\xe2\x80\x9d with a fierce look. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nnever heerd no more of him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHerbert had been writing with his pencil in the cover of a book. He\r\nsoftly pushed the book over to me, as Provis stood smoking with his eyes\r\non the fire, and I read in it:--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYoung Havisham\xe2\x80\x99s name was Arthur. Compeyson is the man who professed to\r\nbe Miss Havisham\xe2\x80\x99s lover.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI shut the book and nodded slightly to Herbert, and put the book by; but\r\nwe neither of us said anything, and both looked at Provis as he stood\r\nsmoking by the fire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XLIII\r\n\r\nWhy should I pause to ask how much of my shrinking from Provis might be\r\ntraced to Estella? Why should I loiter on my road, to compare the state\r\nof mind in which I had tried to rid myself of the stain of the prison\r\nbefore meeting her at the coach-office, with the state of mind in which\r\nI now reflected on the abyss between Estella in her pride and beauty,\r\nand the returned transport whom I harbored? The road would be none the\r\nsmoother for it, the end would be none the better for it, he would not\r\nbe helped, nor I extenuated.\r\n\r\nA new fear had been engendered in my mind by his narrative; or rather,\r\nhis narrative had given form and purpose to the fear that was already\r\nthere. If Compeyson were alive and should discover his return, I could\r\nhardly doubt the consequence. That Compeyson stood in mortal fear of\r\nhim, neither of the two could know much better than I; and that any\r\nsuch man as that man had been described to be would hesitate to release\r\nhimself for good from a dreaded enemy by the safe means of becoming an\r\ninformer was scarcely to be imagined.\r\n\r\nNever had I breathed, and never would I breathe--or so I resolved--a\r\nword of Estella to Provis. But, I said to Herbert that, before I could\r\ngo abroad, I must see both Estella and Miss Havisham. This was when we\r\nwere left alone on the night of the day when Provis told us his story. I\r\nresolved to go out to Richmond next day, and I went.\r\n\r\nOn my presenting myself at Mrs. Brandley\xe2\x80\x99s, Estella\xe2\x80\x99s maid was called to\r\ntell that Estella had gone into the country. Where? To Satis House, as\r\nusual. Not as usual, I said, for she had never yet gone there without\r\nme; when was she coming back? There was an air of reservation in the\r\nanswer which increased my perplexity, and the answer was, that her maid\r\nbelieved she was only coming back at all for a little while. I could\r\nmake nothing of this, except that it was meant that I should make\r\nnothing of it, and I went home again in complete discomfiture.\r\n\r\nAnother night consultation with Herbert after Provis was gone home (I\r\nalways took him home, and always looked well about me), led us to the\r\nconclusion that nothing should be said about going abroad until I came\r\nback from Miss Havisham\xe2\x80\x99s. In the mean time, Herbert and I were to\r\nconsider separately what it would be best to say; whether we should\r\ndevise any pretence of being afraid that he was under suspicious\r\nobservation; or whether I, who had never yet been abroad, should propose\r\nan expedition. We both knew that I had but to propose anything, and he\r\nwould consent. We agreed that his remaining many days in his present\r\nhazard was not to be thought of.\r\n\r\nNext day I had the meanness to feign that I was under a binding promise\r\nto go down to Joe; but I was capable of almost any meanness towards Joe\r\nor his name. Provis was to be strictly careful while I was gone, and\r\nHerbert was to take the charge of him that I had taken. I was to be\r\nabsent only one night, and, on my return, the gratification of his\r\nimpatience for my starting as a gentleman on a greater scale was to\r\nbe begun. It occurred to me then, and as I afterwards found to\r\nHerbert also, that he might be best got away across the water, on that\r\npretence,--as, to make purchases, or the like.\r\n\r\nHaving thus cleared the way for my expedition to Miss Havisham\xe2\x80\x99s, I set\r\noff by the early morning coach before it was yet light, and was out\r\non the open country road when the day came creeping on, halting and\r\nwhimpering and shivering, and wrapped in patches of cloud and rags of\r\nmist, like a beggar. When we drove up to the Blue Boar after a drizzly\r\nride, whom should I see come out under the gateway, toothpick in hand,\r\nto look at the coach, but Bentley Drummle!\r\n\r\nAs he pretended not to see me, I pretended not to see him. It was a very\r\nlame pretence on both sides; the lamer, because we both went into the\r\ncoffee-room, where he had just finished his breakfast, and where I\r\nordered mine. It was poisonous to me to see him in the town, for I very\r\nwell knew why he had come there.\r\n\r\nPretending to read a smeary newspaper long out of date, which had\r\nnothing half so legible in its local news, as the foreign matter of\r\ncoffee, pickles, fish sauces, gravy, melted butter, and wine with which\r\nit was sprinkled all over, as if it had taken the measles in a highly\r\nirregular form, I sat at my table while he stood before the fire. By\r\ndegrees it became an enormous injury to me that he stood before the\r\nfire. And I got up, determined to have my share of it. I had to put my\r\nhand behind his legs for the poker when I went up to the fireplace to\r\nstir the fire, but still pretended not to know him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs this a cut?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Drummle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d said I, poker in hand; \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s you, is it? How do you do? I was\r\nwondering who it was, who kept the fire off.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith that, I poked tremendously, and having done so, planted myself side\r\nby side with Mr. Drummle, my shoulders squared and my back to the fire.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have just come down?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Drummle, edging me a little away\r\nwith his shoulder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, edging him a little away with my shoulder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBeastly place,\xe2\x80\x9d said Drummle. \xe2\x80\x9cYour part of the country, I think?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d I assented. \xe2\x80\x9cI am told it\xe2\x80\x99s very like your Shropshire.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot in the least like it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Drummle.\r\n\r\nHere Mr. Drummle looked at his boots and I looked at mine, and then Mr.\r\nDrummle looked at my boots, and I looked at his.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you been here long?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked, determined not to yield an inch of\r\nthe fire.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLong enough to be tired of it,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Drummle, pretending to yawn,\r\nbut equally determined.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you stay here long?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan\xe2\x80\x99t say,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Mr. Drummle. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan\xe2\x80\x99t say,\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\nI felt here, through a tingling in my blood, that if Mr. Drummle\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nshoulder had claimed another hair\xe2\x80\x99s breadth of room, I should have\r\njerked him into the window; equally, that if my own shoulder had urged a\r\nsimilar claim, Mr. Drummle would have jerked me into the nearest box. He\r\nwhistled a little. So did I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLarge tract of marshes about here, I believe?\xe2\x80\x9d said Drummle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. What of that?\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\nMr. Drummle looked at me, and then at my boots, and then said, \xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d and\r\nlaughed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you amused, Mr. Drummle?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cnot particularly. I am going out for a ride in the\r\nsaddle. I mean to explore those marshes for amusement. Out-of-the-way\r\nvillages there, they tell me. Curious little public-houses--and\r\nsmithies--and that. Waiter!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs that horse of mine ready?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBrought round to the door, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI say. Look here, you sir. The lady won\xe2\x80\x99t ride to-day; the weather\r\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery good, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I don\xe2\x80\x99t dine, because I\xe2\x80\x99m going to dine at the lady\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cVery good, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThen, Drummle glanced at me, with an insolent triumph on his\r\ngreat-jowled face that cut me to the heart, dull as he was, and so\r\nexasperated me, that I felt inclined to take him in my arms (as the\r\nrobber in the story-book is said to have taken the old lady) and seat\r\nhim on the fire.\r\n\r\nOne thing was manifest to both of us, and that was, that until relief\r\ncame, neither of us could relinquish the fire. There we stood, well\r\nsquared up before it, shoulder to shoulder and foot to foot, with our\r\nhands behind us, not budging an inch. The horse was visible outside in\r\nthe drizzle at the door, my breakfast was put on the table, Drummle\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwas cleared away, the waiter invited me to begin, I nodded, we both\r\nstood our ground.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you been to the Grove since?\xe2\x80\x9d said Drummle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cI had quite enough of the Finches the last time I was\r\nthere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWas that when we had a difference of opinion?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d I replied, very shortly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCome, come! They let you off easily enough,\xe2\x80\x9d sneered Drummle. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\nshouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have lost your temper.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Drummle,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cyou are not competent to give advice on that\r\nsubject. When I lose my temper (not that I admit having done so on that\r\noccasion), I don\xe2\x80\x99t throw glasses.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do,\xe2\x80\x9d said Drummle.\r\n\r\nAfter glancing at him once or twice, in an increased state of\r\nsmouldering ferocity, I said,--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Drummle, I did not seek this conversation, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it an\r\nagreeable one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am sure it\xe2\x80\x99s not,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, superciliously over his shoulder; \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t think anything about it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd therefore,\xe2\x80\x9d I went on, \xe2\x80\x9cwith your leave, I will suggest that we\r\nhold no kind of communication in future.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite my opinion,\xe2\x80\x9d said Drummle, \xe2\x80\x9cand what I should have suggested\r\nmyself, or done--more likely--without suggesting. But don\xe2\x80\x99t lose your\r\ntemper. Haven\xe2\x80\x99t you lost enough without that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWaiter!\xe2\x80\x9d said Drummle, by way of answering me.\r\n\r\nThe waiter reappeared.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook here, you sir. You quite understand that the young lady don\xe2\x80\x99t ride\r\nto-day, and that I dine at the young lady\xe2\x80\x99s?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite so, sir!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen the waiter had felt my fast-cooling teapot with the palm of his\r\nhand, and had looked imploringly at me, and had gone out, Drummle,\r\ncareful not to move the shoulder next me, took a cigar from his pocket\r\nand bit the end off, but showed no sign of stirring. Choking and\r\nboiling as I was, I felt that we could not go a word further, without\r\nintroducing Estella\xe2\x80\x99s name, which I could not endure to hear him utter;\r\nand therefore I looked stonily at the opposite wall, as if there were\r\nno one present, and forced myself to silence. How long we might have\r\nremained in this ridiculous position it is impossible to say, but\r\nfor the incursion of three thriving farmers--laid on by the waiter, I\r\nthink--who came into the coffee-room unbuttoning their great-coats and\r\nrubbing their hands, and before whom, as they charged at the fire, we\r\nwere obliged to give way.\r\n\r\nI saw him through the window, seizing his horse\xe2\x80\x99s mane, and mounting in\r\nhis blundering brutal manner, and sidling and backing away. I thought\r\nhe was gone, when he came back, calling for a light for the cigar in his\r\nmouth, which he had forgotten. A man in a dust-colored dress appeared\r\nwith what was wanted,--I could not have said from where: whether from\r\nthe inn yard, or the street, or where not,--and as Drummle leaned down\r\nfrom the saddle and lighted his cigar and laughed, with a jerk of his\r\nhead towards the coffee-room windows, the slouching shoulders and ragged\r\nhair of this man whose back was towards me reminded me of Orlick.\r\n\r\nToo heavily out of sorts to care much at the time whether it were he or\r\nno, or after all to touch the breakfast, I washed the weather and the\r\njourney from my face and hands, and went out to the memorable old house\r\nthat it would have been so much the better for me never to have entered,\r\nnever to have seen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XLIV\r\n\r\nIn the room where the dressing-table stood, and where the wax-candles\r\nburnt on the wall, I found Miss Havisham and Estella; Miss Havisham\r\nseated on a settee near the fire, and Estella on a cushion at her feet.\r\nEstella was knitting, and Miss Havisham was looking on. They both raised\r\ntheir eyes as I went in, and both saw an alteration in me. I derived\r\nthat, from the look they interchanged.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what wind,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Havisham, \xe2\x80\x9cblows you here, Pip?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThough she looked steadily at me, I saw that she was rather confused.\r\nEstella, pausing a moment in her knitting with her eyes upon me, and\r\nthen going on, I fancied that I read in the action of her fingers, as\r\nplainly as if she had told me in the dumb alphabet, that she perceived I\r\nhad discovered my real benefactor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Havisham,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cI went to Richmond yesterday, to speak to\r\nEstella; and finding that some wind had blown her here, I followed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Havisham motioning to me for the third or fourth time to sit down,\r\nI took the chair by the dressing-table, which I had often seen her\r\noccupy. With all that ruin at my feet and about me, it seemed a natural\r\nplace for me, that day.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat I had to say to Estella, Miss Havisham, I will say before you,\r\npresently--in a few moments. It will not surprise you, it will not\r\ndisplease you. I am as unhappy as you can ever have meant me to be.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMiss Havisham continued to look steadily at me. I could see in the\r\naction of Estella\xe2\x80\x99s fingers as they worked that she attended to what I\r\nsaid; but she did not look up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have found out who my patron is. It is not a fortunate discovery,\r\nand is not likely ever to enrich me in reputation, station, fortune,\r\nanything. There are reasons why I must say no more of that. It is not my\r\nsecret, but another\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs I was silent for a while, looking at Estella and considering how to\r\ngo on, Miss Havisham repeated, \xe2\x80\x9cIt is not your secret, but another\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\nWell?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen you first caused me to be brought here, Miss Havisham, when I\r\nbelonged to the village over yonder, that I wish I had never left,\r\nI suppose I did really come here, as any other chance boy might have\r\ncome,--as a kind of servant, to gratify a want or a whim, and to be paid\r\nfor it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, Pip,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Miss Havisham, steadily nodding her head; \xe2\x80\x9cyou did.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd that Mr. Jaggers--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Jaggers,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Havisham, taking me up in a firm tone, \xe2\x80\x9chad\r\nnothing to do with it, and knew nothing of it. His being my lawyer, and\r\nhis being the lawyer of your patron is a coincidence. He holds the same\r\nrelation towards numbers of people, and it might easily arise. Be that\r\nas it may, it did arise, and was not brought about by any one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAny one might have seen in her haggard face that there was no\r\nsuppression or evasion so far.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut when I fell into the mistake I have so long remained in, at least\r\nyou led me on?\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d she returned, again nodding steadily, \xe2\x80\x9cI let you go on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWas that kind?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho am I,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Miss Havisham, striking her stick upon the floor\r\nand flashing into wrath so suddenly that Estella glanced up at her in\r\nsurprise,--\xe2\x80\x9cwho am I, for God\xe2\x80\x99s sake, that I should be kind?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was a weak complaint to have made, and I had not meant to make it. I\r\ntold her so, as she sat brooding after this outburst.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, well, well!\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat else?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was liberally paid for my old attendance here,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, to soothe\r\nher, \xe2\x80\x9cin being apprenticed, and I have asked these questions only for\r\nmy own information. What follows has another (and I hope more\r\ndisinterested) purpose. In humoring my mistake, Miss Havisham, you\r\npunished--practised on--perhaps you will supply whatever term expresses\r\nyour intention, without offence--your self-seeking relations?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did. Why, they would have it so! So would you. What has been my\r\nhistory, that I should be at the pains of entreating either them or you\r\nnot to have it so! You made your own snares. I never made them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWaiting until she was quiet again,--for this, too, flashed out of her in\r\na wild and sudden way,--I went on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have been thrown among one family of your relations, Miss Havisham,\r\nand have been constantly among them since I went to London. I know them\r\nto have been as honestly under my delusion as I myself. And I should be\r\nfalse and base if I did not tell you, whether it is acceptable to you or\r\nno, and whether you are inclined to give credence to it or no, that you\r\ndeeply wrong both Mr. Matthew Pocket and his son Herbert, if you suppose\r\nthem to be otherwise than generous, upright, open, and incapable of\r\nanything designing or mean.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are your friends,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miss Havisham.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey made themselves my friends,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen they supposed me\r\nto have superseded them; and when Sarah Pocket, Miss Georgiana, and\r\nMistress Camilla were not my friends, I think.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis contrasting of them with the rest seemed, I was glad to see, to do\r\nthem good with her. She looked at me keenly for a little while, and then\r\nsaid quietly,--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you want for them?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnly,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you would not confound them with the others. They\r\nmay be of the same blood, but, believe me, they are not of the same\r\nnature.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStill looking at me keenly, Miss Havisham repeated,--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you want for them?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not so cunning, you see,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, in answer, conscious that I\r\nreddened a little, \xe2\x80\x9cas that I could hide from you, even if I desired,\r\nthat I do want something. Miss Havisham, if you would spare the money\r\nto do my friend Herbert a lasting service in life, but which from the\r\nnature of the case must be done without his knowledge, I could show you\r\nhow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy must it be done without his knowledge?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, settling her\r\nhands upon her stick, that she might regard me the more attentively.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cI began the service myself, more than two years ago,\r\nwithout his knowledge, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to be betrayed. Why I fail in my\r\nability to finish it, I cannot explain. It is a part of the secret which\r\nis another person\xe2\x80\x99s and not mine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe gradually withdrew her eyes from me, and turned them on the fire.\r\nAfter watching it for what appeared in the silence and by the light\r\nof the slowly wasting candles to be a long time, she was roused by\r\nthe collapse of some of the red coals, and looked towards me again--at\r\nfirst, vacantly--then, with a gradually concentrating attention. All\r\nthis time Estella knitted on. When Miss Havisham had fixed her\r\nattention on me, she said, speaking as if there had been no lapse in our\r\ndialogue,--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat else?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEstella,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, turning to her now, and trying to command my\r\ntrembling voice, \xe2\x80\x9cyou know I love you. You know that I have loved you\r\nlong and dearly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe raised her eyes to my face, on being thus addressed, and her fingers\r\nplied their work, and she looked at me with an unmoved countenance. I\r\nsaw that Miss Havisham glanced from me to her, and from her to me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should have said this sooner, but for my long mistake. It induced me\r\nto hope that Miss Havisham meant us for one another. While I thought you\r\ncould not help yourself, as it were, I refrained from saying it. But I\r\nmust say it now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPreserving her unmoved countenance, and with her fingers still going,\r\nEstella shook her head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, in answer to that action,--\xe2\x80\x9cI know. I have no hope\r\nthat I shall ever call you mine, Estella. I am ignorant what may become\r\nof me very soon, how poor I may be, or where I may go. Still, I love\r\nyou. I have loved you ever since I first saw you in this house.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nLooking at me perfectly unmoved and with her fingers busy, she shook her\r\nhead again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt would have been cruel in Miss Havisham, horribly cruel, to practise\r\non the susceptibility of a poor boy, and to torture me through all these\r\nyears with a vain hope and an idle pursuit, if she had reflected on the\r\ngravity of what she did. But I think she did not. I think that, in the\r\nendurance of her own trial, she forgot mine, Estella.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI saw Miss Havisham put her hand to her heart and hold it there, as she\r\nsat looking by turns at Estella and at me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt seems,\xe2\x80\x9d said Estella, very calmly, \xe2\x80\x9cthat there are sentiments,\r\nfancies,--I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how to call them,--which I am not able to\r\ncomprehend. When you say you love me, I know what you mean, as a form\r\nof words; but nothing more. You address nothing in my breast, you touch\r\nnothing there. I don\xe2\x80\x99t care for what you say at all. I have tried to\r\nwarn you of this; now, have I not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI said in a miserable manner, \xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. But you would not be warned, for you thought I did not mean it.\r\nNow, did you not think so?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought and hoped you could not mean it. You, so young, untried, and\r\nbeautiful, Estella! Surely it is not in Nature.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is in my nature,\xe2\x80\x9d she returned. And then she added, with a stress\r\nupon the words, \xe2\x80\x9cIt is in the nature formed within me. I make a great\r\ndifference between you and all other people when I say so much. I can do\r\nno more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it not true,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cthat Bentley Drummle is in town here, and\r\npursuing you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is quite true,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied, referring to him with the indifference\r\nof utter contempt.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat you encourage him, and ride out with him, and that he dines with\r\nyou this very day?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe seemed a little surprised that I should know it, but again replied,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite true.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou cannot love him, Estella!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHer fingers stopped for the first time, as she retorted rather angrily,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat have I told you? Do you still think, in spite of it, that I do not\r\nmean what I say?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou would never marry him, Estella?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe looked towards Miss Havisham, and considered for a moment with her\r\nwork in her hands. Then she said, \xe2\x80\x9cWhy not tell you the truth? I am\r\ngoing to be married to him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI dropped my face into my hands, but was able to control myself better\r\nthan I could have expected, considering what agony it gave me to hear\r\nher say those words. When I raised my face again, there was such a\r\nghastly look upon Miss Havisham\xe2\x80\x99s, that it impressed me, even in my\r\npassionate hurry and grief.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEstella, dearest Estella, do not let Miss Havisham lead you into this\r\nfatal step. Put me aside for ever,--you have done so, I well know,--but\r\nbestow yourself on some worthier person than Drummle. Miss Havisham\r\ngives you to him, as the greatest slight and injury that could be done\r\nto the many far better men who admire you, and to the few who truly\r\nlove you. Among those few there may be one who loves you even as dearly,\r\nthough he has not loved you as long, as I. Take him, and I can bear it\r\nbetter, for your sake!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMy earnestness awoke a wonder in her that seemed as if it would have\r\nbeen touched with compassion, if she could have rendered me at all\r\nintelligible to her own mind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am going,\xe2\x80\x9d she said again, in a gentler voice, \xe2\x80\x9cto be married to\r\nhim. The preparations for my marriage are making, and I shall be\r\nmarried soon. Why do you injuriously introduce the name of my mother by\r\nadoption? It is my own act.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour own act, Estella, to fling yourself away upon a brute?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn whom should I fling myself away?\xe2\x80\x9d she retorted, with a smile.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShould I fling myself away upon the man who would the soonest feel (if\r\npeople do feel such things) that I took nothing to him? There! It is\r\ndone. I shall do well enough, and so will my husband. As to leading\r\nme into what you call this fatal step, Miss Havisham would have had me\r\nwait, and not marry yet; but I am tired of the life I have led, which\r\nhas very few charms for me, and I am willing enough to change it. Say no\r\nmore. We shall never understand each other.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuch a mean brute, such a stupid brute!\xe2\x80\x9d I urged, in despair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t be afraid of my being a blessing to him,\xe2\x80\x9d said Estella; \xe2\x80\x9cI shall\r\nnot be that. Come! Here is my hand. Do we part on this, you visionary\r\nboy--or man?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO Estella!\xe2\x80\x9d I answered, as my bitter tears fell fast on her hand, do\r\nwhat I would to restrain them; \xe2\x80\x9ceven if I remained in England and could\r\nhold my head up with the rest, how could I see you Drummle\xe2\x80\x99s wife?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNonsense,\xe2\x80\x9d she returned,--\xe2\x80\x9cnonsense. This will pass in no time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNever, Estella!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will get me out of your thoughts in a week.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOut of my thoughts! You are part of my existence, part of myself. You\r\nhave been in every line I have ever read since I first came here, the\r\nrough common boy whose poor heart you wounded even then. You have been\r\nin every prospect I have ever seen since,--on the river, on the sails of\r\nthe ships, on the marshes, in the clouds, in the light, in the darkness,\r\nin the wind, in the woods, in the sea, in the streets. You have been\r\nthe embodiment of every graceful fancy that my mind has ever become\r\nacquainted with. The stones of which the strongest London buildings\r\nare made are not more real, or more impossible to be displaced by your\r\nhands, than your presence and influence have been to me, there and\r\neverywhere, and will be. Estella, to the last hour of my life, you\r\ncannot choose but remain part of my character, part of the little good\r\nin me, part of the evil. But, in this separation, I associate you only\r\nwith the good; and I will faithfully hold you to that always, for you\r\nmust have done me far more good than harm, let me feel now what sharp\r\ndistress I may. O God bless you, God forgive you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn what ecstasy of unhappiness I got these broken words out of myself, I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t know. The rhapsody welled up within me, like blood from an\r\ninward wound, and gushed out. I held her hand to my lips some lingering\r\nmoments, and so I left her. But ever afterwards, I remembered,--and soon\r\nafterwards with stronger reason,--that while Estella looked at me merely\r\nwith incredulous wonder, the spectral figure of Miss Havisham, her hand\r\nstill covering her heart, seemed all resolved into a ghastly stare of\r\npity and remorse.\r\n\r\nAll done, all gone! So much was done and gone, that when I went out at\r\nthe gate, the light of the day seemed of a darker color than when I went\r\nin. For a while, I hid myself among some lanes and by-paths, and then\r\nstruck off to walk all the way to London. For, I had by that time come\r\nto myself so far as to consider that I could not go back to the inn and\r\nsee Drummle there; that I could not bear to sit upon the coach and\r\nbe spoken to; that I could do nothing half so good for myself as tire\r\nmyself out.\r\n\r\nIt was past midnight when I crossed London Bridge. Pursuing the narrow\r\nintricacies of the streets which at that time tended westward near the\r\nMiddlesex shore of the river, my readiest access to the Temple was\r\nclose by the river-side, through Whitefriars. I was not expected till\r\nto-morrow; but I had my keys, and, if Herbert were gone to bed, could\r\nget to bed myself without disturbing him.\r\n\r\nAs it seldom happened that I came in at that Whitefriars gate after the\r\nTemple was closed, and as I was very muddy and weary, I did not take it\r\nill that the night-porter examined me with much attention as he held the\r\ngate a little way open for me to pass in. To help his memory I mentioned\r\nmy name.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was not quite sure, sir, but I thought so. Here\xe2\x80\x99s a note, sir. The\r\nmessenger that brought it, said would you be so good as read it by my\r\nlantern?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMuch surprised by the request, I took the note. It was directed to\r\nPhilip Pip, Esquire, and on the top of the superscription were the\r\nwords, \xe2\x80\x9cPLEASE READ THIS, HERE.\xe2\x80\x9d I opened it, the watchman holding up\r\nhis light, and read inside, in Wemmick\xe2\x80\x99s writing,--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDON\xe2\x80\x99T GO HOME.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XLV\r\n\r\nTurning from the Temple gate as soon as I had read the warning, I made\r\nthe best of my way to Fleet Street, and there got a late hackney chariot\r\nand drove to the Hummums in Covent Garden. In those times a bed was\r\nalways to be got there at any hour of the night, and the chamberlain,\r\nletting me in at his ready wicket, lighted the candle next in order on\r\nhis shelf, and showed me straight into the bedroom next in order on his\r\nlist. It was a sort of vault on the ground floor at the back, with a\r\ndespotic monster of a four-post bedstead in it, straddling over the\r\nwhole place, putting one of his arbitrary legs into the fireplace\r\nand another into the doorway, and squeezing the wretched little\r\nwashing-stand in quite a Divinely Righteous manner.\r\n\r\nAs I had asked for a night-light, the chamberlain had brought me in,\r\nbefore he left me, the good old constitutional rushlight of those\r\nvirtuous days--an object like the ghost of a walking-cane, which\r\ninstantly broke its back if it were touched, which nothing could ever be\r\nlighted at, and which was placed in solitary confinement at the bottom\r\nof a high tin tower, perforated with round holes that made a staringly\r\nwide-awake pattern on the walls. When I had got into bed, and lay there\r\nfootsore, weary, and wretched, I found that I could no more close my own\r\neyes than I could close the eyes of this foolish Argus. And thus, in the\r\ngloom and death of the night, we stared at one another.\r\n\r\nWhat a doleful night! How anxious, how dismal, how long! There was an\r\ninhospitable smell in the room, of cold soot and hot dust; and, as I\r\nlooked up into the corners of the tester over my head, I thought what\r\na number of blue-bottle flies from the butchers\xe2\x80\x99, and earwigs from the\r\nmarket, and grubs from the country, must be holding on up there, lying\r\nby for next summer. This led me to speculate whether any of them ever\r\ntumbled down, and then I fancied that I felt light falls on my face,--a\r\ndisagreeable turn of thought, suggesting other and more objectionable\r\napproaches up my back. When I had lain awake a little while, those\r\nextraordinary voices with which silence teems began to make themselves\r\naudible. The closet whispered, the fireplace sighed, the little\r\nwashing-stand ticked, and one guitar-string played occasionally in the\r\nchest of drawers. At about the same time, the eyes on the wall acquired\r\na new expression, and in every one of those staring rounds I saw\r\nwritten, DON\xe2\x80\x99T GO HOME.\r\n\r\nWhatever night-fancies and night-noises crowded on me, they never warded\r\noff this DON\xe2\x80\x99T GO HOME. It plaited itself into whatever I thought of,\r\nas a bodily pain would have done. Not long before, I had read in the\r\nnewspapers, how a gentleman unknown had come to the Hummums in the\r\nnight, and had gone to bed, and had destroyed himself, and had been\r\nfound in the morning weltering in blood. It came into my head that he\r\nmust have occupied this very vault of mine, and I got out of bed to\r\nassure myself that there were no red marks about; then opened the door\r\nto look out into the passages, and cheer myself with the companionship\r\nof a distant light, near which I knew the chamberlain to be dozing. But\r\nall this time, why I was not to go home, and what had happened at home,\r\nand when I should go home, and whether Provis was safe at home, were\r\nquestions occupying my mind so busily, that one might have supposed\r\nthere could be no more room in it for any other theme. Even when I\r\nthought of Estella, and how we had parted that day forever, and when\r\nI recalled all the circumstances of our parting, and all her looks and\r\ntones, and the action of her fingers while she knitted,--even then I\r\nwas pursuing, here and there and everywhere, the caution, Don\xe2\x80\x99t go home.\r\nWhen at last I dozed, in sheer exhaustion of mind and body, it became\r\na vast shadowy verb which I had to conjugate. Imperative mood, present\r\ntense: Do not thou go home, let him not go home, let us not go home, do\r\nnot ye or you go home, let not them go home. Then potentially: I may not\r\nand I cannot go home; and I might not, could not, would not, and should\r\nnot go home; until I felt that I was going distracted, and rolled over\r\non the pillow, and looked at the staring rounds upon the wall again.\r\n\r\nI had left directions that I was to be called at seven; for it was plain\r\nthat I must see Wemmick before seeing any one else, and equally plain\r\nthat this was a case in which his Walworth sentiments only could be\r\ntaken. It was a relief to get out of the room where the night had been\r\nso miserable, and I needed no second knocking at the door to startle me\r\nfrom my uneasy bed.\r\n\r\nThe Castle battlements arose upon my view at eight o\xe2\x80\x99clock. The little\r\nservant happening to be entering the fortress with two hot rolls, I\r\npassed through the postern and crossed the drawbridge in her company,\r\nand so came without announcement into the presence of Wemmick as he was\r\nmaking tea for himself and the Aged. An open door afforded a perspective\r\nview of the Aged in bed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHalloa, Mr. Pip!\xe2\x80\x9d said Wemmick. \xe2\x80\x9cYou did come home, then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d I returned; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I didn\xe2\x80\x99t go home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s all right,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, rubbing his hands. \xe2\x80\x9cI left a note for you\r\nat each of the Temple gates, on the chance. Which gate did you come to?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI told him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll go round to the others in the course of the day and destroy the\r\nnotes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wemmick; \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s a good rule never to leave documentary\r\nevidence if you can help it, because you don\xe2\x80\x99t know when it may be put\r\nin. I\xe2\x80\x99m going to take a liberty with you. Would you mind toasting this\r\nsausage for the Aged P.?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI said I should be delighted to do it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you can go about your work, Mary Anne,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wemmick to the little\r\nservant; \xe2\x80\x9cwhich leaves us to ourselves, don\xe2\x80\x99t you see, Mr. Pip?\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nadded, winking, as she disappeared.\r\n\r\nI thanked him for his friendship and caution, and our discourse\r\nproceeded in a low tone, while I toasted the Aged\xe2\x80\x99s sausage and he\r\nbuttered the crumb of the Aged\xe2\x80\x99s roll.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, Mr. Pip, you know,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wemmick, \xe2\x80\x9cyou and I understand one\r\nanother. We are in our private and personal capacities, and we have been\r\nengaged in a confidential transaction before to-day. Official sentiments\r\nare one thing. We are extra official.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI cordially assented. I was so very nervous, that I had already lighted\r\nthe Aged\xe2\x80\x99s sausage like a torch, and been obliged to blow it out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI accidentally heard, yesterday morning,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wemmick, \xe2\x80\x9cbeing in a\r\ncertain place where I once took you,--even between you and me, it\xe2\x80\x99s as\r\nwell not to mention names when avoidable--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMuch better not,\xe2\x80\x9d said I. \xe2\x80\x9cI understand you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI heard there by chance, yesterday morning,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wemmick, \xe2\x80\x9cthat\r\na certain person not altogether of uncolonial pursuits, and not\r\nunpossessed of portable property,--I don\xe2\x80\x99t know who it may really\r\nbe,--we won\xe2\x80\x99t name this person--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot necessary,\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c--Had made some little stir in a certain part of the world where a good\r\nmany people go, not always in gratification of their own inclinations,\r\nand not quite irrespective of the government expense--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn watching his face, I made quite a firework of the Aged\xe2\x80\x99s sausage,\r\nand greatly discomposed both my own attention and Wemmick\xe2\x80\x99s; for which I\r\napologized.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c--By disappearing from such place, and being no more heard of\r\nthereabouts. From which,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wemmick, \xe2\x80\x9cconjectures had been raised and\r\ntheories formed. I also heard that you at your chambers in Garden Court,\r\nTemple, had been watched, and might be watched again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy whom?\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t go into that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wemmick, evasively, \xe2\x80\x9cit might clash with\r\nofficial responsibilities. I heard it, as I have in my time heard other\r\ncurious things in the same place. I don\xe2\x80\x99t tell it you on information\r\nreceived. I heard it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe took the toasting-fork and sausage from me as he spoke, and set forth\r\nthe Aged\xe2\x80\x99s breakfast neatly on a little tray. Previous to placing it\r\nbefore him, he went into the Aged\xe2\x80\x99s room with a clean white cloth, and\r\ntied the same under the old gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s chin, and propped him up, and\r\nput his nightcap on one side, and gave him quite a rakish air. Then he\r\nplaced his breakfast before him with great care, and said, \xe2\x80\x9cAll right,\r\nain\xe2\x80\x99t you, Aged P.?\xe2\x80\x9d To which the cheerful Aged replied, \xe2\x80\x9cAll right,\r\nJohn, my boy, all right!\xe2\x80\x9d As there seemed to be a tacit understanding\r\nthat the Aged was not in a presentable state, and was therefore to be\r\nconsidered invisible, I made a pretence of being in complete ignorance\r\nof these proceedings.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis watching of me at my chambers (which I have once had reason to\r\nsuspect),\xe2\x80\x9d I said to Wemmick when he came back, \xe2\x80\x9cis inseparable from the\r\nperson to whom you have adverted; is it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWemmick looked very serious. \xe2\x80\x9cI couldn\xe2\x80\x99t undertake to say that, of my\r\nown knowledge. I mean, I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t undertake to say it was at first. But\r\nit either is, or it will be, or it\xe2\x80\x99s in great danger of being.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs I saw that he was restrained by fealty to Little Britain from saying\r\nas much as he could, and as I knew with thankfulness to him how far out\r\nof his way he went to say what he did, I could not press him. But I told\r\nhim, after a little meditation over the fire, that I would like to ask\r\nhim a question, subject to his answering or not answering, as he\r\ndeemed right, and sure that his course would be right. He paused in his\r\nbreakfast, and crossing his arms, and pinching his shirt-sleeves (his\r\nnotion of in-door comfort was to sit without any coat), he nodded to me\r\nonce, to put my question.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have heard of a man of bad character, whose true name is\r\nCompeyson?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe answered with one other nod.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs he living?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOne other nod.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs he in London?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe gave me one other nod, compressed the post-office exceedingly, gave\r\nme one last nod, and went on with his breakfast.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wemmick, \xe2\x80\x9cquestioning being over,\xe2\x80\x9d which he emphasized and\r\nrepeated for my guidance, \xe2\x80\x9cI come to what I did, after hearing what I\r\nheard. I went to Garden Court to find you; not finding you, I went to\r\nClarriker\xe2\x80\x99s to find Mr. Herbert.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd him you found?\xe2\x80\x9d said I, with great anxiety.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd him I found. Without mentioning any names or going into any\r\ndetails, I gave him to understand that if he was aware of anybody--Tom,\r\nJack, or Richard--being about the chambers, or about the immediate\r\nneighborhood, he had better get Tom, Jack, or Richard out of the way\r\nwhile you were out of the way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe would be greatly puzzled what to do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe was puzzled what to do; not the less, because I gave him my opinion\r\nthat it was not safe to try to get Tom, Jack, or Richard too far out\r\nof the way at present. Mr. Pip, I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you something. Under existing\r\ncircumstances, there is no place like a great city when you are once\r\nin it. Don\xe2\x80\x99t break cover too soon. Lie close. Wait till things slacken,\r\nbefore you try the open, even for foreign air.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI thanked him for his valuable advice, and asked him what Herbert had\r\ndone?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Herbert,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wemmick, \xe2\x80\x9cafter being all of a heap for half an\r\nhour, struck out a plan. He mentioned to me as a secret, that he is\r\ncourting a young lady who has, as no doubt you are aware, a bedridden\r\nPa. Which Pa, having been in the Purser line of life, lies a-bed in a\r\nbow-window where he can see the ships sail up and down the river. You\r\nare acquainted with the young lady, most probably?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot personally,\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\nThe truth was, that she had objected to me as an expensive companion\r\nwho did Herbert no good, and that, when Herbert had first proposed to\r\npresent me to her, she had received the proposal with such very moderate\r\nwarmth, that Herbert had felt himself obliged to confide the state of\r\nthe case to me, with a view to the lapse of a little time before I made\r\nher acquaintance. When I had begun to advance Herbert\xe2\x80\x99s prospects by\r\nstealth, I had been able to bear this with cheerful philosophy: he and\r\nhis affianced, for their part, had naturally not been very anxious to\r\nintroduce a third person into their interviews; and thus, although I was\r\nassured that I had risen in Clara\xe2\x80\x99s esteem, and although the young\r\nlady and I had long regularly interchanged messages and remembrances by\r\nHerbert, I had never seen her. However, I did not trouble Wemmick with\r\nthese particulars.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe house with the bow-window,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wemmick, \xe2\x80\x9cbeing by the river-side,\r\ndown the Pool there between Limehouse and Greenwich, and being kept, it\r\nseems, by a very respectable widow who has a furnished upper floor to\r\nlet, Mr. Herbert put it to me, what did I think of that as a temporary\r\ntenement for Tom, Jack, or Richard? Now, I thought very well of it, for\r\nthree reasons I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you. That is to say: Firstly. It\xe2\x80\x99s altogether\r\nout of all your beats, and is well away from the usual heap of streets\r\ngreat and small. Secondly. Without going near it yourself, you could\r\nalways hear of the safety of Tom, Jack, or Richard, through Mr. Herbert.\r\nThirdly. After a while and when it might be prudent, if you should want\r\nto slip Tom, Jack, or Richard on board a foreign packet-boat, there he\r\nis--ready.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMuch comforted by these considerations, I thanked Wemmick again and\r\nagain, and begged him to proceed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, sir! Mr. Herbert threw himself into the business with a will, and\r\nby nine o\xe2\x80\x99clock last night he housed Tom, Jack, or Richard,--whichever\r\nit may be,--you and I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to know,--quite successfully. At the\r\nold lodgings it was understood that he was summoned to Dover, and, in\r\nfact, he was taken down the Dover road and cornered out of it. Now,\r\nanother great advantage of all this is, that it was done without you,\r\nand when, if any one was concerning himself about your movements, you\r\nmust be known to be ever so many miles off and quite otherwise engaged.\r\nThis diverts suspicion and confuses it; and for the same reason I\r\nrecommended that, even if you came back last night, you should not go\r\nhome. It brings in more confusion, and you want confusion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWemmick, having finished his breakfast, here looked at his watch, and\r\nbegan to get his coat on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd now, Mr. Pip,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, with his hands still in the sleeves, \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nhave probably done the most I can do; but if I can ever do more,--from\r\na Walworth point of view, and in a strictly private and personal\r\ncapacity,--I shall be glad to do it. Here\xe2\x80\x99s the address. There can be\r\nno harm in your going here to-night, and seeing for yourself that all is\r\nwell with Tom, Jack, or Richard, before you go home,--which is another\r\nreason for your not going home last night. But, after you have gone\r\nhome, don\xe2\x80\x99t go back here. You are very welcome, I am sure, Mr. Pip\xe2\x80\x9d; his\r\nhands were now out of his sleeves, and I was shaking them; \xe2\x80\x9cand let me\r\nfinally impress one important point upon you.\xe2\x80\x9d He laid his hands upon\r\nmy shoulders, and added in a solemn whisper: \xe2\x80\x9cAvail yourself of this\r\nevening to lay hold of his portable property. You don\xe2\x80\x99t know what may\r\nhappen to him. Don\xe2\x80\x99t let anything happen to the portable property.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nQuite despairing of making my mind clear to Wemmick on this point, I\r\nforbore to try.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTime\xe2\x80\x99s up,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wemmick, \xe2\x80\x9cand I must be off. If you had nothing more\r\npressing to do than to keep here till dark, that\xe2\x80\x99s what I should advise.\r\nYou look very much worried, and it would do you good to have a perfectly\r\nquiet day with the Aged,--he\xe2\x80\x99ll be up presently,--and a little bit\r\nof--you remember the pig?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course,\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell; and a little bit of him. That sausage you toasted was his, and\r\nhe was in all respects a first-rater. Do try him, if it is only for old\r\nacquaintance sake. Good-bye, Aged Parent!\xe2\x80\x9d in a cheery shout.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll right, John; all right, my boy!\xe2\x80\x9d piped the old man from within.\r\n\r\nI soon fell asleep before Wemmick\xe2\x80\x99s fire, and the Aged and I enjoyed one\r\nanother\xe2\x80\x99s society by falling asleep before it more or less all day.\r\nWe had loin of pork for dinner, and greens grown on the estate; and\r\nI nodded at the Aged with a good intention whenever I failed to do it\r\ndrowsily. When it was quite dark, I left the Aged preparing the fire for\r\ntoast; and I inferred from the number of teacups, as well as from his\r\nglances at the two little doors in the wall, that Miss Skiffins was\r\nexpected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XLVI\r\n\r\nEight o\xe2\x80\x99clock had struck before I got into the air, that was scented,\r\nnot disagreeably, by the chips and shavings of the long-shore\r\nboat-builders, and mast, oar, and block makers. All that water-side\r\nregion of the upper and lower Pool below Bridge was unknown ground to\r\nme; and when I struck down by the river, I found that the spot I wanted\r\nwas not where I had supposed it to be, and was anything but easy to\r\nfind. It was called Mill Pond Bank, Chinks\xe2\x80\x99s Basin; and I had no other\r\nguide to Chinks\xe2\x80\x99s Basin than the Old Green Copper Rope-walk.\r\n\r\nIt matters not what stranded ships repairing in dry docks I lost myself\r\namong, what old hulls of ships in course of being knocked to pieces,\r\nwhat ooze and slime and other dregs of tide, what yards of ship-builders\r\nand ship-breakers, what rusty anchors blindly biting into the ground,\r\nthough for years off duty, what mountainous country of accumulated casks\r\nand timber, how many rope-walks that were not the Old Green Copper. After\r\nseveral times falling short of my destination and as often overshooting\r\nit, I came unexpectedly round a corner, upon Mill Pond Bank. It was a\r\nfresh kind of place, all circumstances considered, where the wind from\r\nthe river had room to turn itself round; and there were two or three\r\ntrees in it, and there was the stump of a ruined windmill, and there\r\nwas the Old Green Copper Rope-walk,--whose long and narrow vista I could\r\ntrace in the moonlight, along a series of wooden frames set in the\r\nground, that looked like superannuated haymaking-rakes which had grown\r\nold and lost most of their teeth.\r\n\r\nSelecting from the few queer houses upon Mill Pond Bank a house with a\r\nwooden front and three stories of bow-window (not bay-window, which is\r\nanother thing), I looked at the plate upon the door, and read there,\r\nMrs. Whimple. That being the name I wanted, I knocked, and an elderly\r\nwoman of a pleasant and thriving appearance responded. She was\r\nimmediately deposed, however, by Herbert, who silently led me into\r\nthe parlor and shut the door. It was an odd sensation to see his very\r\nfamiliar face established quite at home in that very unfamiliar room\r\nand region; and I found myself looking at him, much as I looked at\r\nthe corner-cupboard with the glass and china, the shells upon the\r\nchimney-piece, and the colored engravings on the wall, representing the\r\ndeath of Captain Cook, a ship-launch, and his Majesty King George the\r\nThird in a state coachman\xe2\x80\x99s wig, leather-breeches, and top-boots, on the\r\nterrace at Windsor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll is well, Handel,\xe2\x80\x9d said Herbert, \xe2\x80\x9cand he is quite satisfied, though\r\neager to see you. My dear girl is with her father; and if you\xe2\x80\x99ll wait\r\ntill she comes down, I\xe2\x80\x99ll make you known to her, and then we\xe2\x80\x99ll go upstairs.\r\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s her father.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI had become aware of an alarming growling overhead, and had probably\r\nexpressed the fact in my countenance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am afraid he is a sad old rascal,\xe2\x80\x9d said Herbert, smiling, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I have\r\nnever seen him. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you smell rum? He is always at it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt rum?\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Herbert, \xe2\x80\x9cand you may suppose how mild it makes his\r\ngout. He persists, too, in keeping all the provisions upstairs in his\r\nroom, and serving them out. He keeps them on shelves over his head, and\r\nwill weigh them all. His room must be like a chandler\xe2\x80\x99s shop.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhile he thus spoke, the growling noise became a prolonged roar, and\r\nthen died away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat else can be the consequence,\xe2\x80\x9d said Herbert, in explanation, \xe2\x80\x9cif\r\nhe will cut the cheese? A man with the gout in his right hand--and\r\neverywhere else--can\xe2\x80\x99t expect to get through a Double Gloucester without\r\nhurting himself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe seemed to have hurt himself very much, for he gave another furious\r\nroar.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo have Provis for an upper lodger is quite a godsend to Mrs. Whimple,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n said Herbert, \xe2\x80\x9cfor of course people in general won\xe2\x80\x99t stand that noise. A\r\ncurious place, Handel; isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was a curious place, indeed; but remarkably well kept and clean.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Whimple,\xe2\x80\x9d said Herbert, when I told him so, \xe2\x80\x9cis the best of\r\nhousewives, and I really do not know what my Clara would do without\r\nher motherly help. For, Clara has no mother of her own, Handel, and no\r\nrelation in the world but old Gruffandgrim.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSurely that\xe2\x80\x99s not his name, Herbert?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no,\xe2\x80\x9d said Herbert, \xe2\x80\x9cthat\xe2\x80\x99s my name for him. His name is Mr. Barley.\r\nBut what a blessing it is for the son of my father and mother to love a\r\ngirl who has no relations, and who can never bother herself or anybody\r\nelse about her family!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHerbert had told me on former occasions, and now reminded me, that he\r\nfirst knew Miss Clara Barley when she was completing her education at\r\nan establishment at Hammersmith, and that on her being recalled home\r\nto nurse her father, he and she had confided their affection to the\r\nmotherly Mrs. Whimple, by whom it had been fostered and regulated\r\nwith equal kindness and discretion, ever since. It was understood that\r\nnothing of a tender nature could possibly be confided to old Barley, by\r\nreason of his being totally unequal to the consideration of any subject\r\nmore psychological than Gout, Rum, and Purser\xe2\x80\x99s stores.\r\n\r\nAs we were thus conversing in a low tone while Old Barley\xe2\x80\x99s sustained\r\ngrowl vibrated in the beam that crossed the ceiling, the room door\r\nopened, and a very pretty, slight, dark-eyed girl of twenty or so came\r\nin with a basket in her hand: whom Herbert tenderly relieved of the\r\nbasket, and presented, blushing, as \xe2\x80\x9cClara.\xe2\x80\x9d She really was a most\r\ncharming girl, and might have passed for a captive fairy, whom that\r\ntruculent Ogre, Old Barley, had pressed into his service.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook here,\xe2\x80\x9d said Herbert, showing me the basket, with a compassionate\r\nand tender smile, after we had talked a little; \xe2\x80\x9chere\xe2\x80\x99s poor Clara\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsupper, served out every night. Here\xe2\x80\x99s her allowance of bread, and\r\nhere\xe2\x80\x99s her slice of cheese, and here\xe2\x80\x99s her rum,--which I drink. This\r\nis Mr. Barley\xe2\x80\x99s breakfast for to-morrow, served out to be cooked. Two\r\nmutton-chops, three potatoes, some split peas, a little flour, two\r\nounces of butter, a pinch of salt, and all this black pepper. It\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nstewed up together, and taken hot, and it\xe2\x80\x99s a nice thing for the gout, I\r\nshould think!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was something so natural and winning in Clara\xe2\x80\x99s resigned way of\r\nlooking at these stores in detail, as Herbert pointed them out; and\r\nsomething so confiding, loving, and innocent in her modest manner of\r\nyielding herself to Herbert\xe2\x80\x99s embracing arm; and something so gentle in\r\nher, so much needing protection on Mill Pond Bank, by Chinks\xe2\x80\x99s Basin,\r\nand the Old Green Copper Rope-walk, with Old Barley growling in the\r\nbeam,--that I would not have undone the engagement between her and\r\nHerbert for all the money in the pocket-book I had never opened.\r\n\r\nI was looking at her with pleasure and admiration, when suddenly the\r\ngrowl swelled into a roar again, and a frightful bumping noise was heard\r\nabove, as if a giant with a wooden leg were trying to bore it through\r\nthe ceiling to come at us. Upon this Clara said to Herbert, \xe2\x80\x9cPapa wants\r\nme, darling!\xe2\x80\x9d and ran away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is an unconscionable old shark for you!\xe2\x80\x9d said Herbert. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do\r\nyou suppose he wants now, Handel?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know,\xe2\x80\x9d said I. \xe2\x80\x9cSomething to drink?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s it!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Herbert, as if I had made a guess of extraordinary\r\nmerit. \xe2\x80\x9cHe keeps his grog ready mixed in a little tub on the table.\r\nWait a moment, and you\xe2\x80\x99ll hear Clara lift him up to take some. There\r\nhe goes!\xe2\x80\x9d Another roar, with a prolonged shake at the end. \xe2\x80\x9cNow,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nHerbert, as it was succeeded by silence, \xe2\x80\x9che\xe2\x80\x99s drinking. Now,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nHerbert, as the growl resounded in the beam once more, \xe2\x80\x9che\xe2\x80\x99s down again\r\non his back!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nClara returned soon afterwards, and Herbert accompanied me upstairs to\r\nsee our charge. As we passed Mr. Barley\xe2\x80\x99s door, he was heard hoarsely\r\nmuttering within, in a strain that rose and fell like wind, the\r\nfollowing Refrain, in which I substitute good wishes for something quite\r\nthe reverse:--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAhoy! Bless your eyes, here\xe2\x80\x99s old Bill Barley. Here\xe2\x80\x99s old Bill Barley,\r\nbless your eyes. Here\xe2\x80\x99s old Bill Barley on the flat of his back, by the\r\nLord. Lying on the flat of his back like a drifting old dead flounder,\r\nhere\xe2\x80\x99s your old Bill Barley, bless your eyes. Ahoy! Bless you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn this strain of consolation, Herbert informed me the invisible Barley\r\nwould commune with himself by the day and night together; Often, while\r\nit was light, having, at the same time, one eye at a telescope which was\r\nfitted on his bed for the convenience of sweeping the river.\r\n\r\nIn his two cabin rooms at the top of the house, which were fresh and\r\nairy, and in which Mr. Barley was less audible than below, I found\r\nProvis comfortably settled. He expressed no alarm, and seemed to\r\nfeel none that was worth mentioning; but it struck me that he was\r\nsoftened,--indefinably, for I could not have said how, and could never\r\nafterwards recall how when I tried, but certainly.\r\n\r\nThe opportunity that the day\xe2\x80\x99s rest had given me for reflection had\r\nresulted in my fully determining to say nothing to him respecting\r\nCompeyson. For anything I knew, his animosity towards the man\r\nmight otherwise lead to his seeking him out and rushing on his own\r\ndestruction. Therefore, when Herbert and I sat down with him by his\r\nfire, I asked him first of all whether he relied on Wemmick\xe2\x80\x99s judgment\r\nand sources of information?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, ay, dear boy!\xe2\x80\x9d he answered, with a grave nod, \xe2\x80\x9cJaggers knows.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen, I have talked with Wemmick,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cand have come to tell you\r\nwhat caution he gave me and what advice.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis I did accurately, with the reservation just mentioned; and I told\r\nhim how Wemmick had heard, in Newgate prison (whether from officers or\r\nprisoners I could not say), that he was under some suspicion, and that\r\nmy chambers had been watched; how Wemmick had recommended his keeping\r\nclose for a time, and my keeping away from him; and what Wemmick had\r\nsaid about getting him abroad. I added, that of course, when the time\r\ncame, I should go with him, or should follow close upon him, as might\r\nbe safest in Wemmick\xe2\x80\x99s judgment. What was to follow that I did not touch\r\nupon; neither, indeed, was I at all clear or comfortable about it in my\r\nown mind, now that I saw him in that softer condition, and in declared\r\nperil for my sake. As to altering my way of living by enlarging my\r\nexpenses, I put it to him whether in our present unsettled and difficult\r\ncircumstances, it would not be simply ridiculous, if it were no worse?\r\n\r\nHe could not deny this, and indeed was very reasonable throughout. His\r\ncoming back was a venture, he said, and he had always known it to be a\r\nventure. He would do nothing to make it a desperate venture, and he had\r\nvery little fear of his safety with such good help.\r\n\r\nHerbert, who had been looking at the fire and pondering, here said\r\nthat something had come into his thoughts arising out of Wemmick\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsuggestion, which it might be worth while to pursue. \xe2\x80\x9cWe are both good\r\nwatermen, Handel, and could take him down the river ourselves when the\r\nright time comes. No boat would then be hired for the purpose, and no\r\nboatmen; that would save at least a chance of suspicion, and any chance\r\nis worth saving. Never mind the season; don\xe2\x80\x99t you think it might be a\r\ngood thing if you began at once to keep a boat at the Temple stairs, and\r\nwere in the habit of rowing up and down the river? You fall into that\r\nhabit, and then who notices or minds? Do it twenty or fifty times,\r\nand there is nothing special in your doing it the twenty-first or\r\nfifty-first.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI liked this scheme, and Provis was quite elated by it. We agreed\r\nthat it should be carried into execution, and that Provis should never\r\nrecognize us if we came below Bridge, and rowed past Mill Pond Bank. But\r\nwe further agreed that he should pull down the blind in that part of his\r\nwindow which gave upon the east, whenever he saw us and all was right.\r\n\r\nOur conference being now ended, and everything arranged, I rose to go;\r\nremarking to Herbert that he and I had better not go home together, and\r\nthat I would take half an hour\xe2\x80\x99s start of him. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t like to leave\r\nyou here,\xe2\x80\x9d I said to Provis, \xe2\x80\x9cthough I cannot doubt your being safer\r\nhere than near me. Good-bye!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear boy,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered, clasping my hands, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know when we may\r\nmeet again, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t like good-bye. Say good night!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGood night! Herbert will go regularly between us, and when the time\r\ncomes you may be certain I shall be ready. Good night, good night!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe thought it best that he should stay in his own rooms; and we left him\r\non the landing outside his door, holding a light over the stair-rail to\r\nlight us downstairs. Looking back at him, I thought of the first night\r\nof his return, when our positions were reversed, and when I little\r\nsupposed my heart could ever be as heavy and anxious at parting from him\r\nas it was now.\r\n\r\nOld Barley was growling and swearing when we repassed his door, with no\r\nappearance of having ceased or of meaning to cease. When we got to the\r\nfoot of the stairs, I asked Herbert whether he had preserved the name of\r\nProvis. He replied, certainly not, and that the lodger was Mr. Campbell.\r\nHe also explained that the utmost known of Mr. Campbell there was,\r\nthat he (Herbert) had Mr. Campbell consigned to him, and felt a strong\r\npersonal interest in his being well cared for, and living a secluded\r\nlife. So, when we went into the parlor where Mrs. Whimple and Clara were\r\nseated at work, I said nothing of my own interest in Mr. Campbell, but\r\nkept it to myself.\r\n\r\nWhen I had taken leave of the pretty, gentle, dark-eyed girl, and of the\r\nmotherly woman who had not outlived her honest sympathy with a little\r\naffair of true love, I felt as if the Old Green Copper Rope-walk had\r\ngrown quite a different place. Old Barley might be as old as the hills,\r\nand might swear like a whole field of troopers, but there were redeeming\r\nyouth and trust and hope enough in Chinks\xe2\x80\x99s Basin to fill it to\r\noverflowing. And then I thought of Estella, and of our parting, and went\r\nhome very sadly.\r\n\r\nAll things were as quiet in the Temple as ever I had seen them. The\r\nwindows of the rooms on that side, lately occupied by Provis, were dark\r\nand still, and there was no lounger in Garden Court. I walked past the\r\nfountain twice or thrice before I descended the steps that were between\r\nme and my rooms, but I was quite alone. Herbert, coming to my\r\nbedside when he came in,--for I went straight to bed, dispirited and\r\nfatigued,--made the same report. Opening one of the windows after that,\r\nhe looked out into the moonlight, and told me that the pavement was as\r\nsolemnly empty as the pavement of any cathedral at that same hour.\r\n\r\nNext day I set myself to get the boat. It was soon done, and the boat\r\nwas brought round to the Temple stairs, and lay where I could reach\r\nher within a minute or two. Then, I began to go out as for training and\r\npractice: sometimes alone, sometimes with Herbert. I was often out in\r\ncold, rain, and sleet, but nobody took much note of me after I had been\r\nout a few times. At first, I kept above Blackfriars Bridge; but as the\r\nhours of the tide changed, I took towards London Bridge. It was Old\r\nLondon Bridge in those days, and at certain states of the tide there\r\nwas a race and fall of water there which gave it a bad reputation. But I\r\nknew well enough how to \xe2\x80\x98shoot\xe2\x80\x99 the bridge after seeing it done, and so\r\nbegan to row about among the shipping in the Pool, and down to Erith.\r\nThe first time I passed Mill Pond Bank, Herbert and I were pulling a\r\npair of oars; and, both in going and returning, we saw the blind towards\r\nthe east come down. Herbert was rarely there less frequently than three\r\ntimes in a week, and he never brought me a single word of intelligence\r\nthat was at all alarming. Still, I knew that there was cause for alarm,\r\nand I could not get rid of the notion of being watched. Once received,\r\nit is a haunting idea; how many undesigning persons I suspected of\r\nwatching me, it would be hard to calculate.\r\n\r\nIn short, I was always full of fears for the rash man who was in hiding.\r\nHerbert had sometimes said to me that he found it pleasant to stand at\r\none of our windows after dark, when the tide was running down, and to\r\nthink that it was flowing, with everything it bore, towards Clara. But\r\nI thought with dread that it was flowing towards Magwitch, and that\r\nany black mark on its surface might be his pursuers, going swiftly,\r\nsilently, and surely, to take him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XLVII\r\n\r\nSome weeks passed without bringing any change. We waited for Wemmick,\r\nand he made no sign. If I had never known him out of Little Britain, and\r\nhad never enjoyed the privilege of being on a familiar footing at the\r\nCastle, I might have doubted him; not so for a moment, knowing him as I\r\ndid.\r\n\r\nMy worldly affairs began to wear a gloomy appearance, and I was pressed\r\nfor money by more than one creditor. Even I myself began to know the\r\nwant of money (I mean of ready money in my own pocket), and to relieve\r\nit by converting some easily spared articles of jewelery into cash. But\r\nI had quite determined that it would be a heartless fraud to take more\r\nmoney from my patron in the existing state of my uncertain thoughts and\r\nplans. Therefore, I had sent him the unopened pocket-book by Herbert, to\r\nhold in his own keeping, and I felt a kind of satisfaction--whether it\r\nwas a false kind or a true, I hardly know--in not having profited by his\r\ngenerosity since his revelation of himself.\r\n\r\nAs the time wore on, an impression settled heavily upon me that Estella\r\nwas married. Fearful of having it confirmed, though it was all but a\r\nconviction, I avoided the newspapers, and begged Herbert (to whom I had\r\nconfided the circumstances of our last interview) never to speak of her\r\nto me. Why I hoarded up this last wretched little rag of the robe of\r\nhope that was rent and given to the winds, how do I know? Why did you\r\nwho read this, commit that not dissimilar inconsistency of your own last\r\nyear, last month, last week?\r\n\r\nIt was an unhappy life that I lived; and its one dominant anxiety,\r\ntowering over all its other anxieties, like a high mountain above a\r\nrange of mountains, never disappeared from my view. Still, no new cause\r\nfor fear arose. Let me start from my bed as I would, with the terror\r\nfresh upon me that he was discovered; let me sit listening, as I would\r\nwith dread, for Herbert\xe2\x80\x99s returning step at night, lest it should be\r\nfleeter than ordinary, and winged with evil news,--for all that, and\r\nmuch more to like purpose, the round of things went on. Condemned to\r\ninaction and a state of constant restlessness and suspense, I rowed\r\nabout in my boat, and waited, waited, waited, as I best could.\r\n\r\nThere were states of the tide when, having been down the river, I could\r\nnot get back through the eddy-chafed arches and starlings of old London\r\nBridge; then, I left my boat at a wharf near the Custom House, to be\r\nbrought up afterwards to the Temple stairs. I was not averse to doing\r\nthis, as it served to make me and my boat a commoner incident among the\r\nwater-side people there. From this slight occasion sprang two meetings\r\nthat I have now to tell of.\r\n\r\nOne afternoon, late in the month of February, I came ashore at the wharf\r\nat dusk. I had pulled down as far as Greenwich with the ebb tide, and\r\nhad turned with the tide. It had been a fine bright day, but had become\r\nfoggy as the sun dropped, and I had had to feel my way back among the\r\nshipping, pretty carefully. Both in going and returning, I had seen the\r\nsignal in his window, All well.\r\n\r\nAs it was a raw evening, and I was cold, I thought I would comfort\r\nmyself with dinner at once; and as I had hours of dejection and solitude\r\nbefore me if I went home to the Temple, I thought I would afterwards go\r\nto the play. The theatre where Mr. Wopsle had achieved his questionable\r\ntriumph was in that water-side neighborhood (it is nowhere now), and\r\nto that theatre I resolved to go. I was aware that Mr. Wopsle had\r\nnot succeeded in reviving the Drama, but, on the contrary, had rather\r\npartaken of its decline. He had been ominously heard of, through the\r\nplay-bills, as a faithful Black, in connection with a little girl of\r\nnoble birth, and a monkey. And Herbert had seen him as a predatory\r\nTartar of comic propensities, with a face like a red brick, and an\r\noutrageous hat all over bells.\r\n\r\nI dined at what Herbert and I used to call a geographical chop-house,\r\nwhere there were maps of the world in porter-pot rims on every half-yard\r\nof the tablecloths, and charts of gravy on every one of the knives,--to\r\nthis day there is scarcely a single chop-house within the Lord Mayor\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndominions which is not geographical,--and wore out the time in dozing\r\nover crumbs, staring at gas, and baking in a hot blast of dinners. By\r\nand by, I roused myself, and went to the play.\r\n\r\nThere, I found a virtuous boatswain in His Majesty\xe2\x80\x99s service,--a most\r\nexcellent man, though I could have wished his trousers not quite so\r\ntight in some places, and not quite so loose in others,--who knocked all\r\nthe little men\xe2\x80\x99s hats over their eyes, though he was very generous and\r\nbrave, and who wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t hear of anybody\xe2\x80\x99s paying taxes, though he was\r\nvery patriotic. He had a bag of money in his pocket, like a pudding in\r\nthe cloth, and on that property married a young person in bed-furniture,\r\nwith great rejoicings; the whole population of Portsmouth (nine in\r\nnumber at the last census) turning out on the beach to rub their own\r\nhands and shake everybody else\xe2\x80\x99s, and sing \xe2\x80\x9cFill, fill!\xe2\x80\x9d A certain\r\ndark-complexioned Swab, however, who wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t fill, or do anything else\r\nthat was proposed to him, and whose heart was openly stated (by the\r\nboatswain) to be as black as his figure-head, proposed to two other\r\nSwabs to get all mankind into difficulties; which was so effectually\r\ndone (the Swab family having considerable political influence) that it\r\ntook half the evening to set things right, and then it was only brought\r\nabout through an honest little grocer with a white hat, black gaiters,\r\nand red nose, getting into a clock, with a gridiron, and listening, and\r\ncoming out, and knocking everybody down from behind with the gridiron\r\nwhom he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t confute with what he had overheard. This led to Mr.\r\nWopsle\xe2\x80\x99s (who had never been heard of before) coming in with a star\r\nand garter on, as a plenipotentiary of great power direct from the\r\nAdmiralty, to say that the Swabs were all to go to prison on the spot,\r\nand that he had brought the boatswain down the Union Jack, as a slight\r\nacknowledgment of his public services. The boatswain, unmanned for the\r\nfirst time, respectfully dried his eyes on the Jack, and then cheering\r\nup, and addressing Mr. Wopsle as Your Honor, solicited permission to\r\ntake him by the fin. Mr. Wopsle, conceding his fin with a gracious\r\ndignity, was immediately shoved into a dusty corner, while everybody\r\ndanced a hornpipe; and from that corner, surveying the public with a\r\ndiscontented eye, became aware of me.\r\n\r\nThe second piece was the last new grand comic Christmas pantomime, in\r\nthe first scene of which, it pained me to suspect that I detected\r\nMr. Wopsle with red worsted legs under a highly magnified phosphoric\r\ncountenance and a shock of red curtain-fringe for his hair, engaged\r\nin the manufacture of thunderbolts in a mine, and displaying great\r\ncowardice when his gigantic master came home (very hoarse) to dinner.\r\nBut he presently presented himself under worthier circumstances; for,\r\nthe Genius of Youthful Love being in want of assistance,--on account of\r\nthe parental brutality of an ignorant farmer who opposed the choice\r\nof his daughter\xe2\x80\x99s heart, by purposely falling upon the object, in a\r\nflour-sack, out of the first-floor window,--summoned a sententious\r\nEnchanter; and he, coming up from the antipodes rather unsteadily, after\r\nan apparently violent journey, proved to be Mr. Wopsle in a high-crowned\r\nhat, with a necromantic work in one volume under his arm. The business\r\nof this enchanter on earth being principally to be talked at, sung at,\r\nbutted at, danced at, and flashed at with fires of various colors,\r\nhe had a good deal of time on his hands. And I observed, with great\r\nsurprise, that he devoted it to staring in my direction as if he were\r\nlost in amazement.\r\n\r\nThere was something so remarkable in the increasing glare of Mr.\r\nWopsle\xe2\x80\x99s eye, and he seemed to be turning so many things over in his\r\nmind and to grow so confused, that I could not make it out. I sat\r\nthinking of it long after he had ascended to the clouds in a large\r\nwatch-case, and still I could not make it out. I was still thinking\r\nof it when I came out of the theatre an hour afterwards, and found him\r\nwaiting for me near the door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do you do?\xe2\x80\x9d said I, shaking hands with him as we turned down the\r\nstreet together. \xe2\x80\x9cI saw that you saw me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSaw you, Mr. Pip!\xe2\x80\x9d he returned. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, of course I saw you. But who else\r\nwas there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWho else?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is the strangest thing,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Wopsle, drifting into his lost\r\nlook again; \xe2\x80\x9cand yet I could swear to him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBecoming alarmed, I entreated Mr. Wopsle to explain his meaning.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhether I should have noticed him at first but for your being there,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n said Mr. Wopsle, going on in the same lost way, \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t be positive;\r\nyet I think I should.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nInvoluntarily I looked round me, as I was accustomed to look round me\r\nwhen I went home; for these mysterious words gave me a chill.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh! He can\xe2\x80\x99t be in sight,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Wopsle. \xe2\x80\x9cHe went out before I went\r\noff. I saw him go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHaving the reason that I had for being suspicious, I even suspected\r\nthis poor actor. I mistrusted a design to entrap me into some admission.\r\nTherefore I glanced at him as we walked on together, but said nothing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had a ridiculous fancy that he must be with you, Mr. Pip, till I saw\r\nthat you were quite unconscious of him, sitting behind you there like a\r\nghost.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMy former chill crept over me again, but I was resolved not to speak\r\nyet, for it was quite consistent with his words that he might be set on\r\nto induce me to connect these references with Provis. Of course, I was\r\nperfectly sure and safe that Provis had not been there.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI dare say you wonder at me, Mr. Pip; indeed, I see you do. But it is\r\nso very strange! You\xe2\x80\x99ll hardly believe what I am going to tell you. I\r\ncould hardly believe it myself, if you told me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed?\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, indeed. Mr. Pip, you remember in old times a certain Christmas Day,\r\nwhen you were quite a child, and I dined at Gargery\xe2\x80\x99s, and some soldiers\r\ncame to the door to get a pair of handcuffs mended?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI remember it very well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you remember that there was a chase after two convicts, and that we\r\njoined in it, and that Gargery took you on his back, and that I took the\r\nlead, and you kept up with me as well as you could?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI remember it all very well.\xe2\x80\x9d Better than he thought,--except the last\r\nclause.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you remember that we came up with the two in a ditch, and that\r\nthere was a scuffle between them, and that one of them had been severely\r\nhandled and much mauled about the face by the other?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI see it all before me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd that the soldiers lighted torches, and put the two in the centre,\r\nand that we went on to see the last of them, over the black marshes,\r\nwith the torchlight shining on their faces,--I am particular about\r\nthat,--with the torchlight shining on their faces, when there was an\r\nouter ring of dark night all about us?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said I. \xe2\x80\x9cI remember all that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen, Mr. Pip, one of those two prisoners sat behind you tonight. I saw\r\nhim over your shoulder.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSteady!\xe2\x80\x9d I thought. I asked him then, \xe2\x80\x9cWhich of the two do you suppose\r\nyou saw?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe one who had been mauled,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered readily, \xe2\x80\x9cand I\xe2\x80\x99ll swear I\r\nsaw him! The more I think of him, the more certain I am of him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is very curious!\xe2\x80\x9d said I, with the best assumption I could put on\r\nof its being nothing more to me. \xe2\x80\x9cVery curious indeed!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI cannot exaggerate the enhanced disquiet into which this conversation\r\nthrew me, or the special and peculiar terror I felt at Compeyson\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhaving been behind me \xe2\x80\x9clike a ghost.\xe2\x80\x9d For if he had ever been out of my\r\nthoughts for a few moments together since the hiding had begun, it was\r\nin those very moments when he was closest to me; and to think that I\r\nshould be so unconscious and off my guard after all my care was as if\r\nI had shut an avenue of a hundred doors to keep him out, and then had\r\nfound him at my elbow. I could not doubt, either, that he was there,\r\nbecause I was there, and that, however slight an appearance of danger\r\nthere might be about us, danger was always near and active.\r\n\r\nI put such questions to Mr. Wopsle as, When did the man come in? He\r\ncould not tell me that; he saw me, and over my shoulder he saw the man.\r\nIt was not until he had seen him for some time that he began to identify\r\nhim; but he had from the first vaguely associated him with me, and\r\nknown him as somehow belonging to me in the old village time. How was\r\nhe dressed? Prosperously, but not noticeably otherwise; he thought, in\r\nblack. Was his face at all disfigured? No, he believed not. I believed\r\nnot too, for, although in my brooding state I had taken no especial\r\nnotice of the people behind me, I thought it likely that a face at all\r\ndisfigured would have attracted my attention.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Wopsle had imparted to me all that he could recall or I\r\nextract, and when I had treated him to a little appropriate refreshment,\r\nafter the fatigues of the evening, we parted. It was between twelve and\r\none o\xe2\x80\x99clock when I reached the Temple, and the gates were shut. No one\r\nwas near me when I went in and went home.\r\n\r\nHerbert had come in, and we held a very serious council by the fire. But\r\nthere was nothing to be done, saving to communicate to Wemmick what I\r\nhad that night found out, and to remind him that we waited for his hint.\r\nAs I thought that I might compromise him if I went too often to the\r\nCastle, I made this communication by letter. I wrote it before I went to\r\nbed, and went out and posted it; and again no one was near me. Herbert\r\nand I agreed that we could do nothing else but be very cautious. And\r\nwe were very cautious indeed,--more cautious than before, if that were\r\npossible,--and I for my part never went near Chinks\xe2\x80\x99s Basin, except\r\nwhen I rowed by, and then I only looked at Mill Pond Bank as I looked at\r\nanything else.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XLVIII\r\n\r\nThe second of the two meetings referred to in the last chapter occurred\r\nabout a week after the first. I had again left my boat at the wharf\r\nbelow Bridge; the time was an hour earlier in the afternoon; and,\r\nundecided where to dine, I had strolled up into Cheapside, and was\r\nstrolling along it, surely the most unsettled person in all the busy\r\nconcourse, when a large hand was laid upon my shoulder by some one\r\novertaking me. It was Mr. Jaggers\xe2\x80\x99s hand, and he passed it through my\r\narm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs we are going in the same direction, Pip, we may walk together. Where\r\nare you bound for?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor the Temple, I think,\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you know?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Jaggers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d I returned, glad for once to get the better of him in\r\ncross-examination, \xe2\x80\x9cI do not know, for I have not made up my mind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are going to dine?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Jaggers. \xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t mind admitting\r\nthat, I suppose?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d I returned, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t mind admitting that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd are not engaged?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t mind admitting also that I am not engaged.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Jaggers, \xe2\x80\x9ccome and dine with me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI was going to excuse myself, when he added, \xe2\x80\x9cWemmick\xe2\x80\x99s coming.\xe2\x80\x9d So\r\nI changed my excuse into an acceptance,--the few words I had uttered,\r\nserving for the beginning of either,--and we went along Cheapside\r\nand slanted off to Little Britain, while the lights were springing up\r\nbrilliantly in the shop windows, and the street lamp-lighters, scarcely\r\nfinding ground enough to plant their ladders on in the midst of the\r\nafternoon\xe2\x80\x99s bustle, were skipping up and down and running in and out,\r\nopening more red eyes in the gathering fog than my rushlight tower at\r\nthe Hummums had opened white eyes in the ghostly wall.\r\n\r\nAt the office in Little Britain there was the usual letter-writing,\r\nhand-washing, candle-snuffing, and safe-locking, that closed the\r\nbusiness of the day. As I stood idle by Mr. Jaggers\xe2\x80\x99s fire, its rising\r\nand falling flame made the two casts on the shelf look as if they were\r\nplaying a diabolical game at bo-peep with me; while the pair of coarse,\r\nfat office candles that dimly lighted Mr. Jaggers as he wrote in a\r\ncorner were decorated with dirty winding-sheets, as if in remembrance of\r\na host of hanged clients.\r\n\r\nWe went to Gerrard Street, all three together, in a hackney-coach: And,\r\nas soon as we got there, dinner was served. Although I should not have\r\nthought of making, in that place, the most distant reference by so much\r\nas a look to Wemmick\xe2\x80\x99s Walworth sentiments, yet I should have had no\r\nobjection to catching his eye now and then in a friendly way. But it\r\nwas not to be done. He turned his eyes on Mr. Jaggers whenever he raised\r\nthem from the table, and was as dry and distant to me as if there were\r\ntwin Wemmicks, and this was the wrong one.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you send that note of Miss Havisham\xe2\x80\x99s to Mr. Pip, Wemmick?\xe2\x80\x9d Mr.\r\nJaggers asked, soon after we began dinner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Wemmick; \xe2\x80\x9cit was going by post, when you brought Mr.\r\nPip into the office. Here it is.\xe2\x80\x9d He handed it to his principal instead\r\nof to me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a note of two lines, Pip,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Jaggers, handing it on, \xe2\x80\x9csent\r\nup to me by Miss Havisham on account of her not being sure of your\r\naddress. She tells me that she wants to see you on a little matter of\r\nbusiness you mentioned to her. You\xe2\x80\x99ll go down?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, casting my eyes over the note, which was exactly in those\r\nterms.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen do you think of going down?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have an impending engagement,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, glancing at Wemmick, who was\r\nputting fish into the post-office, \xe2\x80\x9cthat renders me rather uncertain of\r\nmy time. At once, I think.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf Mr. Pip has the intention of going at once,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wemmick to Mr.\r\nJaggers, \xe2\x80\x9che needn\xe2\x80\x99t write an answer, you know.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nReceiving this as an intimation that it was best not to delay, I settled\r\nthat I would go to-morrow, and said so. Wemmick drank a glass of wine,\r\nand looked with a grimly satisfied air at Mr. Jaggers, but not at me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo, Pip! Our friend the Spider,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Jaggers, \xe2\x80\x9chas played his\r\ncards. He has won the pool.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was as much as I could do to assent.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHah! He is a promising fellow--in his way--but he may not have it all\r\nhis own way. The stronger will win in the end, but the stronger has to\r\nbe found out first. If he should turn to, and beat her--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSurely,\xe2\x80\x9d I interrupted, with a burning face and heart, \xe2\x80\x9cyou do not\r\nseriously think that he is scoundrel enough for that, Mr. Jaggers?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t say so, Pip. I am putting a case. If he should turn to and\r\nbeat her, he may possibly get the strength on his side; if it should be\r\na question of intellect, he certainly will not. It would be chance\r\nwork to give an opinion how a fellow of that sort will turn out in such\r\ncircumstances, because it\xe2\x80\x99s a toss-up between two results.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMay I ask what they are?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA fellow like our friend the Spider,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Mr. Jaggers, \xe2\x80\x9ceither\r\nbeats or cringes. He may cringe and growl, or cringe and not growl; but\r\nhe either beats or cringes. Ask Wemmick his opinion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEither beats or cringes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wemmick, not at all addressing himself\r\nto me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo here\xe2\x80\x99s to Mrs. Bentley Drummle,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Jaggers, taking a decanter\r\nof choicer wine from his dumb-waiter, and filling for each of us and\r\nfor himself, \xe2\x80\x9cand may the question of supremacy be settled to the lady\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsatisfaction! To the satisfaction of the lady and the gentleman,\r\nit never will be. Now, Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly, how slow you are\r\nto-day!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was at his elbow when he addressed her, putting a dish upon the\r\ntable. As she withdrew her hands from it, she fell back a step or two,\r\nnervously muttering some excuse. And a certain action of her fingers, as\r\nshe spoke, arrested my attention.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the matter?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Jaggers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing. Only the subject we were speaking of,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cwas rather\r\npainful to me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe action of her fingers was like the action of knitting. She stood\r\nlooking at her master, not understanding whether she was free to go, or\r\nwhether he had more to say to her and would call her back if she did go.\r\nHer look was very intent. Surely, I had seen exactly such eyes and such\r\nhands on a memorable occasion very lately!\r\n\r\nHe dismissed her, and she glided out of the room. But she remained\r\nbefore me as plainly as if she were still there. I looked at those\r\nhands, I looked at those eyes, I looked at that flowing hair; and I\r\ncompared them with other hands, other eyes, other hair, that I knew of,\r\nand with what those might be after twenty years of a brutal husband\r\nand a stormy life. I looked again at those hands and eyes of the\r\nhousekeeper, and thought of the inexplicable feeling that had come over\r\nme when I last walked--not alone--in the ruined garden, and through the\r\ndeserted brewery. I thought how the same feeling had come back when I\r\nsaw a face looking at me, and a hand waving to me from a stage-coach\r\nwindow; and how it had come back again and had flashed about me like\r\nlightning, when I had passed in a carriage--not alone--through a sudden\r\nglare of light in a dark street. I thought how one link of association\r\nhad helped that identification in the theatre, and how such a link,\r\nwanting before, had been riveted for me now, when I had passed by a\r\nchance swift from Estella\xe2\x80\x99s name to the fingers with their knitting\r\naction, and the attentive eyes. And I felt absolutely certain that this\r\nwoman was Estella\xe2\x80\x99s mother.\r\n\r\nMr. Jaggers had seen me with Estella, and was not likely to have missed\r\nthe sentiments I had been at no pains to conceal. He nodded when I said\r\nthe subject was painful to me, clapped me on the back, put round the\r\nwine again, and went on with his dinner.\r\n\r\nOnly twice more did the housekeeper reappear, and then her stay in the\r\nroom was very short, and Mr. Jaggers was sharp with her. But her hands\r\nwere Estella\xe2\x80\x99s hands, and her eyes were Estella\xe2\x80\x99s eyes, and if she had\r\nreappeared a hundred times I could have been neither more sure nor less\r\nsure that my conviction was the truth.\r\n\r\nIt was a dull evening, for Wemmick drew his wine, when it came round,\r\nquite as a matter of business,--just as he might have drawn his salary\r\nwhen that came round,--and with his eyes on his chief, sat in a state of\r\nperpetual readiness for cross-examination. As to the quantity of wine,\r\nhis post-office was as indifferent and ready as any other post-office\r\nfor its quantity of letters. From my point of view, he was the wrong\r\ntwin all the time, and only externally like the Wemmick of Walworth.\r\n\r\nWe took our leave early, and left together. Even when we were groping\r\namong Mr. Jaggers\xe2\x80\x99s stock of boots for our hats, I felt that the right\r\ntwin was on his way back; and we had not gone half a dozen yards down\r\nGerrard Street in the Walworth direction, before I found that I was\r\nwalking arm in arm with the right twin, and that the wrong twin had\r\nevaporated into the evening air.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell!\xe2\x80\x9d said Wemmick, \xe2\x80\x9cthat\xe2\x80\x99s over! He\xe2\x80\x99s a wonderful man, without his\r\nliving likeness; but I feel that I have to screw myself up when I dine\r\nwith him,--and I dine more comfortably unscrewed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI felt that this was a good statement of the case, and told him so.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWouldn\xe2\x80\x99t say it to anybody but yourself,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered. \xe2\x80\x9cI know that\r\nwhat is said between you and me goes no further.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI asked him if he had ever seen Miss Havisham\xe2\x80\x99s adopted daughter, Mrs.\r\nBentley Drummle. He said no. To avoid being too abrupt, I then spoke\r\nof the Aged and of Miss Skiffins. He looked rather sly when I mentioned\r\nMiss Skiffins, and stopped in the street to blow his nose, with a roll\r\nof the head, and a flourish not quite free from latent boastfulness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWemmick,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cdo you remember telling me, before I first went to\r\nMr. Jaggers\xe2\x80\x99s private house, to notice that housekeeper?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid I?\xe2\x80\x9d he replied. \xe2\x80\x9cAh, I dare say I did. Deuce take me,\xe2\x80\x9d he added,\r\nsuddenly, \xe2\x80\x9cI know I did. I find I am not quite unscrewed yet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA wild beast tamed, you called her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what do you call her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe same. How did Mr. Jaggers tame her, Wemmick?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s his secret. She has been with him many a long year.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI wish you would tell me her story. I feel a particular interest in\r\nbeing acquainted with it. You know that what is said between you and me\r\ngoes no further.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell!\xe2\x80\x9d Wemmick replied, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know her story,--that is, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know\r\nall of it. But what I do know I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you. We are in our private and\r\npersonal capacities, of course.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA score or so of years ago, that woman was tried at the Old Bailey for\r\nmurder, and was acquitted. She was a very handsome young woman, and I\r\nbelieve had some gypsy blood in her. Anyhow, it was hot enough when it\r\nwas up, as you may suppose.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut she was acquitted.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Jaggers was for her,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued Wemmick, with a look full of meaning,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cand worked the case in a way quite astonishing. It was a desperate\r\ncase, and it was comparatively early days with him then, and he worked\r\nit to general admiration; in fact, it may almost be said to have made\r\nhim. He worked it himself at the police-office, day after day for many\r\ndays, contending against even a committal; and at the trial where he\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t work it himself, sat under counsel, and--every one knew--put\r\nin all the salt and pepper. The murdered person was a woman,--a woman a\r\ngood ten years older, very much larger, and very much stronger. It was\r\na case of jealousy. They both led tramping lives, and this woman in\r\nGerrard Street here had been married very young, over the broomstick (as\r\nwe say), to a tramping man, and was a perfect fury in point of jealousy.\r\nThe murdered woman,--more a match for the man, certainly, in point of\r\nyears--was found dead in a barn near Hounslow Heath. There had been a\r\nviolent struggle, perhaps a fight. She was bruised and scratched and\r\ntorn, and had been held by the throat, at last, and choked. Now, there\r\nwas no reasonable evidence to implicate any person but this woman, and\r\non the improbabilities of her having been able to do it Mr. Jaggers\r\nprincipally rested his case. You may be sure,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wemmick, touching me\r\non the sleeve, \xe2\x80\x9cthat he never dwelt upon the strength of her hands then,\r\nthough he sometimes does now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI had told Wemmick of his showing us her wrists, that day of the dinner\r\nparty.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, sir!\xe2\x80\x9d Wemmick went on; \xe2\x80\x9cit happened--happened, don\xe2\x80\x99t you\r\nsee?--that this woman was so very artfully dressed from the time of\r\nher apprehension, that she looked much slighter than she really was; in\r\nparticular, her sleeves are always remembered to have been so skilfully\r\ncontrived that her arms had quite a delicate look. She had only a bruise\r\nor two about her,--nothing for a tramp,--but the backs of her hands\r\nwere lacerated, and the question was, Was it with finger-nails? Now, Mr.\r\nJaggers showed that she had struggled through a great lot of brambles\r\nwhich were not as high as her face; but which she could not have got\r\nthrough and kept her hands out of; and bits of those brambles were\r\nactually found in her skin and put in evidence, as well as the fact that\r\nthe brambles in question were found on examination to have been broken\r\nthrough, and to have little shreds of her dress and little spots of\r\nblood upon them here and there. But the boldest point he made was this:\r\nit was attempted to be set up, in proof of her jealousy, that she was\r\nunder strong suspicion of having, at about the time of the murder,\r\nfrantically destroyed her child by this man--some three years old--to\r\nrevenge herself upon him. Mr. Jaggers worked that in this way: \xe2\x80\x9cWe say\r\nthese are not marks of finger-nails, but marks of brambles, and we show\r\nyou the brambles. You say they are marks of finger-nails, and you set\r\nup the hypothesis that she destroyed her child. You must accept all\r\nconsequences of that hypothesis. For anything we know, she may have\r\ndestroyed her child, and the child in clinging to her may have scratched\r\nher hands. What then? You are not trying her for the murder of her\r\nchild; why don\xe2\x80\x99t you? As to this case, if you will have scratches,\r\nwe say that, for anything we know, you may have accounted for them,\r\nassuming for the sake of argument that you have not invented them?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cTo\r\nsum up, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wemmick, \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Jaggers was altogether too many for the\r\njury, and they gave in.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHas she been in his service ever since?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes; but not only that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wemmick, \xe2\x80\x9cshe went into his service\r\nimmediately after her acquittal, tamed as she is now. She has since been\r\ntaught one thing and another in the way of her duties, but she was tamed\r\nfrom the beginning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you remember the sex of the child?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSaid to have been a girl.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have nothing more to say to me to-night?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing. I got your letter and destroyed it. Nothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe exchanged a cordial good-night, and I went home, with new matter for\r\nmy thoughts, though with no relief from the old.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XLIX\r\n\r\nPutting Miss Havisham\xe2\x80\x99s note in my pocket, that it might serve as\r\nmy credentials for so soon reappearing at Satis House, in case her\r\nwaywardness should lead her to express any surprise at seeing me, I went\r\ndown again by the coach next day. But I alighted at the Halfway House,\r\nand breakfasted there, and walked the rest of the distance; for I sought\r\nto get into the town quietly by the unfrequented ways, and to leave it\r\nin the same manner.\r\n\r\nThe best light of the day was gone when I passed along the quiet echoing\r\ncourts behind the High Street. The nooks of ruin where the old monks had\r\nonce had their refectories and gardens, and where the strong walls were\r\nnow pressed into the service of humble sheds and stables, were almost\r\nas silent as the old monks in their graves. The cathedral chimes had at\r\nonce a sadder and a more remote sound to me, as I hurried on avoiding\r\nobservation, than they had ever had before; so, the swell of the old\r\norgan was borne to my ears like funeral music; and the rooks, as they\r\nhovered about the gray tower and swung in the bare high trees of the\r\npriory garden, seemed to call to me that the place was changed, and that\r\nEstella was gone out of it for ever.\r\n\r\nAn elderly woman, whom I had seen before as one of the servants who\r\nlived in the supplementary house across the back courtyard, opened the\r\ngate. The lighted candle stood in the dark passage within, as of old,\r\nand I took it up and ascended the staircase alone. Miss Havisham was not\r\nin her own room, but was in the larger room across the landing. Looking\r\nin at the door, after knocking in vain, I saw her sitting on the hearth\r\nin a ragged chair, close before, and lost in the contemplation of, the\r\nashy fire.\r\n\r\nDoing as I had often done, I went in, and stood touching the old\r\nchimney-piece, where she could see me when she raised her eyes. There\r\nwas an air of utter loneliness upon her, that would have moved me to\r\npity though she had wilfully done me a deeper injury than I could charge\r\nher with. As I stood compassionating her, and thinking how, in the\r\nprogress of time, I too had come to be a part of the wrecked fortunes of\r\nthat house, her eyes rested on me. She stared, and said in a low voice,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it real?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is I, Pip. Mr. Jaggers gave me your note yesterday, and I have lost\r\nno time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you. Thank you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs I brought another of the ragged chairs to the hearth and sat down, I\r\nremarked a new expression on her face, as if she were afraid of me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cto pursue that subject you mentioned to me when you\r\nwere last here, and to show you that I am not all stone. But perhaps you\r\ncan never believe, now, that there is anything human in my heart?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen I said some reassuring words, she stretched out her tremulous right\r\nhand, as though she was going to touch me; but she recalled it again\r\nbefore I understood the action, or knew how to receive it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou said, speaking for your friend, that you could tell me how to do\r\nsomething useful and good. Something that you would like done, is it\r\nnot?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSomething that I would like done very much.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI began explaining to her that secret history of the partnership. I had\r\nnot got far into it, when I judged from her looks that she was thinking\r\nin a discursive way of me, rather than of what I said. It seemed to be\r\nso; for, when I stopped speaking, many moments passed before she showed\r\nthat she was conscious of the fact.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you break off,\xe2\x80\x9d she asked then, with her former air of being afraid\r\nof me, \xe2\x80\x9cbecause you hate me too much to bear to speak to me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no,\xe2\x80\x9d I answered, \xe2\x80\x9chow can you think so, Miss Havisham! I stopped\r\nbecause I thought you were not following what I said.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps I was not,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered, putting a hand to her head. \xe2\x80\x9cBegin\r\nagain, and let me look at something else. Stay! Now tell me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe set her hand upon her stick in the resolute way that sometimes was\r\nhabitual to her, and looked at the fire with a strong expression of\r\nforcing herself to attend. I went on with my explanation, and told her\r\nhow I had hoped to complete the transaction out of my means, but how\r\nin this I was disappointed. That part of the subject (I reminded her)\r\ninvolved matters which could form no part of my explanation, for they\r\nwere the weighty secrets of another.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo!\xe2\x80\x9d said she, assenting with her head, but not looking at me. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd how\r\nmuch money is wanting to complete the purchase?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI was rather afraid of stating it, for it sounded a large sum. \xe2\x80\x9cNine\r\nhundred pounds.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf I give you the money for this purpose, will you keep my secret as\r\nyou have kept your own?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite as faithfully.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd your mind will be more at rest?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMuch more at rest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you very unhappy now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe asked this question, still without looking at me, but in an unwonted\r\ntone of sympathy. I could not reply at the moment, for my voice failed\r\nme. She put her left arm across the head of her stick, and softly laid\r\nher forehead on it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am far from happy, Miss Havisham; but I have other causes of disquiet\r\nthan any you know of. They are the secrets I have mentioned.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter a little while, she raised her head, and looked at the fire again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is noble in you to tell me that you have other causes of\r\nunhappiness. Is it true?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cToo true.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCan I only serve you, Pip, by serving your friend? Regarding that as\r\ndone, is there nothing I can do for you yourself?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNothing. I thank you for the question. I thank you even more for the\r\ntone of the question. But there is nothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe presently rose from her seat, and looked about the blighted room\r\nfor the means of writing. There were none there, and she took from her\r\npocket a yellow set of ivory tablets, mounted in tarnished gold, and\r\nwrote upon them with a pencil in a case of tarnished gold that hung from\r\nher neck.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are still on friendly terms with Mr. Jaggers?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite. I dined with him yesterday.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is an authority to him to pay you that money, to lay out at your\r\nirresponsible discretion for your friend. I keep no money here; but if\r\nyou would rather Mr. Jaggers knew nothing of the matter, I will send it\r\nto you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you, Miss Havisham; I have not the least objection to receiving\r\nit from him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe read me what she had written; and it was direct and clear, and\r\nevidently intended to absolve me from any suspicion of profiting by the\r\nreceipt of the money. I took the tablets from her hand, and it trembled\r\nagain, and it trembled more as she took off the chain to which the\r\npencil was attached, and put it in mine. All this she did without\r\nlooking at me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy name is on the first leaf. If you can ever write under my name, \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nforgive her,\xe2\x80\x9d though ever so long after my broken heart is dust pray do\r\nit!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO Miss Havisham,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cI can do it now. There have been sore\r\nmistakes; and my life has been a blind and thankless one; and I want\r\nforgiveness and direction far too much, to be bitter with you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe turned her face to me for the first time since she had averted it,\r\nand, to my amazement, I may even add to my terror, dropped on her knees\r\nat my feet; with her folded hands raised to me in the manner in which,\r\nwhen her poor heart was young and fresh and whole, they must often have\r\nbeen raised to heaven from her mother\xe2\x80\x99s side.\r\n\r\nTo see her with her white hair and her worn face kneeling at my feet\r\ngave me a shock through all my frame. I entreated her to rise, and got\r\nmy arms about her to help her up; but she only pressed that hand of mine\r\nwhich was nearest to her grasp, and hung her head over it and wept. I\r\nhad never seen her shed a tear before, and, in the hope that the\r\nrelief might do her good, I bent over her without speaking. She was not\r\nkneeling now, but was down upon the ground.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO!\xe2\x80\x9d she cried, despairingly. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat have I done! What have I done!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you mean, Miss Havisham, what have you done to injure me, let me\r\nanswer. Very little. I should have loved her under any circumstances. Is\r\nshe married?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was a needless question, for a new desolation in the desolate house\r\nhad told me so.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat have I done! What have I done!\xe2\x80\x9d She wrung her hands, and crushed\r\nher white hair, and returned to this cry over and over again. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat have\r\nI done!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI knew not how to answer, or how to comfort her. That she had done a\r\ngrievous thing in taking an impressionable child to mould into the form\r\nthat her wild resentment, spurned affection, and wounded pride found\r\nvengeance in, I knew full well. But that, in shutting out the light\r\nof day, she had shut out infinitely more; that, in seclusion, she had\r\nsecluded herself from a thousand natural and healing influences; that,\r\nher mind, brooding solitary, had grown diseased, as all minds do and\r\nmust and will that reverse the appointed order of their Maker, I knew\r\nequally well. And could I look upon her without compassion, seeing her\r\npunishment in the ruin she was, in her profound unfitness for this earth\r\non which she was placed, in the vanity of sorrow which had become a\r\nmaster mania, like the vanity of penitence, the vanity of remorse, the\r\nvanity of unworthiness, and other monstrous vanities that have been\r\ncurses in this world?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUntil you spoke to her the other day, and until I saw in you a\r\nlooking-glass that showed me what I once felt myself, I did not know\r\nwhat I had done. What have I done! What have I done!\xe2\x80\x9d And so again,\r\ntwenty, fifty times over, What had she done!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Havisham,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, when her cry had died away, \xe2\x80\x9cyou may dismiss me\r\nfrom your mind and conscience. But Estella is a different case, and if\r\nyou can ever undo any scrap of what you have done amiss in keeping a\r\npart of her right nature away from her, it will be better to do that\r\nthan to bemoan the past through a hundred years.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes, I know it. But, Pip--my dear!\xe2\x80\x9d There was an earnest womanly\r\ncompassion for me in her new affection. \xe2\x80\x9cMy dear! Believe this: when she\r\nfirst came to me, I meant to save her from misery like my own. At first,\r\nI meant no more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, well!\xe2\x80\x9d said I. \xe2\x80\x9cI hope so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut as she grew, and promised to be very beautiful, I gradually did\r\nworse, and with my praises, and with my jewels, and with my teachings,\r\nand with this figure of myself always before her, a warning to back and\r\npoint my lessons, I stole her heart away, and put ice in its place.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBetter,\xe2\x80\x9d I could not help saying, \xe2\x80\x9cto have left her a natural heart,\r\neven to be bruised or broken.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith that, Miss Havisham looked distractedly at me for a while, and then\r\nburst out again, What had she done!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you knew all my story,\xe2\x80\x9d she pleaded, \xe2\x80\x9cyou would have some compassion\r\nfor me and a better understanding of me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Havisham,\xe2\x80\x9d I answered, as delicately as I could, \xe2\x80\x9cI believe I may\r\nsay that I do know your story, and have known it ever since I first left\r\nthis neighborhood. It has inspired me with great commiseration, and I\r\nhope I understand it and its influences. Does what has passed between us\r\ngive me any excuse for asking you a question relative to Estella? Not as\r\nshe is, but as she was when she first came here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe was seated on the ground, with her arms on the ragged chair, and\r\nher head leaning on them. She looked full at me when I said this, and\r\nreplied, \xe2\x80\x9cGo on.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhose child was Estella?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe shook her head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t know?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe shook her head again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut Mr. Jaggers brought her here, or sent her here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBrought her here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWill you tell me how that came about?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nShe answered in a low whisper and with caution: \xe2\x80\x9cI had been shut up in\r\nthese rooms a long time (I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how long; you know what time the\r\nclocks keep here), when I told him that I wanted a little girl to rear\r\nand love, and save from my fate. I had first seen him when I sent\r\nfor him to lay this place waste for me; having read of him in the\r\nnewspapers, before I and the world parted. He told me that he would\r\nlook about him for such an orphan child. One night he brought her here\r\nasleep, and I called her Estella.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMight I ask her age then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwo or three. She herself knows nothing, but that she was left an\r\norphan and I adopted her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo convinced I was of that woman\xe2\x80\x99s being her mother, that I wanted\r\nno evidence to establish the fact in my own mind. But, to any mind, I\r\nthought, the connection here was clear and straight.\r\n\r\nWhat more could I hope to do by prolonging the interview? I had\r\nsucceeded on behalf of Herbert, Miss Havisham had told me all she knew\r\nof Estella, I had said and done what I could to ease her mind. No matter\r\nwith what other words we parted; we parted.\r\n\r\nTwilight was closing in when I went downstairs into the natural air. I\r\ncalled to the woman who had opened the gate when I entered, that I would\r\nnot trouble her just yet, but would walk round the place before leaving.\r\nFor I had a presentiment that I should never be there again, and I felt\r\nthat the dying light was suited to my last view of it.\r\n\r\nBy the wilderness of casks that I had walked on long ago, and on which\r\nthe rain of years had fallen since, rotting them in many places, and\r\nleaving miniature swamps and pools of water upon those that stood on\r\nend, I made my way to the ruined garden. I went all round it; round by\r\nthe corner where Herbert and I had fought our battle; round by the paths\r\nwhere Estella and I had walked. So cold, so lonely, so dreary all!\r\n\r\nTaking the brewery on my way back, I raised the rusty latch of a little\r\ndoor at the garden end of it, and walked through. I was going out at the\r\nopposite door,--not easy to open now, for the damp wood had started and\r\nswelled, and the hinges were yielding, and the threshold was encumbered\r\nwith a growth of fungus,--when I turned my head to look back. A childish\r\nassociation revived with wonderful force in the moment of the slight\r\naction, and I fancied that I saw Miss Havisham hanging to the beam. So\r\nstrong was the impression, that I stood under the beam shuddering from\r\nhead to foot before I knew it was a fancy,--though to be sure I was\r\nthere in an instant.\r\n\r\nThe mournfulness of the place and time, and the great terror of\r\nthis illusion, though it was but momentary, caused me to feel an\r\nindescribable awe as I came out between the open wooden gates where I\r\nhad once wrung my hair after Estella had wrung my heart. Passing on into\r\nthe front courtyard, I hesitated whether to call the woman to let me out\r\nat the locked gate of which she had the key, or first to go upstairs\r\nand assure myself that Miss Havisham was as safe and well as I had left\r\nher. I took the latter course and went up.\r\n\r\nI looked into the room where I had left her, and I saw her seated in the\r\nragged chair upon the hearth close to the fire, with her back towards\r\nme. In the moment when I was withdrawing my head to go quietly away,\r\nI saw a great flaming light spring up. In the same moment I saw her\r\nrunning at me, shrieking, with a whirl of fire blazing all about her,\r\nand soaring at least as many feet above her head as she was high.\r\n\r\nI had a double-caped great-coat on, and over my arm another thick coat.\r\nThat I got them off, closed with her, threw her down, and got them over\r\nher; that I dragged the great cloth from the table for the same purpose,\r\nand with it dragged down the heap of rottenness in the midst, and\r\nall the ugly things that sheltered there; that we were on the ground\r\nstruggling like desperate enemies, and that the closer I covered her,\r\nthe more wildly she shrieked and tried to free herself,--that this\r\noccurred I knew through the result, but not through anything I felt, or\r\nthought, or knew I did. I knew nothing until I knew that we were on the\r\nfloor by the great table, and that patches of tinder yet alight were\r\nfloating in the smoky air, which, a moment ago, had been her faded\r\nbridal dress.\r\n\r\nThen, I looked round and saw the disturbed beetles and spiders running\r\naway over the floor, and the servants coming in with breathless cries\r\nat the door. I still held her forcibly down with all my strength, like\r\na prisoner who might escape; and I doubt if I even knew who she was, or\r\nwhy we had struggled, or that she had been in flames, or that the flames\r\nwere out, until I saw the patches of tinder that had been her garments\r\nno longer alight but falling in a black shower around us.\r\n\r\nShe was insensible, and I was afraid to have her moved, or even\r\ntouched. Assistance was sent for, and I held her until it came, as if\r\nI unreasonably fancied (I think I did) that, if I let her go, the fire\r\nwould break out again and consume her. When I got up, on the surgeon\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncoming to her with other aid, I was astonished to see that both my hands\r\nwere burnt; for, I had no knowledge of it through the sense of feeling.\r\n\r\nOn examination it was pronounced that she had received serious hurts,\r\nbut that they of themselves were far from hopeless; the danger lay\r\nmainly in the nervous shock. By the surgeon\xe2\x80\x99s directions, her bed was\r\ncarried into that room and laid upon the great table, which happened to\r\nbe well suited to the dressing of her injuries. When I saw her again, an\r\nhour afterwards, she lay, indeed, where I had seen her strike her stick,\r\nand had heard her say that she would lie one day.\r\n\r\nThough every vestige of her dress was burnt, as they told me, she\r\nstill had something of her old ghastly bridal appearance; for, they had\r\ncovered her to the throat with white cotton-wool, and as she lay with\r\na white sheet loosely overlying that, the phantom air of something that\r\nhad been and was changed was still upon her.\r\n\r\nI found, on questioning the servants, that Estella was in Paris, and I\r\ngot a promise from the surgeon that he would write to her by the\r\nnext post. Miss Havisham\xe2\x80\x99s family I took upon myself; intending to\r\ncommunicate with Mr. Matthew Pocket only, and leave him to do as he\r\nliked about informing the rest. This I did next day, through Herbert, as\r\nsoon as I returned to town.\r\n\r\nThere was a stage, that evening, when she spoke collectedly of what had\r\nhappened, though with a certain terrible vivacity. Towards midnight she\r\nbegan to wander in her speech; and after that it gradually set in that\r\nshe said innumerable times in a low solemn voice, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat have I done!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n And then, \xe2\x80\x9cWhen she first came, I meant to save her from misery like\r\nmine.\xe2\x80\x9d And then, \xe2\x80\x9cTake the pencil and write under my name, \xe2\x80\x98I forgive\r\nher!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d She never changed the order of these three sentences, but she\r\nsometimes left out a word in one or other of them; never putting in\r\nanother word, but always leaving a blank and going on to the next word.\r\n\r\nAs I could do no service there, and as I had, nearer home, that pressing\r\nreason for anxiety and fear which even her wanderings could not drive\r\nout of my mind, I decided, in the course of the night that I would\r\nreturn by the early morning coach, walking on a mile or so, and being\r\ntaken up clear of the town. At about six o\xe2\x80\x99clock of the morning,\r\ntherefore, I leaned over her and touched her lips with mine, just as\r\nthey said, not stopping for being touched, \xe2\x80\x9cTake the pencil and write\r\nunder my name, \xe2\x80\x98I forgive her.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter L\r\n\r\nMy hands had been dressed twice or thrice in the night, and again in\r\nthe morning. My left arm was a good deal burned to the elbow, and, less\r\nseverely, as high as the shoulder; it was very painful, but the flames\r\nhad set in that direction, and I felt thankful it was no worse. My right\r\nhand was not so badly burnt but that I could move the fingers. It was\r\nbandaged, of course, but much less inconveniently than my left hand and\r\narm; those I carried in a sling; and I could only wear my coat like a\r\ncloak, loose over my shoulders and fastened at the neck. My hair had\r\nbeen caught by the fire, but not my head or face.\r\n\r\nWhen Herbert had been down to Hammersmith and seen his father, he came\r\nback to me at our chambers, and devoted the day to attending on me. He\r\nwas the kindest of nurses, and at stated times took off the bandages,\r\nand steeped them in the cooling liquid that was kept ready, and put them\r\non again, with a patient tenderness that I was deeply grateful for.\r\n\r\nAt first, as I lay quiet on the sofa, I found it painfully difficult, I\r\nmight say impossible, to get rid of the impression of the glare of the\r\nflames, their hurry and noise, and the fierce burning smell. If I\r\ndozed for a minute, I was awakened by Miss Havisham\xe2\x80\x99s cries, and by her\r\nrunning at me with all that height of fire above her head. This pain\r\nof the mind was much harder to strive against than any bodily pain I\r\nsuffered; and Herbert, seeing that, did his utmost to hold my attention\r\nengaged.\r\n\r\nNeither of us spoke of the boat, but we both thought of it. That\r\nwas made apparent by our avoidance of the subject, and by our\r\nagreeing--without agreement--to make my recovery of the use of my hands\r\na question of so many hours, not of so many weeks.\r\n\r\nMy first question when I saw Herbert had been of course, whether all\r\nwas well down the river? As he replied in the affirmative, with perfect\r\nconfidence and cheerfulness, we did not resume the subject until the day\r\nwas wearing away. But then, as Herbert changed the bandages, more by\r\nthe light of the fire than by the outer light, he went back to it\r\nspontaneously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI sat with Provis last night, Handel, two good hours.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere was Clara?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear little thing!\xe2\x80\x9d said Herbert. \xe2\x80\x9cShe was up and down with\r\nGruffandgrim all the evening. He was perpetually pegging at the floor\r\nthe moment she left his sight. I doubt if he can hold out long, though.\r\nWhat with rum and pepper,--and pepper and rum,--I should think his\r\npegging must be nearly over.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd then you will be married, Herbert?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow can I take care of the dear child otherwise?--Lay your arm out upon\r\nthe back of the sofa, my dear boy, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll sit down here, and get the\r\nbandage off so gradually that you shall not know when it comes. I was\r\nspeaking of Provis. Do you know, Handel, he improves?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI said to you I thought he was softened when I last saw him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo you did. And so he is. He was very communicative last night, and\r\ntold me more of his life. You remember his breaking off here about some\r\nwoman that he had had great trouble with.--Did I hurt you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI had started, but not under his touch. His words had given me a start.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had forgotten that, Herbert, but I remember it now you speak of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell! He went into that part of his life, and a dark wild part it is.\r\nShall I tell you? Or would it worry you just now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell me by all means. Every word.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHerbert bent forward to look at me more nearly, as if my reply had been\r\nrather more hurried or more eager than he could quite account for. \xe2\x80\x9cYour\r\nhead is cool?\xe2\x80\x9d he said, touching it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite,\xe2\x80\x9d said I. \xe2\x80\x9cTell me what Provis said, my dear Herbert.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt seems,\xe2\x80\x9d said Herbert, \xe2\x80\x9c--there\xe2\x80\x99s a bandage off most charmingly, and\r\nnow comes the cool one,--makes you shrink at first, my poor dear fellow,\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t it? but it will be comfortable presently,--it seems that the\r\nwoman was a young woman, and a jealous woman, and a revengeful woman;\r\nrevengeful, Handel, to the last degree.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTo what last degree?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMurder.--Does it strike too cold on that sensitive place?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t feel it. How did she murder? Whom did she murder?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, the deed may not have merited quite so terrible a name,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n said Herbert, \xe2\x80\x9cbut, she was tried for it, and Mr. Jaggers defended\r\nher, and the reputation of that defence first made his name known\r\nto Provis. It was another and a stronger woman who was the victim,\r\nand there had been a struggle--in a barn. Who began it, or how fair\r\nit was, or how unfair, may be doubtful; but how it ended is\r\ncertainly not doubtful, for the victim was found throttled.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWas the woman brought in guilty?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo; she was acquitted.--My poor Handel, I hurt you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is impossible to be gentler, Herbert. Yes? What else?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis acquitted young woman and Provis had a little child; a little\r\nchild of whom Provis was exceedingly fond. On the evening of the very\r\nnight when the object of her jealousy was strangled as I tell you, the\r\nyoung woman presented herself before Provis for one moment, and swore\r\nthat she would destroy the child (which was in her possession), and he\r\nshould never see it again; then she vanished.--There\xe2\x80\x99s the worst arm\r\ncomfortably in the sling once more, and now there remains but the right\r\nhand, which is a far easier job. I can do it better by this light\r\nthan by a stronger, for my hand is steadiest when I don\xe2\x80\x99t see the poor\r\nblistered patches too distinctly.--You don\xe2\x80\x99t think your breathing is\r\naffected, my dear boy? You seem to breathe quickly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps I do, Herbert. Did the woman keep her oath?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere comes the darkest part of Provis\xe2\x80\x99s life. She did.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat is, he says she did.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, of course, my dear boy,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Herbert, in a tone of surprise,\r\nand again bending forward to get a nearer look at me. \xe2\x80\x9cHe says it all. I\r\nhave no other information.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, to be sure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, whether,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued Herbert, \xe2\x80\x9che had used the child\xe2\x80\x99s mother ill, or\r\nwhether he had used the child\xe2\x80\x99s mother well, Provis doesn\xe2\x80\x99t say; but she\r\nhad shared some four or five years of the wretched life he described\r\nto us at this fireside, and he seems to have felt pity for her, and\r\nforbearance towards her. Therefore, fearing he should be called upon to\r\ndepose about this destroyed child, and so be the cause of her death, he\r\nhid himself (much as he grieved for the child), kept himself dark, as he\r\nsays, out of the way and out of the trial, and was only vaguely talked\r\nof as a certain man called Abel, out of whom the jealousy arose. After\r\nthe acquittal she disappeared, and thus he lost the child and the\r\nchild\xe2\x80\x99s mother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want to ask--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA moment, my dear boy, and I have done. That evil genius, Compeyson,\r\nthe worst of scoundrels among many scoundrels, knowing of his keeping\r\nout of the way at that time and of his reasons for doing so, of course\r\nafterwards held the knowledge over his head as a means of keeping him\r\npoorer and working him harder. It was clear last night that this barbed\r\nthe point of Provis\xe2\x80\x99s animosity.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want to know,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cand particularly, Herbert, whether he told\r\nyou when this happened?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cParticularly? Let me remember, then, what he said as to that. His\r\nexpression was, \xe2\x80\x98a round score o\xe2\x80\x99 year ago, and a\xe2\x80\x99most directly after I\r\ntook up wi\xe2\x80\x99 Compeyson.\xe2\x80\x99 How old were you when you came upon him in the\r\nlittle churchyard?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think in my seventh year.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy. It had happened some three or four years then, he said, and you\r\nbrought into his mind the little girl so tragically lost, who would have\r\nbeen about your age.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHerbert,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, after a short silence, in a hurried way, \xe2\x80\x9ccan you see\r\nme best by the light of the window, or the light of the fire?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBy the firelight,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Herbert, coming close again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLook at me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do look at you, my dear boy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTouch me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do touch you, my dear boy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou are not afraid that I am in any fever, or that my head is much\r\ndisordered by the accident of last night?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cN-no, my dear boy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Herbert, after taking time to examine me. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\nare rather excited, but you are quite yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know I am quite myself. And the man we have in hiding down the river,\r\nis Estella\xe2\x80\x99s Father.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter LI\r\n\r\nWhat purpose I had in view when I was hot on tracing out and proving\r\nEstella\xe2\x80\x99s parentage, I cannot say. It will presently be seen that the\r\nquestion was not before me in a distinct shape until it was put before\r\nme by a wiser head than my own.\r\n\r\nBut when Herbert and I had held our momentous conversation, I was seized\r\nwith a feverish conviction that I ought to hunt the matter down,--that I\r\nought not to let it rest, but that I ought to see Mr. Jaggers, and come\r\nat the bare truth. I really do not know whether I felt that I did this\r\nfor Estella\xe2\x80\x99s sake, or whether I was glad to transfer to the man in\r\nwhose preservation I was so much concerned some rays of the romantic\r\ninterest that had so long surrounded me. Perhaps the latter possibility\r\nmay be the nearer to the truth.\r\n\r\nAny way, I could scarcely be withheld from going out to Gerrard Street\r\nthat night. Herbert\xe2\x80\x99s representations that, if I did, I should probably\r\nbe laid up and stricken useless, when our fugitive\xe2\x80\x99s safety would depend\r\nupon me, alone restrained my impatience. On the understanding, again\r\nand again reiterated, that, come what would, I was to go to Mr. Jaggers\r\nto-morrow, I at length submitted to keep quiet, and to have my hurts\r\nlooked after, and to stay at home. Early next morning we went out\r\ntogether, and at the corner of Giltspur Street by Smithfield, I left\r\nHerbert to go his way into the City, and took my way to Little Britain.\r\n\r\nThere were periodical occasions when Mr. Jaggers and Wemmick went over\r\nthe office accounts, and checked off the vouchers, and put all things\r\nstraight. On these occasions, Wemmick took his books and papers into Mr.\r\nJaggers\xe2\x80\x99s room, and one of the upstairs clerks came down into the outer\r\noffice. Finding such clerk on Wemmick\xe2\x80\x99s post that morning, I knew\r\nwhat was going on; but I was not sorry to have Mr. Jaggers and Wemmick\r\ntogether, as Wemmick would then hear for himself that I said nothing to\r\ncompromise him.\r\n\r\nMy appearance, with my arm bandaged and my coat loose over my shoulders,\r\nfavored my object. Although I had sent Mr. Jaggers a brief account of\r\nthe accident as soon as I had arrived in town, yet I had to give him all\r\nthe details now; and the speciality of the occasion caused our talk\r\nto be less dry and hard, and less strictly regulated by the rules of\r\nevidence, than it had been before. While I described the disaster, Mr.\r\nJaggers stood, according to his wont, before the fire. Wemmick leaned\r\nback in his chair, staring at me, with his hands in the pockets of his\r\ntrousers, and his pen put horizontally into the post. The two brutal\r\ncasts, always inseparable in my mind from the official proceedings,\r\nseemed to be congestively considering whether they didn\xe2\x80\x99t smell fire at\r\nthe present moment.\r\n\r\nMy narrative finished, and their questions exhausted, I then produced\r\nMiss Havisham\xe2\x80\x99s authority to receive the nine hundred pounds for\r\nHerbert. Mr. Jaggers\xe2\x80\x99s eyes retired a little deeper into his head when\r\nI handed him the tablets, but he presently handed them over to Wemmick,\r\nwith instructions to draw the check for his signature. While that was\r\nin course of being done, I looked on at Wemmick as he wrote, and Mr.\r\nJaggers, poising and swaying himself on his well-polished boots, looked\r\non at me. \xe2\x80\x9cI am sorry, Pip,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, as I put the check in my pocket,\r\nwhen he had signed it, \xe2\x80\x9cthat we do nothing for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Havisham was good enough to ask me,\xe2\x80\x9d I returned, \xe2\x80\x9cwhether she\r\ncould do nothing for me, and I told her No.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEverybody should know his own business,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Jaggers. And I saw\r\nWemmick\xe2\x80\x99s lips form the words \xe2\x80\x9cportable property.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI should not have told her No, if I had been you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Jaggers;\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cbut every man ought to know his own business best.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEvery man\xe2\x80\x99s business,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wemmick, rather reproachfully towards me,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cis portable property.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs I thought the time was now come for pursuing the theme I had at\r\nheart, I said, turning on Mr. Jaggers:--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did ask something of Miss Havisham, however, sir. I asked her to give\r\nme some information relative to her adopted daughter, and she gave me\r\nall she possessed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid she?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Jaggers, bending forward to look at his boots and\r\nthen straightening himself. \xe2\x80\x9cHah! I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I should have done so,\r\nif I had been Miss Havisham. But she ought to know her own business\r\nbest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know more of the history of Miss Havisham\xe2\x80\x99s adopted child than Miss\r\nHavisham herself does, sir. I know her mother.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Jaggers looked at me inquiringly, and repeated \xe2\x80\x9cMother?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have seen her mother within these three days.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Jaggers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd so have you, sir. And you have seen her still more recently.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Jaggers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps I know more of Estella\xe2\x80\x99s history than even you do,\xe2\x80\x9d said I. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\nknow her father too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA certain stop that Mr. Jaggers came to in his manner--he was too\r\nself-possessed to change his manner, but he could not help its being\r\nbrought to an indefinably attentive stop--assured me that he did not\r\nknow who her father was. This I had strongly suspected from Provis\xe2\x80\x99s\r\naccount (as Herbert had repeated it) of his having kept himself dark;\r\nwhich I pieced on to the fact that he himself was not Mr. Jaggers\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nclient until some four years later, and when he could have no reason for\r\nclaiming his identity. But, I could not be sure of this unconsciousness\r\non Mr. Jaggers\xe2\x80\x99s part before, though I was quite sure of it now.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo! You know the young lady\xe2\x80\x99s father, Pip?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Jaggers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d I replied, \xe2\x80\x9cand his name is Provis--from New South Wales.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEven Mr. Jaggers started when I said those words. It was the slightest\r\nstart that could escape a man, the most carefully repressed and the\r\nsooner checked, but he did start, though he made it a part of the\r\naction of taking out his pocket-handkerchief. How Wemmick received the\r\nannouncement I am unable to say; for I was afraid to look at him just\r\nthen, lest Mr. Jaggers\xe2\x80\x99s sharpness should detect that there had been\r\nsome communication unknown to him between us.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd on what evidence, Pip,\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mr. Jaggers, very coolly, as he\r\npaused with his handkerchief half way to his nose, \xe2\x80\x9cdoes Provis make\r\nthis claim?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe does not make it,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cand has never made it, and has no\r\nknowledge or belief that his daughter is in existence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor once, the powerful pocket-handkerchief failed. My reply was so\r\nunexpected, that Mr. Jaggers put the handkerchief back into his pocket\r\nwithout completing the usual performance, folded his arms, and looked\r\nwith stern attention at me, though with an immovable face.\r\n\r\nThen I told him all I knew, and how I knew it; with the one reservation\r\nthat I left him to infer that I knew from Miss Havisham what I in fact\r\nknew from Wemmick. I was very careful indeed as to that. Nor did I look\r\ntowards Wemmick until I had finished all I had to tell, and had been for\r\nsome time silently meeting Mr. Jaggers\xe2\x80\x99s look. When I did at last turn\r\nmy eyes in Wemmick\xe2\x80\x99s direction, I found that he had unposted his pen,\r\nand was intent upon the table before him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHah!\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Jaggers at last, as he moved towards the papers on the\r\ntable. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat item was it you were at, Wemmick, when Mr. Pip came in?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBut I could not submit to be thrown off in that way, and I made a\r\npassionate, almost an indignant appeal, to him to be more frank and\r\nmanly with me. I reminded him of the false hopes into which I had\r\nlapsed, the length of time they had lasted, and the discovery I had\r\nmade: and I hinted at the danger that weighed upon my spirits. I\r\nrepresented myself as being surely worthy of some little confidence from\r\nhim, in return for the confidence I had just now imparted. I said that\r\nI did not blame him, or suspect him, or mistrust him, but I wanted\r\nassurance of the truth from him. And if he asked me why I wanted it,\r\nand why I thought I had any right to it, I would tell him, little as he\r\ncared for such poor dreams, that I had loved Estella dearly and long,\r\nand that although I had lost her, and must live a bereaved life,\r\nwhatever concerned her was still nearer and dearer to me than anything\r\nelse in the world. And seeing that Mr. Jaggers stood quite still and\r\nsilent, and apparently quite obdurate, under this appeal, I turned to\r\nWemmick, and said, \xe2\x80\x9cWemmick, I know you to be a man with a gentle\r\nheart. I have seen your pleasant home, and your old father, and all the\r\ninnocent, cheerful playful ways with which you refresh your business\r\nlife. And I entreat you to say a word for me to Mr. Jaggers, and to\r\nrepresent to him that, all circumstances considered, he ought to be more\r\nopen with me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI have never seen two men look more oddly at one another than Mr.\r\nJaggers and Wemmick did after this apostrophe. At first, a misgiving\r\ncrossed me that Wemmick would be instantly dismissed from his\r\nemployment; but it melted as I saw Mr. Jaggers relax into something like\r\na smile, and Wemmick become bolder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s all this?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Jaggers. \xe2\x80\x9cYou with an old father, and you\r\nwith pleasant and playful ways?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell!\xe2\x80\x9d returned Wemmick. \xe2\x80\x9cIf I don\xe2\x80\x99t bring \xe2\x80\x98em here, what does it\r\nmatter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPip,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Jaggers, laying his hand upon my arm, and smiling\r\nopenly, \xe2\x80\x9cthis man must be the most cunning impostor in all London.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot a bit of it,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Wemmick, growing bolder and bolder. \xe2\x80\x9cI think\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99re another.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAgain they exchanged their former odd looks, each apparently still\r\ndistrustful that the other was taking him in.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou with a pleasant home?\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Jaggers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSince it don\xe2\x80\x99t interfere with business,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Wemmick, \xe2\x80\x9clet it be\r\nso. Now, I look at you, sir, I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t wonder if you might be planning\r\nand contriving to have a pleasant home of your own one of these days,\r\nwhen you\xe2\x80\x99re tired of all this work.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMr. Jaggers nodded his head retrospectively two or three times, and\r\nactually drew a sigh. \xe2\x80\x9cPip,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cwe won\xe2\x80\x99t talk about \xe2\x80\x98poor\r\ndreams;\xe2\x80\x99 you know more about such things than I, having much fresher\r\nexperience of that kind. But now about this other matter. I\xe2\x80\x99ll put a\r\ncase to you. Mind! I admit nothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe waited for me to declare that I quite understood that he expressly\r\nsaid that he admitted nothing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, Pip,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Jaggers, \xe2\x80\x9cput this case. Put the case that a\r\nwoman, under such circumstances as you have mentioned, held her child\r\nconcealed, and was obliged to communicate the fact to her legal adviser,\r\non his representing to her that he must know, with an eye to the\r\nlatitude of his defence, how the fact stood about that child. Put the\r\ncase that, at the same time he held a trust to find a child for an\r\neccentric rich lady to adopt and bring up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI follow you, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPut the case that he lived in an atmosphere of evil, and that all he\r\nsaw of children was their being generated in great numbers for certain\r\ndestruction. Put the case that he often saw children solemnly tried at\r\na criminal bar, where they were held up to be seen; put the case that\r\nhe habitually knew of their being imprisoned, whipped, transported,\r\nneglected, cast out, qualified in all ways for the hangman, and growing\r\nup to be hanged. Put the case that pretty nigh all the children he saw\r\nin his daily business life he had reason to look upon as so much\r\nspawn, to develop into the fish that were to come to his net,--to be\r\nprosecuted, defended, forsworn, made orphans, bedevilled somehow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI follow you, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPut the case, Pip, that here was one pretty little child out of the\r\nheap who could be saved; whom the father believed dead, and dared make\r\nno stir about; as to whom, over the mother, the legal adviser had this\r\npower: \xe2\x80\x9cI know what you did, and how you did it. You came so and so, you\r\ndid such and such things to divert suspicion. I have tracked you through\r\nit all, and I tell it you all. Part with the child, unless it should\r\nbe necessary to produce it to clear you, and then it shall be produced.\r\nGive the child into my hands, and I will do my best to bring you off. If\r\nyou are saved, your child is saved too; if you are lost, your child is\r\nstill saved.\xe2\x80\x9d Put the case that this was done, and that the woman was\r\ncleared.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI understand you perfectly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut that I make no admissions?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat you make no admissions.\xe2\x80\x9d And Wemmick repeated, \xe2\x80\x9cNo admissions.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPut the case, Pip, that passion and the terror of death had a little\r\nshaken the woman\xe2\x80\x99s intellects, and that when she was set at liberty,\r\nshe was scared out of the ways of the world, and went to him to be\r\nsheltered. Put the case that he took her in, and that he kept down the\r\nold, wild, violent nature whenever he saw an inkling of its breaking\r\nout, by asserting his power over her in the old way. Do you comprehend\r\nthe imaginary case?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPut the case that the child grew up, and was married for money. That\r\nthe mother was still living. That the father was still living. That the\r\nmother and father, unknown to one another, were dwelling within so many\r\nmiles, furlongs, yards if you like, of one another. That the secret was\r\nstill a secret, except that you had got wind of it. Put that last case\r\nto yourself very carefully.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI ask Wemmick to put it to himself very carefully.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd Wemmick said, \xe2\x80\x9cI do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor whose sake would you reveal the secret? For the father\xe2\x80\x99s? I think\r\nhe would not be much the better for the mother. For the mother\xe2\x80\x99s? I\r\nthink if she had done such a deed she would be safer where she was.\r\nFor the daughter\xe2\x80\x99s? I think it would hardly serve her to establish her\r\nparentage for the information of her husband, and to drag her back to\r\ndisgrace, after an escape of twenty years, pretty secure to last for\r\nlife. But add the case that you had loved her, Pip, and had made her the\r\nsubject of those \xe2\x80\x98poor dreams\xe2\x80\x99 which have, at one time or another, been\r\nin the heads of more men than you think likely, then I tell you that you\r\nhad better--and would much sooner when you had thought well of it--chop\r\noff that bandaged left hand of yours with your bandaged right hand, and\r\nthen pass the chopper on to Wemmick there, to cut that off too.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI looked at Wemmick, whose face was very grave. He gravely touched his\r\nlips with his forefinger. I did the same. Mr. Jaggers did the same.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, Wemmick,\xe2\x80\x9d said the latter then, resuming his usual manner, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat\r\nitem was it you were at when Mr. Pip came in?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nStanding by for a little, while they were at work, I observed that the\r\nodd looks they had cast at one another were repeated several times: with\r\nthis difference now, that each of them seemed suspicious, not to say\r\nconscious, of having shown himself in a weak and unprofessional light to\r\nthe other. For this reason, I suppose, they were now inflexible with one\r\nanother; Mr. Jaggers being highly dictatorial, and Wemmick obstinately\r\njustifying himself whenever there was the smallest point in abeyance for\r\na moment. I had never seen them on such ill terms; for generally they\r\ngot on very well indeed together.\r\n\r\nBut they were both happily relieved by the opportune appearance of Mike,\r\nthe client with the fur cap and the habit of wiping his nose on his\r\nsleeve, whom I had seen on the very first day of my appearance within\r\nthose walls. This individual, who, either in his own person or in that\r\nof some member of his family, seemed to be always in trouble (which in\r\nthat place meant Newgate), called to announce that his eldest daughter\r\nwas taken up on suspicion of shoplifting. As he imparted this melancholy\r\ncircumstance to Wemmick, Mr. Jaggers standing magisterially before the\r\nfire and taking no share in the proceedings, Mike\xe2\x80\x99s eye happened to\r\ntwinkle with a tear.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you about?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded Wemmick, with the utmost indignation.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you come snivelling here for?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t go to do it, Mr. Wemmick.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou did,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wemmick. \xe2\x80\x9cHow dare you? You\xe2\x80\x99re not in a fit state to\r\ncome here, if you can\xe2\x80\x99t come here without spluttering like a bad pen.\r\nWhat do you mean by it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA man can\xe2\x80\x99t help his feelings, Mr. Wemmick,\xe2\x80\x9d pleaded Mike.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHis what?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded Wemmick, quite savagely. \xe2\x80\x9cSay that again!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow look here my man,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Jaggers, advancing a step, and pointing\r\nto the door. \xe2\x80\x9cGet out of this office. I\xe2\x80\x99ll have no feelings here. Get\r\nout.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt serves you right,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wemmick, \xe2\x80\x9cGet out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSo, the unfortunate Mike very humbly withdrew, and Mr. Jaggers and\r\nWemmick appeared to have re-established their good understanding, and\r\nwent to work again with an air of refreshment upon them as if they had\r\njust had lunch.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter LII\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom Little Britain I went, with my check in my pocket, to Miss\r\nSkiffins\xe2\x80\x99s brother, the accountant; and Miss Skiffins\xe2\x80\x99s brother, the\r\naccountant, going straight to Clarriker\xe2\x80\x99s and bringing Clarriker to me,\r\nI had the great satisfaction of concluding that arrangement. It was the\r\nonly good thing I had done, and the only completed thing I had done,\r\nsince I was first apprised of my great expectations.\r\n\r\nClarriker informing me on that occasion that the affairs of the House\r\nwere steadily progressing, that he would now be able to establish a\r\nsmall branch-house in the East which was much wanted for the extension\r\nof the business, and that Herbert in his new partnership capacity would\r\ngo out and take charge of it, I found that I must have prepared for\r\na separation from my friend, even though my own affairs had been more\r\nsettled. And now, indeed, I felt as if my last anchor were loosening its\r\nhold, and I should soon be driving with the winds and waves.\r\n\r\nBut there was recompense in the joy with which Herbert would come home\r\nof a night and tell me of these changes, little imagining that he told\r\nme no news, and would sketch airy pictures of himself conducting Clara\r\nBarley to the land of the Arabian Nights, and of me going out to join\r\nthem (with a caravan of camels, I believe), and of our all going up the\r\nNile and seeing wonders. Without being sanguine as to my own part in\r\nthose bright plans, I felt that Herbert\xe2\x80\x99s way was clearing fast, and\r\nthat old Bill Barley had but to stick to his pepper and rum, and his\r\ndaughter would soon be happily provided for.\r\n\r\nWe had now got into the month of March. My left arm, though it presented\r\nno bad symptoms, took, in the natural course, so long to heal that I\r\nwas still unable to get a coat on. My right arm was tolerably restored;\r\ndisfigured, but fairly serviceable.\r\n\r\nOn a Monday morning, when Herbert and I were at breakfast, I received\r\nthe following letter from Wemmick by the post.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWalworth. Burn this as soon as read. Early in the week, or say\r\nWednesday, you might do what you know of, if you felt disposed to try\r\nit. Now burn.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen I had shown this to Herbert and had put it in the fire--but not\r\nbefore we had both got it by heart--we considered what to do. For, of\r\ncourse my being disabled could now be no longer kept out of view.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have thought it over again and again,\xe2\x80\x9d said Herbert, \xe2\x80\x9cand I think I\r\nknow a better course than taking a Thames waterman. Take Startop. A good\r\nfellow, a skilled hand, fond of us, and enthusiastic and honorable.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI had thought of him more than once.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut how much would you tell him, Herbert?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is necessary to tell him very little. Let him suppose it a mere\r\nfreak, but a secret one, until the morning comes: then let him know that\r\nthere is urgent reason for your getting Provis aboard and away. You go\r\nwith him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo doubt.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt had seemed to me, in the many anxious considerations I had given the\r\npoint, almost indifferent what port we made for,--Hamburg, Rotterdam,\r\nAntwerp,--the place signified little, so that he was out of England. Any\r\nforeign steamer that fell in our way and would take us up would do.\r\nI had always proposed to myself to get him well down the river in the\r\nboat; certainly well beyond Gravesend, which was a critical place for\r\nsearch or inquiry if suspicion were afoot. As foreign steamers would\r\nleave London at about the time of high-water, our plan would be to get\r\ndown the river by a previous ebb-tide, and lie by in some quiet spot\r\nuntil we could pull off to one. The time when one would be due where we\r\nlay, wherever that might be, could be calculated pretty nearly, if we\r\nmade inquiries beforehand.\r\n\r\nHerbert assented to all this, and we went out immediately after\r\nbreakfast to pursue our investigations. We found that a steamer for\r\nHamburg was likely to suit our purpose best, and we directed our\r\nthoughts chiefly to that vessel. But we noted down what other foreign\r\nsteamers would leave London with the same tide, and we satisfied\r\nourselves that we knew the build and color of each. We then separated\r\nfor a few hours: I, to get at once such passports as were necessary;\r\nHerbert, to see Startop at his lodgings. We both did what we had to do\r\nwithout any hindrance, and when we met again at one o\xe2\x80\x99clock reported\r\nit done. I, for my part, was prepared with passports; Herbert had seen\r\nStartop, and he was more than ready to join.\r\n\r\nThose two should pull a pair of oars, we settled, and I would steer; our\r\ncharge would be sitter, and keep quiet; as speed was not our object, we\r\nshould make way enough. We arranged that Herbert should not come home to\r\ndinner before going to Mill Pond Bank that evening; that he should\r\nnot go there at all to-morrow evening, Tuesday; that he should prepare\r\nProvis to come down to some stairs hard by the house, on Wednesday, when\r\nhe saw us approach, and not sooner; that all the arrangements with\r\nhim should be concluded that Monday night; and that he should be\r\ncommunicated with no more in any way, until we took him on board.\r\n\r\nThese precautions well understood by both of us, I went home.\r\n\r\nOn opening the outer door of our chambers with my key, I found a letter\r\nin the box, directed to me; a very dirty letter, though not ill-written.\r\nIt had been delivered by hand (of course, since I left home), and its\r\ncontents were these:--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you are not afraid to come to the old marshes to-night or to-morrow\r\nnight at nine, and to come to the little sluice-house by the limekiln,\r\nyou had better come. If you want information regarding your uncle\r\nProvis, you had much better come and tell no one, and lose no time. You\r\nmust come alone. Bring this with you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI had had load enough upon my mind before the receipt of this strange\r\nletter. What to do now, I could not tell. And the worst was, that I must\r\ndecide quickly, or I should miss the afternoon coach, which would take\r\nme down in time for to-night. To-morrow night I could not think of\r\ngoing, for it would be too close upon the time of the flight. And again,\r\nfor anything I knew, the proffered information might have some important\r\nbearing on the flight itself.\r\n\r\nIf I had had ample time for consideration, I believe I should still have\r\ngone. Having hardly any time for consideration,--my watch showing me\r\nthat the coach started within half an hour,--I resolved to go. I should\r\ncertainly not have gone, but for the reference to my Uncle Provis. That,\r\ncoming on Wemmick\xe2\x80\x99s letter and the morning\xe2\x80\x99s busy preparation, turned\r\nthe scale.\r\n\r\nIt is so difficult to become clearly possessed of the contents of almost\r\nany letter, in a violent hurry, that I had to read this mysterious\r\nepistle again twice, before its injunction to me to be secret got\r\nmechanically into my mind. Yielding to it in the same mechanical kind of\r\nway, I left a note in pencil for Herbert, telling him that as I should\r\nbe so soon going away, I knew not for how long, I had decided to hurry\r\ndown and back, to ascertain for myself how Miss Havisham was faring.\r\nI had then barely time to get my great-coat, lock up the chambers,\r\nand make for the coach-office by the short by-ways. If I had taken a\r\nhackney-chariot and gone by the streets, I should have missed my aim;\r\ngoing as I did, I caught the coach just as it came out of the yard. I\r\nwas the only inside passenger, jolting away knee-deep in straw, when I\r\ncame to myself.\r\n\r\nFor I really had not been myself since the receipt of the letter; it had\r\nso bewildered me, ensuing on the hurry of the morning. The morning hurry\r\nand flutter had been great; for, long and anxiously as I had waited for\r\nWemmick, his hint had come like a surprise at last. And now I began\r\nto wonder at myself for being in the coach, and to doubt whether I had\r\nsufficient reason for being there, and to consider whether I should\r\nget out presently and go back, and to argue against ever heeding an\r\nanonymous communication, and, in short, to pass through all those phases\r\nof contradiction and indecision to which I suppose very few hurried\r\npeople are strangers. Still, the reference to Provis by name mastered\r\neverything. I reasoned as I had reasoned already without knowing it,--if\r\nthat be reasoning,--in case any harm should befall him through my not\r\ngoing, how could I ever forgive myself!\r\n\r\nIt was dark before we got down, and the journey seemed long and dreary\r\nto me, who could see little of it inside, and who could not go outside\r\nin my disabled state. Avoiding the Blue Boar, I put up at an inn of\r\nminor reputation down the town, and ordered some dinner. While it was\r\npreparing, I went to Satis House and inquired for Miss Havisham; she was\r\nstill very ill, though considered something better.\r\n\r\nMy inn had once been a part of an ancient ecclesiastical house, and I\r\ndined in a little octagonal common-room, like a font. As I was not able\r\nto cut my dinner, the old landlord with a shining bald head did it for\r\nme. This bringing us into conversation, he was so good as to entertain\r\nme with my own story,--of course with the popular feature that\r\nPumblechook was my earliest benefactor and the founder of my fortunes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know the young man?\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKnow him!\xe2\x80\x9d repeated the landlord. \xe2\x80\x9cEver since he was--no height at\r\nall.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoes he ever come back to this neighborhood?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, he comes back,\xe2\x80\x9d said the landlord, \xe2\x80\x9cto his great friends, now and\r\nagain, and gives the cold shoulder to the man that made him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat man is that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHim that I speak of,\xe2\x80\x9d said the landlord. \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Pumblechook.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs he ungrateful to no one else?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo doubt he would be, if he could,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the landlord, \xe2\x80\x9cbut he\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t. And why? Because Pumblechook done everything for him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDoes Pumblechook say so?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSay so!\xe2\x80\x9d replied the landlord. \xe2\x80\x9cHe han\xe2\x80\x99t no call to say so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut does he say so?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt would turn a man\xe2\x80\x99s blood to white wine winegar to hear him tell of\r\nit, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said the landlord.\r\n\r\nI thought, \xe2\x80\x9cYet Joe, dear Joe, you never tell of it. Long-suffering and\r\nloving Joe, you never complain. Nor you, sweet-tempered Biddy!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYour appetite\xe2\x80\x99s been touched like by your accident,\xe2\x80\x9d said the landlord,\r\nglancing at the bandaged arm under my coat. \xe2\x80\x9cTry a tenderer bit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, thank you,\xe2\x80\x9d I replied, turning from the table to brood over the\r\nfire. \xe2\x80\x9cI can eat no more. Please take it away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI had never been struck at so keenly, for my thanklessness to Joe, as\r\nthrough the brazen impostor Pumblechook. The falser he, the truer Joe;\r\nthe meaner he, the nobler Joe.\r\n\r\nMy heart was deeply and most deservedly humbled as I mused over the fire\r\nfor an hour or more. The striking of the clock aroused me, but not from\r\nmy dejection or remorse, and I got up and had my coat fastened round\r\nmy neck, and went out. I had previously sought in my pockets for the\r\nletter, that I might refer to it again; but I could not find it, and\r\nwas uneasy to think that it must have been dropped in the straw of\r\nthe coach. I knew very well, however, that the appointed place was the\r\nlittle sluice-house by the limekiln on the marshes, and the hour nine.\r\nTowards the marshes I now went straight, having no time to spare.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter LIII\r\n\r\nIt was a dark night, though the full moon rose as I left the enclosed\r\nlands, and passed out upon the marshes. Beyond their dark line there was\r\na ribbon of clear sky, hardly broad enough to hold the red large moon.\r\nIn a few minutes she had ascended out of that clear field, in among the\r\npiled mountains of cloud.\r\n\r\nThere was a melancholy wind, and the marshes were very dismal. A\r\nstranger would have found them insupportable, and even to me they were\r\nso oppressive that I hesitated, half inclined to go back. But I knew\r\nthem well, and could have found my way on a far darker night, and had\r\nno excuse for returning, being there. So, having come there against my\r\ninclination, I went on against it.\r\n\r\nThe direction that I took was not that in which my old home lay, nor\r\nthat in which we had pursued the convicts. My back was turned towards\r\nthe distant Hulks as I walked on, and, though I could see the old lights\r\naway on the spits of sand, I saw them over my shoulder. I knew the\r\nlimekiln as well as I knew the old Battery, but they were miles apart;\r\nso that, if a light had been burning at each point that night, there\r\nwould have been a long strip of the blank horizon between the two bright\r\nspecks.\r\n\r\nAt first, I had to shut some gates after me, and now and then to stand\r\nstill while the cattle that were lying in the banked-up pathway arose\r\nand blundered down among the grass and reeds. But after a little while I\r\nseemed to have the whole flats to myself.\r\n\r\nIt was another half-hour before I drew near to the kiln. The lime was\r\nburning with a sluggish stifling smell, but the fires were made up and\r\nleft, and no workmen were visible. Hard by was a small stone-quarry. It\r\nlay directly in my way, and had been worked that day, as I saw by the\r\ntools and barrows that were lying about.\r\n\r\nComing up again to the marsh level out of this excavation,--for the rude\r\npath lay through it,--I saw a light in the old sluice-house. I quickened\r\nmy pace, and knocked at the door with my hand. Waiting for some reply,\r\nI looked about me, noticing how the sluice was abandoned and broken, and\r\nhow the house--of wood with a tiled roof--would not be proof against the\r\nweather much longer, if it were so even now, and how the mud and ooze\r\nwere coated with lime, and how the choking vapor of the kiln crept in a\r\nghostly way towards me. Still there was no answer, and I knocked again.\r\nNo answer still, and I tried the latch.\r\n\r\nIt rose under my hand, and the door yielded. Looking in, I saw a lighted\r\ncandle on a table, a bench, and a mattress on a truckle bedstead. As\r\nthere was a loft above, I called, \xe2\x80\x9cIs there any one here?\xe2\x80\x9d but no voice\r\nanswered. Then I looked at my watch, and, finding that it was past nine,\r\ncalled again, \xe2\x80\x9cIs there any one here?\xe2\x80\x9d There being still no answer, I\r\nwent out at the door, irresolute what to do.\r\n\r\nIt was beginning to rain fast. Seeing nothing save what I had seen\r\nalready, I turned back into the house, and stood just within the shelter\r\nof the doorway, looking out into the night. While I was considering that\r\nsome one must have been there lately and must soon be coming back, or\r\nthe candle would not be burning, it came into my head to look if the\r\nwick were long. I turned round to do so, and had taken up the candle in\r\nmy hand, when it was extinguished by some violent shock; and the next\r\nthing I comprehended was, that I had been caught in a strong running\r\nnoose, thrown over my head from behind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow,\xe2\x80\x9d said a suppressed voice with an oath, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve got you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is this?\xe2\x80\x9d I cried, struggling. \xe2\x80\x9cWho is it? Help, help, help!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNot only were my arms pulled close to my sides, but the pressure on\r\nmy bad arm caused me exquisite pain. Sometimes, a strong man\xe2\x80\x99s hand,\r\nsometimes a strong man\xe2\x80\x99s breast, was set against my mouth to deaden\r\nmy cries, and with a hot breath always close to me, I struggled\r\nineffectually in the dark, while I was fastened tight to the wall. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd\r\nnow,\xe2\x80\x9d said the suppressed voice with another oath, \xe2\x80\x9ccall out again, and\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll make short work of you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFaint and sick with the pain of my injured arm, bewildered by the\r\nsurprise, and yet conscious how easily this threat could be put in\r\nexecution, I desisted, and tried to ease my arm were it ever so little.\r\nBut, it was bound too tight for that. I felt as if, having been burnt\r\nbefore, it were now being boiled.\r\n\r\nThe sudden exclusion of the night, and the substitution of black\r\ndarkness in its place, warned me that the man had closed a shutter.\r\nAfter groping about for a little, he found the flint and steel he\r\nwanted, and began to strike a light. I strained my sight upon the sparks\r\nthat fell among the tinder, and upon which he breathed and breathed,\r\nmatch in hand, but I could only see his lips, and the blue point of\r\nthe match; even those but fitfully. The tinder was damp,--no wonder\r\nthere,--and one after another the sparks died out.\r\n\r\nThe man was in no hurry, and struck again with the flint and steel. As\r\nthe sparks fell thick and bright about him, I could see his hands, and\r\ntouches of his face, and could make out that he was seated and bending\r\nover the table; but nothing more. Presently I saw his blue lips again,\r\nbreathing on the tinder, and then a flare of light flashed up, and\r\nshowed me Orlick.\r\n\r\nWhom I had looked for, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. I had not looked for him. Seeing\r\nhim, I felt that I was in a dangerous strait indeed, and I kept my eyes\r\nupon him.\r\n\r\nHe lighted the candle from the flaring match with great deliberation,\r\nand dropped the match, and trod it out. Then he put the candle away from\r\nhim on the table, so that he could see me, and sat with his arms folded\r\non the table and looked at me. I made out that I was fastened to a stout\r\nperpendicular ladder a few inches from the wall,--a fixture there,--the\r\nmeans of ascent to the loft above.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, when we had surveyed one another for some time, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\ngot you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cUnbind me. Let me go!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d he returned, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll let you go. I\xe2\x80\x99ll let you go to the moon, I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nlet you go to the stars. All in good time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy have you lured me here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you know?\xe2\x80\x9d said he, with a deadly look.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy have you set upon me in the dark?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBecause I mean to do it all myself. One keeps a secret better than two.\r\nO you enemy, you enemy!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis enjoyment of the spectacle I furnished, as he sat with his arms\r\nfolded on the table, shaking his head at me and hugging himself, had a\r\nmalignity in it that made me tremble. As I watched him in silence,\r\nhe put his hand into the corner at his side, and took up a gun with a\r\nbrass-bound stock.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know this?\xe2\x80\x9d said he, making as if he would take aim at me. \xe2\x80\x9cDo\r\nyou know where you saw it afore? Speak, wolf!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d I answered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou cost me that place. You did. Speak!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat else could I do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou did that, and that would be enough, without more. How dared you to\r\ncome betwixt me and a young woman I liked?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen did I?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen didn\xe2\x80\x99t you? It was you as always give Old Orlick a bad name to\r\nher.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou gave it to yourself; you gained it for yourself. I could have done\r\nyou no harm, if you had done yourself none.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re a liar. And you\xe2\x80\x99ll take any pains, and spend any money, to drive\r\nme out of this country, will you?\xe2\x80\x9d said he, repeating my words to Biddy\r\nin the last interview I had with her. \xe2\x80\x9cNow, I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you a piece of\r\ninformation. It was never so well worth your while to get me out of this\r\ncountry as it is to-night. Ah! If it was all your money twenty times\r\ntold, to the last brass farden!\xe2\x80\x9d As he shook his heavy hand at me, with\r\nhis mouth snarling like a tiger\xe2\x80\x99s, I felt that it was true.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you going to do to me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m a going,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, bringing his fist down upon the table with a\r\nheavy blow, and rising as the blow fell to give it greater force,--\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m\r\na going to have your life!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe leaned forward staring at me, slowly unclenched his hand and drew it\r\nacross his mouth as if his mouth watered for me, and sat down again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou was always in Old Orlick\xe2\x80\x99s way since ever you was a child. You goes\r\nout of his way this present night. He\xe2\x80\x99ll have no more on you. You\xe2\x80\x99re\r\ndead.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI felt that I had come to the brink of my grave. For a moment I looked\r\nwildly round my trap for any chance of escape; but there was none.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMore than that,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, folding his arms on the table again, \xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nhave a rag of you, I won\xe2\x80\x99t have a bone of you, left on earth. I\xe2\x80\x99ll put\r\nyour body in the kiln,--I\xe2\x80\x99d carry two such to it, on my Shoulders,--and,\r\nlet people suppose what they may of you, they shall never know nothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMy mind, with inconceivable rapidity followed out all the consequences\r\nof such a death. Estella\xe2\x80\x99s father would believe I had deserted him,\r\nwould be taken, would die accusing me; even Herbert would doubt me,\r\nwhen he compared the letter I had left for him with the fact that I had\r\ncalled at Miss Havisham\xe2\x80\x99s gate for only a moment; Joe and Biddy would\r\nnever know how sorry I had been that night, none would ever know what\r\nI had suffered, how true I had meant to be, what an agony I had passed\r\nthrough. The death close before me was terrible, but far more terrible\r\nthan death was the dread of being misremembered after death. And\r\nso quick were my thoughts, that I saw myself despised by unborn\r\ngenerations,--Estella\xe2\x80\x99s children, and their children,--while the\r\nwretch\xe2\x80\x99s words were yet on his lips.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow, wolf,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cafore I kill you like any other beast,--which is\r\nwot I mean to do and wot I have tied you up for,--I\xe2\x80\x99ll have a good look\r\nat you and a good goad at you. O you enemy!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt had passed through my thoughts to cry out for help again; though\r\nfew could know better than I, the solitary nature of the spot, and the\r\nhopelessness of aid. But as he sat gloating over me, I was supported by\r\na scornful detestation of him that sealed my lips. Above all things, I\r\nresolved that I would not entreat him, and that I would die making some\r\nlast poor resistance to him. Softened as my thoughts of all the rest of\r\nmen were in that dire extremity; humbly beseeching pardon, as I did, of\r\nHeaven; melted at heart, as I was, by the thought that I had taken no\r\nfarewell, and never now could take farewell of those who were dear to\r\nme, or could explain myself to them, or ask for their compassion on my\r\nmiserable errors,--still, if I could have killed him, even in dying, I\r\nwould have done it.\r\n\r\nHe had been drinking, and his eyes were red and bloodshot. Around his\r\nneck was slung a tin bottle, as I had often seen his meat and drink\r\nslung about him in other days. He brought the bottle to his lips, and\r\ntook a fiery drink from it; and I smelt the strong spirits that I saw\r\nflash into his face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWolf!\xe2\x80\x9d said he, folding his arms again, \xe2\x80\x9cOld Orlick\xe2\x80\x99s a going to tell\r\nyou somethink. It was you as did for your shrew sister.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAgain my mind, with its former inconceivable rapidity, had exhausted the\r\nwhole subject of the attack upon my sister, her illness, and her death,\r\nbefore his slow and hesitating speech had formed these words.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was you, villain,\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI tell you it was your doing,--I tell you it was done through you,\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\nretorted, catching up the gun, and making a blow with the stock at the\r\nvacant air between us. \xe2\x80\x9cI come upon her from behind, as I come upon you\r\nto-night. I giv\xe2\x80\x99 it her! I left her for dead, and if there had been a\r\nlimekiln as nigh her as there is now nigh you, she shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have come\r\nto life again. But it warn\xe2\x80\x99t Old Orlick as did it; it was you. You was\r\nfavored, and he was bullied and beat. Old Orlick bullied and beat, eh?\r\nNow you pays for it. You done it; now you pays for it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe drank again, and became more ferocious. I saw by his tilting of\r\nthe bottle that there was no great quantity left in it. I distinctly\r\nunderstood that he was working himself up with its contents to make an\r\nend of me. I knew that every drop it held was a drop of my life. I knew\r\nthat when I was changed into a part of the vapor that had crept towards\r\nme but a little while before, like my own warning ghost, he would do\r\nas he had done in my sister\xe2\x80\x99s case,--make all haste to the town, and\r\nbe seen slouching about there drinking at the alehouses. My rapid mind\r\npursued him to the town, made a picture of the street with him in it,\r\nand contrasted its lights and life with the lonely marsh and the white\r\nvapor creeping over it, into which I should have dissolved.\r\n\r\nIt was not only that I could have summed up years and years and years\r\nwhile he said a dozen words, but that what he did say presented pictures\r\nto me, and not mere words. In the excited and exalted state of my brain,\r\nI could not think of a place without seeing it, or of persons without\r\nseeing them. It is impossible to overstate the vividness of these\r\nimages, and yet I was so intent, all the time, upon him himself,--who\r\nwould not be intent on the tiger crouching to spring!--that I knew of\r\nthe slightest action of his fingers.\r\n\r\nWhen he had drunk this second time, he rose from the bench on which\r\nhe sat, and pushed the table aside. Then, he took up the candle, and,\r\nshading it with his murderous hand so as to throw its light on me, stood\r\nbefore me, looking at me and enjoying the sight.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWolf, I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you something more. It was Old Orlick as you tumbled\r\nover on your stairs that night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI saw the staircase with its extinguished lamps. I saw the shadows of\r\nthe heavy stair-rails, thrown by the watchman\xe2\x80\x99s lantern on the wall.\r\nI saw the rooms that I was never to see again; here, a door half open;\r\nthere, a door closed; all the articles of furniture around.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd why was Old Orlick there? I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you something more, wolf.\r\nYou and her have pretty well hunted me out of this country, so far as\r\ngetting a easy living in it goes, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve took up with new companions,\r\nand new masters. Some of \xe2\x80\x98em writes my letters when I wants \xe2\x80\x98em\r\nwrote,--do you mind?--writes my letters, wolf! They writes fifty hands;\r\nthey\xe2\x80\x99re not like sneaking you, as writes but one. I\xe2\x80\x99ve had a firm mind\r\nand a firm will to have your life, since you was down here at your\r\nsister\xe2\x80\x99s burying. I han\xe2\x80\x99t seen a way to get you safe, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve looked\r\narter you to know your ins and outs. For, says Old Orlick to himself,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Somehow or another I\xe2\x80\x99ll have him!\xe2\x80\x99 What! When I looks for you, I finds\r\nyour uncle Provis, eh?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMill Pond Bank, and Chinks\xe2\x80\x99s Basin, and the Old Green Copper Rope-walk,\r\nall so clear and plain! Provis in his rooms, the signal whose use was\r\nover, pretty Clara, the good motherly woman, old Bill Barley on his\r\nback, all drifting by, as on the swift stream of my life fast running\r\nout to sea!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou with a uncle too! Why, I know\xe2\x80\x99d you at Gargery\xe2\x80\x99s when you was so\r\nsmall a wolf that I could have took your weazen betwixt this finger and\r\nthumb and chucked you away dead (as I\xe2\x80\x99d thoughts o\xe2\x80\x99 doing, odd times,\r\nwhen I see you loitering amongst the pollards on a Sunday), and you\r\nhadn\xe2\x80\x99t found no uncles then. No, not you! But when Old Orlick come for\r\nto hear that your uncle Provis had most like wore the leg-iron wot Old\r\nOrlick had picked up, filed asunder, on these meshes ever so many year\r\nago, and wot he kep by him till he dropped your sister with it, like\r\na bullock, as he means to drop you--hey?--when he come for to hear\r\nthat--hey?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn his savage taunting, he flared the candle so close at me that I\r\nturned my face aside to save it from the flame.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried, laughing, after doing it again, \xe2\x80\x9cthe burnt child dreads\r\nthe fire! Old Orlick knowed you was burnt, Old Orlick knowed you was\r\nsmuggling your uncle Provis away, Old Orlick\xe2\x80\x99s a match for you and\r\nknow\xe2\x80\x99d you\xe2\x80\x99d come to-night! Now I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you something more, wolf, and\r\nthis ends it. There\xe2\x80\x99s them that\xe2\x80\x99s as good a match for your uncle Provis\r\nas Old Orlick has been for you. Let him \xe2\x80\x98ware them, when he\xe2\x80\x99s lost his\r\nnevvy! Let him \xe2\x80\x98ware them, when no man can\xe2\x80\x99t find a rag of his dear\r\nrelation\xe2\x80\x99s clothes, nor yet a bone of his body. There\xe2\x80\x99s them that can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nand that won\xe2\x80\x99t have Magwitch,--yes, I know the name!--alive in the same\r\nland with them, and that\xe2\x80\x99s had such sure information of him when he\r\nwas alive in another land, as that he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t and shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t leave it\r\nunbeknown and put them in danger. P\xe2\x80\x99raps it\xe2\x80\x99s them that writes fifty\r\nhands, and that\xe2\x80\x99s not like sneaking you as writes but one. \xe2\x80\x98Ware\r\nCompeyson, Magwitch, and the gallows!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe flared the candle at me again, smoking my face and hair, and for an\r\ninstant blinding me, and turned his powerful back as he replaced the\r\nlight on the table. I had thought a prayer, and had been with Joe and\r\nBiddy and Herbert, before he turned towards me again.\r\n\r\nThere was a clear space of a few feet between the table and the opposite\r\nwall. Within this space, he now slouched backwards and forwards. His\r\ngreat strength seemed to sit stronger upon him than ever before, as he\r\ndid this with his hands hanging loose and heavy at his sides, and with\r\nhis eyes scowling at me. I had no grain of hope left. Wild as my inward\r\nhurry was, and wonderful the force of the pictures that rushed by me\r\ninstead of thoughts, I could yet clearly understand that, unless he had\r\nresolved that I was within a few moments of surely perishing out of all\r\nhuman knowledge, he would never have told me what he had told.\r\n\r\nOf a sudden, he stopped, took the cork out of his bottle, and tossed\r\nit away. Light as it was, I heard it fall like a plummet. He swallowed\r\nslowly, tilting up the bottle by little and little, and now he looked at\r\nme no more. The last few drops of liquor he poured into the palm of his\r\nhand, and licked up. Then, with a sudden hurry of violence and swearing\r\nhorribly, he threw the bottle from him, and stooped; and I saw in his\r\nhand a stone-hammer with a long heavy handle.\r\n\r\nThe resolution I had made did not desert me, for, without uttering\r\none vain word of appeal to him, I shouted out with all my might, and\r\nstruggled with all my might. It was only my head and my legs that I\r\ncould move, but to that extent I struggled with all the force, until\r\nthen unknown, that was within me. In the same instant I heard responsive\r\nshouts, saw figures and a gleam of light dash in at the door, heard\r\nvoices and tumult, and saw Orlick emerge from a struggle of men, as if\r\nit were tumbling water, clear the table at a leap, and fly out into the\r\nnight.\r\n\r\nAfter a blank, I found that I was lying unbound, on the floor, in the\r\nsame place, with my head on some one\xe2\x80\x99s knee. My eyes were fixed on the\r\nladder against the wall, when I came to myself,--had opened on it before\r\nmy mind saw it,--and thus as I recovered consciousness, I knew that I\r\nwas in the place where I had lost it.\r\n\r\nToo indifferent at first, even to look round and ascertain who supported\r\nme, I was lying looking at the ladder, when there came between me and it\r\na face. The face of Trabb\xe2\x80\x99s boy!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think he\xe2\x80\x99s all right!\xe2\x80\x9d said Trabb\xe2\x80\x99s boy, in a sober voice; \xe2\x80\x9cbut ain\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nhe just pale though!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt these words, the face of him who supported me looked over into mine,\r\nand I saw my supporter to be--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHerbert! Great Heaven!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSoftly,\xe2\x80\x9d said Herbert. \xe2\x80\x9cGently, Handel. Don\xe2\x80\x99t be too eager.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd our old comrade, Startop!\xe2\x80\x9d I cried, as he too bent over me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRemember what he is going to assist us in,\xe2\x80\x9d said Herbert, \xe2\x80\x9cand be\r\ncalm.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe allusion made me spring up; though I dropped again from the pain\r\nin my arm. \xe2\x80\x9cThe time has not gone by, Herbert, has it? What night is\r\nto-night? How long have I been here?\xe2\x80\x9d For, I had a strange and\r\nstrong misgiving that I had been lying there a long time--a day and a\r\nnight,--two days and nights,--more.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe time has not gone by. It is still Monday night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank God!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you have all to-morrow, Tuesday, to rest in,\xe2\x80\x9d said Herbert. \xe2\x80\x9cBut\r\nyou can\xe2\x80\x99t help groaning, my dear Handel. What hurt have you got? Can you\r\nstand?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cI can walk. I have no hurt but in this throbbing\r\narm.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey laid it bare, and did what they could. It was violently swollen and\r\ninflamed, and I could scarcely endure to have it touched. But, they tore\r\nup their handkerchiefs to make fresh bandages, and carefully replaced\r\nit in the sling, until we could get to the town and obtain some cooling\r\nlotion to put upon it. In a little while we had shut the door of the\r\ndark and empty sluice-house, and were passing through the quarry on our\r\nway back. Trabb\xe2\x80\x99s boy--Trabb\xe2\x80\x99s overgrown young man now--went before us\r\nwith a lantern, which was the light I had seen come in at the door. But,\r\nthe moon was a good two hours higher than when I had last seen the sky,\r\nand the night, though rainy, was much lighter. The white vapor of the\r\nkiln was passing from us as we went by, and as I had thought a prayer\r\nbefore, I thought a thanksgiving now.\r\n\r\nEntreating Herbert to tell me how he had come to my rescue,--which at\r\nfirst he had flatly refused to do, but had insisted on my remaining\r\nquiet,--I learnt that I had in my hurry dropped the letter, open, in our\r\nchambers, where he, coming home to bring with him Startop whom he had\r\nmet in the street on his way to me, found it, very soon after I\r\nwas gone. Its tone made him uneasy, and the more so because of the\r\ninconsistency between it and the hasty letter I had left for him. His\r\nuneasiness increasing instead of subsiding, after a quarter of an\r\nhour\xe2\x80\x99s consideration, he set off for the coach-office with Startop, who\r\nvolunteered his company, to make inquiry when the next coach went\r\ndown. Finding that the afternoon coach was gone, and finding that his\r\nuneasiness grew into positive alarm, as obstacles came in his way, he\r\nresolved to follow in a post-chaise. So he and Startop arrived at the\r\nBlue Boar, fully expecting there to find me, or tidings of me; but,\r\nfinding neither, went on to Miss Havisham\xe2\x80\x99s, where they lost me.\r\nHereupon they went back to the hotel (doubtless at about the time when\r\nI was hearing the popular local version of my own story) to refresh\r\nthemselves and to get some one to guide them out upon the marshes. Among\r\nthe loungers under the Boar\xe2\x80\x99s archway happened to be Trabb\xe2\x80\x99s Boy,--true\r\nto his ancient habit of happening to be everywhere where he had no\r\nbusiness,--and Trabb\xe2\x80\x99s boy had seen me passing from Miss Havisham\xe2\x80\x99s in\r\nthe direction of my dining-place. Thus Trabb\xe2\x80\x99s boy became their guide,\r\nand with him they went out to the sluice-house, though by the town way\r\nto the marshes, which I had avoided. Now, as they went along, Herbert\r\nreflected, that I might, after all, have been brought there on some\r\ngenuine and serviceable errand tending to Provis\xe2\x80\x99s safety, and,\r\nbethinking himself that in that case interruption must be mischievous,\r\nleft his guide and Startop on the edge of the quarry, and went on by\r\nhimself, and stole round the house two or three times, endeavouring to\r\nascertain whether all was right within. As he could hear nothing but\r\nindistinct sounds of one deep rough voice (this was while my mind was so\r\nbusy), he even at last began to doubt whether I was there, when suddenly\r\nI cried out loudly, and he answered the cries, and rushed in, closely\r\nfollowed by the other two.\r\n\r\nWhen I told Herbert what had passed within the house, he was for our\r\nimmediately going before a magistrate in the town, late at night as it\r\nwas, and getting out a warrant. But, I had already considered that such\r\na course, by detaining us there, or binding us to come back, might\r\nbe fatal to Provis. There was no gainsaying this difficulty, and we\r\nrelinquished all thoughts of pursuing Orlick at that time. For the\r\npresent, under the circumstances, we deemed it prudent to make rather\r\nlight of the matter to Trabb\xe2\x80\x99s boy; who, I am convinced, would have been\r\nmuch affected by disappointment, if he had known that his intervention\r\nsaved me from the limekiln. Not that Trabb\xe2\x80\x99s boy was of a malignant\r\nnature, but that he had too much spare vivacity, and that it was in his\r\nconstitution to want variety and excitement at anybody\xe2\x80\x99s expense. When\r\nwe parted, I presented him with two guineas (which seemed to meet his\r\nviews), and told him that I was sorry ever to have had an ill opinion of\r\nhim (which made no impression on him at all).\r\n\r\nWednesday being so close upon us, we determined to go back to London\r\nthat night, three in the post-chaise; the rather, as we should then be\r\nclear away before the night\xe2\x80\x99s adventure began to be talked of. Herbert\r\ngot a large bottle of stuff for my arm; and by dint of having this stuff\r\ndropped over it all the night through, I was just able to bear its pain\r\non the journey. It was daylight when we reached the Temple, and I went\r\nat once to bed, and lay in bed all day.\r\n\r\nMy terror, as I lay there, of falling ill, and being unfitted for\r\nto-morrow, was so besetting, that I wonder it did not disable me of\r\nitself. It would have done so, pretty surely, in conjunction with the\r\nmental wear and tear I had suffered, but for the unnatural strain upon\r\nme that to-morrow was. So anxiously looked forward to, charged with such\r\nconsequences, its results so impenetrably hidden, though so near.\r\n\r\nNo precaution could have been more obvious than our refraining\r\nfrom communication with him that day; yet this again increased my\r\nrestlessness. I started at every footstep and every sound, believing\r\nthat he was discovered and taken, and this was the messenger to tell\r\nme so. I persuaded myself that I knew he was taken; that there was\r\nsomething more upon my mind than a fear or a presentiment; that the fact\r\nhad occurred, and I had a mysterious knowledge of it. As the days wore\r\non, and no ill news came, as the day closed in and darkness fell,\r\nmy overshadowing dread of being disabled by illness before to-morrow\r\nmorning altogether mastered me. My burning arm throbbed, and my burning\r\nhead throbbed, and I fancied I was beginning to wander. I counted up to\r\nhigh numbers, to make sure of myself, and repeated passages that I knew\r\nin prose and verse. It happened sometimes that in the mere escape of a\r\nfatigued mind, I dozed for some moments or forgot; then I would say to\r\nmyself with a start, \xe2\x80\x9cNow it has come, and I am turning delirious!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey kept me very quiet all day, and kept my arm constantly dressed, and\r\ngave me cooling drinks. Whenever I fell asleep, I awoke with the notion\r\nI had had in the sluice-house, that a long time had elapsed and the\r\nopportunity to save him was gone. About midnight I got out of bed\r\nand went to Herbert, with the conviction that I had been asleep for\r\nfour-and-twenty hours, and that Wednesday was past. It was the last\r\nself-exhausting effort of my fretfulness, for after that I slept\r\nsoundly.\r\n\r\nWednesday morning was dawning when I looked out of window. The winking\r\nlights upon the bridges were already pale, the coming sun was like a\r\nmarsh of fire on the horizon. The river, still dark and mysterious, was\r\nspanned by bridges that were turning coldly gray, with here and there\r\nat top a warm touch from the burning in the sky. As I looked along\r\nthe clustered roofs, with church-towers and spires shooting into the\r\nunusually clear air, the sun rose up, and a veil seemed to be drawn from\r\nthe river, and millions of sparkles burst out upon its waters. From me\r\ntoo, a veil seemed to be drawn, and I felt strong and well.\r\n\r\nHerbert lay asleep in his bed, and our old fellow-student lay asleep on\r\nthe sofa. I could not dress myself without help; but I made up the fire,\r\nwhich was still burning, and got some coffee ready for them. In good\r\ntime they too started up strong and well, and we admitted the sharp\r\nmorning air at the windows, and looked at the tide that was still\r\nflowing towards us.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen it turns at nine o\xe2\x80\x99clock,\xe2\x80\x9d said Herbert, cheerfully, \xe2\x80\x9clook out for\r\nus, and stand ready, you over there at Mill Pond Bank!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter LIV\r\n\r\nIt was one of those March days when the sun shines hot and the wind\r\nblows cold: when it is summer in the light, and winter in the shade.\r\nWe had our pea-coats with us, and I took a bag. Of all my worldly\r\npossessions I took no more than the few necessaries that filled the\r\nbag. Where I might go, what I might do, or when I might return, were\r\nquestions utterly unknown to me; nor did I vex my mind with them, for\r\nit was wholly set on Provis\xe2\x80\x99s safety. I only wondered for the passing\r\nmoment, as I stopped at the door and looked back, under what altered\r\ncircumstances I should next see those rooms, if ever.\r\n\r\nWe loitered down to the Temple stairs, and stood loitering there, as if\r\nwe were not quite decided to go upon the water at all. Of course, I had\r\ntaken care that the boat should be ready and everything in order. After\r\na little show of indecision, which there were none to see but the two\r\nor three amphibious creatures belonging to our Temple stairs, we went\r\non board and cast off; Herbert in the bow, I steering. It was then about\r\nhigh-water,--half-past eight.\r\n\r\nOur plan was this. The tide, beginning to run down at nine, and being\r\nwith us until three, we intended still to creep on after it had turned,\r\nand row against it until dark. We should then be well in those long\r\nreaches below Gravesend, between Kent and Essex, where the river is\r\nbroad and solitary, where the water-side inhabitants are very few, and\r\nwhere lone public-houses are scattered here and there, of which we could\r\nchoose one for a resting-place. There, we meant to lie by all night.\r\nThe steamer for Hamburg and the steamer for Rotterdam would start from\r\nLondon at about nine on Thursday morning. We should know at what time\r\nto expect them, according to where we were, and would hail the first;\r\nso that, if by any accident we were not taken abroad, we should have\r\nanother chance. We knew the distinguishing marks of each vessel.\r\n\r\nThe relief of being at last engaged in the execution of the purpose\r\nwas so great to me that I felt it difficult to realize the condition in\r\nwhich I had been a few hours before. The crisp air, the sunlight, the\r\nmovement on the river, and the moving river itself,--the road that ran\r\nwith us, seeming to sympathize with us, animate us, and encourage us\r\non,--freshened me with new hope. I felt mortified to be of so little use\r\nin the boat; but, there were few better oarsmen than my two friends, and\r\nthey rowed with a steady stroke that was to last all day.\r\n\r\nAt that time, the steam-traffic on the Thames was far below its present\r\nextent, and watermen\xe2\x80\x99s boats were far more numerous. Of barges, sailing\r\ncolliers, and coasting-traders, there were perhaps, as many as now;\r\nbut of steam-ships, great and small, not a tithe or a twentieth part\r\nso many. Early as it was, there were plenty of scullers going here and\r\nthere that morning, and plenty of barges dropping down with the tide;\r\nthe navigation of the river between bridges, in an open boat, was a much\r\neasier and commoner matter in those days than it is in these; and we\r\nwent ahead among many skiffs and wherries briskly.\r\n\r\nOld London Bridge was soon passed, and old Billingsgate Market with its\r\noyster-boats and Dutchmen, and the White Tower and Traitor\xe2\x80\x99s Gate, and\r\nwe were in among the tiers of shipping. Here were the Leith, Aberdeen,\r\nand Glasgow steamers, loading and unloading goods, and looking immensely\r\nhigh out of the water as we passed alongside; here, were colliers by the\r\nscore and score, with the coal-whippers plunging off stages on deck, as\r\ncounterweights to measures of coal swinging up, which were then rattled\r\nover the side into barges; here, at her moorings was to-morrow\xe2\x80\x99s steamer\r\nfor Rotterdam, of which we took good notice; and here to-morrow\xe2\x80\x99s for\r\nHamburg, under whose bowsprit we crossed. And now I, sitting in the\r\nstern, could see, with a faster beating heart, Mill Pond Bank and Mill\r\nPond stairs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs he there?\xe2\x80\x9d said Herbert.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot yet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cRight! He was not to come down till he saw us. Can you see his signal?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot well from here; but I think I see it.--Now I see him! Pull both.\r\nEasy, Herbert. Oars!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe touched the stairs lightly for a single moment, and he was on board,\r\nand we were off again. He had a boat-cloak with him, and a black canvas\r\nbag; and he looked as like a river-pilot as my heart could have wished.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear boy!\xe2\x80\x9d he said, putting his arm on my shoulder, as he took his\r\nseat. \xe2\x80\x9cFaithful dear boy, well done. Thankye, thankye!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAgain among the tiers of shipping, in and out, avoiding rusty\r\nchain-cables frayed hempen hawsers and bobbing buoys, sinking for the\r\nmoment floating broken baskets, scattering floating chips of wood\r\nand shaving, cleaving floating scum of coal, in and out, under the\r\nfigure-head of the John of Sunderland making a speech to the winds (as\r\nis done by many Johns), and the Betsy of Yarmouth with a firm formality\r\nof bosom and her knobby eyes starting two inches out of her head; in\r\nand out, hammers going in ship-builders\xe2\x80\x99 yards, saws going at timber,\r\nclashing engines going at things unknown, pumps going in leaky ships,\r\ncapstans going, ships going out to sea, and unintelligible sea-creatures\r\nroaring curses over the bulwarks at respondent lightermen, in and\r\nout,--out at last upon the clearer river, where the ships\xe2\x80\x99 boys might\r\ntake their fenders in, no longer fishing in troubled waters with them\r\nover the side, and where the festooned sails might fly out to the wind.\r\n\r\nAt the stairs where we had taken him abroad, and ever since, I had\r\nlooked warily for any token of our being suspected. I had seen none. We\r\ncertainly had not been, and at that time as certainly we were not either\r\nattended or followed by any boat. If we had been waited on by any boat,\r\nI should have run in to shore, and have obliged her to go on, or to\r\nmake her purpose evident. But we held our own without any appearance of\r\nmolestation.\r\n\r\nHe had his boat-cloak on him, and looked, as I have said, a natural part\r\nof the scene. It was remarkable (but perhaps the wretched life he had\r\nled accounted for it) that he was the least anxious of any of us. He\r\nwas not indifferent, for he told me that he hoped to live to see his\r\ngentleman one of the best of gentlemen in a foreign country; he was not\r\ndisposed to be passive or resigned, as I understood it; but he had no\r\nnotion of meeting danger half way. When it came upon him, he confronted\r\nit, but it must come before he troubled himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you knowed, dear boy,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to me, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat it is to sit here\r\nalonger my dear boy and have my smoke, arter having been day by day\r\nbetwixt four walls, you\xe2\x80\x99d envy me. But you don\xe2\x80\x99t know what it is.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think I know the delights of freedom,\xe2\x80\x9d I answered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAh,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, shaking his head gravely. \xe2\x80\x9cBut you don\xe2\x80\x99t know it equal to\r\nme. You must have been under lock and key, dear boy, to know it equal to\r\nme,--but I ain\xe2\x80\x99t a going to be low.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt occurred to me as inconsistent, that, for any mastering idea, he\r\nshould have endangered his freedom, and even his life. But I reflected\r\nthat perhaps freedom without danger was too much apart from all the\r\nhabit of his existence to be to him what it would be to another man. I\r\nwas not far out, since he said, after smoking a little:--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou see, dear boy, when I was over yonder, t\xe2\x80\x99other side the world, I\r\nwas always a looking to this side; and it come flat to be there, for\r\nall I was a growing rich. Everybody knowed Magwitch, and Magwitch could\r\ncome, and Magwitch could go, and nobody\xe2\x80\x99s head would be troubled about\r\nhim. They ain\xe2\x80\x99t so easy concerning me here, dear boy,--wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be,\r\nleastwise, if they knowed where I was.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf all goes well,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cyou will be perfectly free and safe again\r\nwithin a few hours.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d he returned, drawing a long breath, \xe2\x80\x9cI hope so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd think so?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe dipped his hand in the water over the boat\xe2\x80\x99s gunwale, and said,\r\nsmiling with that softened air upon him which was not new to me:--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAy, I s\xe2\x80\x99pose I think so, dear boy. We\xe2\x80\x99d be puzzled to be more quiet\r\nand easy-going than we are at present. But--it\xe2\x80\x99s a flowing so soft\r\nand pleasant through the water, p\xe2\x80\x99raps, as makes me think it--I was\r\na thinking through my smoke just then, that we can no more see to the\r\nbottom of the next few hours than we can see to the bottom of this river\r\nwhat I catches hold of. Nor yet we can\xe2\x80\x99t no more hold their tide than\r\nI can hold this. And it\xe2\x80\x99s run through my fingers and gone, you see!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n holding up his dripping hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut for your face I should think you were a little despondent,\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot a bit on it, dear boy! It comes of flowing on so quiet, and of that\r\nthere rippling at the boat\xe2\x80\x99s head making a sort of a Sunday tune. Maybe\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m a growing a trifle old besides.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe put his pipe back in his mouth with an undisturbed expression of\r\nface, and sat as composed and contented as if we were already out of\r\nEngland. Yet he was as submissive to a word of advice as if he had been\r\nin constant terror; for, when we ran ashore to get some bottles of beer\r\ninto the boat, and he was stepping out, I hinted that I thought he would\r\nbe safest where he was, and he said. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you, dear boy?\xe2\x80\x9d and quietly sat\r\ndown again.\r\n\r\nThe air felt cold upon the river, but it was a bright day, and the\r\nsunshine was very cheering. The tide ran strong, I took care to lose\r\nnone of it, and our steady stroke carried us on thoroughly well. By\r\nimperceptible degrees, as the tide ran out, we lost more and more of the\r\nnearer woods and hills, and dropped lower and lower between the muddy\r\nbanks, but the tide was yet with us when we were off Gravesend. As our\r\ncharge was wrapped in his cloak, I purposely passed within a boat or\r\ntwo\xe2\x80\x99s length of the floating Custom House, and so out to catch the\r\nstream, alongside of two emigrant ships, and under the bows of a large\r\ntransport with troops on the forecastle looking down at us. And soon\r\nthe tide began to slacken, and the craft lying at anchor to swing,\r\nand presently they had all swung round, and the ships that were taking\r\nadvantage of the new tide to get up to the Pool began to crowd upon us\r\nin a fleet, and we kept under the shore, as much out of the strength of\r\nthe tide now as we could, standing carefully off from low shallows and\r\nmudbanks.\r\n\r\nOur oarsmen were so fresh, by dint of having occasionally let her drive\r\nwith the tide for a minute or two, that a quarter of an hour\xe2\x80\x99s rest\r\nproved full as much as they wanted. We got ashore among some slippery\r\nstones while we ate and drank what we had with us, and looked about.\r\nIt was like my own marsh country, flat and monotonous, and with a\r\ndim horizon; while the winding river turned and turned, and the great\r\nfloating buoys upon it turned and turned, and everything else seemed\r\nstranded and still. For now the last of the fleet of ships was round\r\nthe last low point we had headed; and the last green barge, straw-laden,\r\nwith a brown sail, had followed; and some ballast-lighters, shaped like\r\na child\xe2\x80\x99s first rude imitation of a boat, lay low in the mud; and a\r\nlittle squat shoal-lighthouse on open piles stood crippled in the mud\r\non stilts and crutches; and slimy stakes stuck out of the mud, and slimy\r\nstones stuck out of the mud, and red landmarks and tidemarks stuck\r\nout of the mud, and an old landing-stage and an old roofless building\r\nslipped into the mud, and all about us was stagnation and mud.\r\n\r\nWe pushed off again, and made what way we could. It was much harder work\r\nnow, but Herbert and Startop persevered, and rowed and rowed and rowed\r\nuntil the sun went down. By that time the river had lifted us a little,\r\nso that we could see above the bank. There was the red sun, on the low\r\nlevel of the shore, in a purple haze, fast deepening into black; and\r\nthere was the solitary flat marsh; and far away there were the rising\r\ngrounds, between which and us there seemed to be no life, save here and\r\nthere in the foreground a melancholy gull.\r\n\r\nAs the night was fast falling, and as the moon, being past the full,\r\nwould not rise early, we held a little council; a short one, for clearly\r\nour course was to lie by at the first lonely tavern we could find. So,\r\nthey plied their oars once more, and I looked out for anything like a\r\nhouse. Thus we held on, speaking little, for four or five dull miles. It\r\nwas very cold, and, a collier coming by us, with her galley-fire smoking\r\nand flaring, looked like a comfortable home. The night was as dark by\r\nthis time as it would be until morning; and what light we had, seemed\r\nto come more from the river than the sky, as the oars in their dipping\r\nstruck at a few reflected stars.\r\n\r\nAt this dismal time we were evidently all possessed by the idea that\r\nwe were followed. As the tide made, it flapped heavily at irregular\r\nintervals against the shore; and whenever such a sound came, one or\r\nother of us was sure to start, and look in that direction. Here and\r\nthere, the set of the current had worn down the bank into a little\r\ncreek, and we were all suspicious of such places, and eyed them\r\nnervously. Sometimes, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat was that ripple?\xe2\x80\x9d one of us would say in a\r\nlow voice. Or another, \xe2\x80\x9cIs that a boat yonder?\xe2\x80\x9d And afterwards we would\r\nfall into a dead silence, and I would sit impatiently thinking with what\r\nan unusual amount of noise the oars worked in the thowels.\r\n\r\nAt length we descried a light and a roof, and presently afterwards ran\r\nalongside a little causeway made of stones that had been picked up hard\r\nby. Leaving the rest in the boat, I stepped ashore, and found the light\r\nto be in a window of a public-house. It was a dirty place enough, and I\r\ndare say not unknown to smuggling adventurers; but there was a good\r\nfire in the kitchen, and there were eggs and bacon to eat, and various\r\nliquors to drink. Also, there were two double-bedded rooms,--\xe2\x80\x9csuch as\r\nthey were,\xe2\x80\x9d the landlord said. No other company was in the house than\r\nthe landlord, his wife, and a grizzled male creature, the \xe2\x80\x9cJack\xe2\x80\x9d of the\r\nlittle causeway, who was as slimy and smeary as if he had been low-water\r\nmark too.\r\n\r\nWith this assistant, I went down to the boat again, and we all came\r\nashore, and brought out the oars, and rudder and boat-hook, and all\r\nelse, and hauled her up for the night. We made a very good meal by the\r\nkitchen fire, and then apportioned the bedrooms: Herbert and Startop\r\nwere to occupy one; I and our charge the other. We found the air as\r\ncarefully excluded from both, as if air were fatal to life; and there\r\nwere more dirty clothes and bandboxes under the beds than I should have\r\nthought the family possessed. But we considered ourselves well off,\r\nnotwithstanding, for a more solitary place we could not have found.\r\n\r\nWhile we were comforting ourselves by the fire after our meal, the\r\nJack--who was sitting in a corner, and who had a bloated pair of shoes\r\non, which he had exhibited while we were eating our eggs and bacon, as\r\ninteresting relics that he had taken a few days ago from the feet of\r\na drowned seaman washed ashore--asked me if we had seen a four-oared\r\ngalley going up with the tide? When I told him No, he said she must have\r\ngone down then, and yet she \xe2\x80\x9ctook up too,\xe2\x80\x9d when she left there.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey must ha\xe2\x80\x99 thought better on\xe2\x80\x99t for some reason or another,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\nJack, \xe2\x80\x9cand gone down.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA four-oared galley, did you say?\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA four,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Jack, \xe2\x80\x9cand two sitters.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid they come ashore here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey put in with a stone two-gallon jar for some beer. I\xe2\x80\x99d ha\xe2\x80\x99 been\r\nglad to pison the beer myself,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Jack, \xe2\x80\x9cor put some rattling\r\nphysic in it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know why,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Jack. He spoke in a slushy voice, as if much mud\r\nhad washed into his throat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe thinks,\xe2\x80\x9d said the landlord, a weakly meditative man with a pale eye,\r\nwho seemed to rely greatly on his Jack,--\xe2\x80\x9che thinks they was, what they\r\nwasn\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI knows what I thinks,\xe2\x80\x9d observed the Jack.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou thinks Custum \xe2\x80\x98Us, Jack?\xe2\x80\x9d said the landlord.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Jack.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThen you\xe2\x80\x99re wrong, Jack.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAM I!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIn the infinite meaning of his reply and his boundless confidence in\r\nhis views, the Jack took one of his bloated shoes off, looked into\r\nit, knocked a few stones out of it on the kitchen floor, and put it on\r\nagain. He did this with the air of a Jack who was so right that he could\r\nafford to do anything.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, what do you make out that they done with their buttons then,\r\nJack?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the landlord, vacillating weakly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDone with their buttons?\xe2\x80\x9d returned the Jack. \xe2\x80\x9cChucked \xe2\x80\x98em overboard.\r\nSwallered \xe2\x80\x98em. Sowed \xe2\x80\x98em, to come up small salad. Done with their\r\nbuttons!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t be cheeky, Jack,\xe2\x80\x9d remonstrated the landlord, in a melancholy and\r\npathetic way.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA Custum \xe2\x80\x98Us officer knows what to do with his Buttons,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Jack,\r\nrepeating the obnoxious word with the greatest contempt, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen they\r\ncomes betwixt him and his own light. A four and two sitters don\xe2\x80\x99t go\r\nhanging and hovering, up with one tide and down with another, and both\r\nwith and against another, without there being Custum \xe2\x80\x98Us at the bottom\r\nof it.\xe2\x80\x9d Saying which he went out in disdain; and the landlord, having no\r\none to reply upon, found it impracticable to pursue the subject.\r\n\r\nThis dialogue made us all uneasy, and me very uneasy. The dismal wind\r\nwas muttering round the house, the tide was flapping at the shore, and\r\nI had a feeling that we were caged and threatened. A four-oared galley\r\nhovering about in so unusual a way as to attract this notice was an ugly\r\ncircumstance that I could not get rid of. When I had induced Provis to\r\ngo up to bed, I went outside with my two companions (Startop by this\r\ntime knew the state of the case), and held another council. Whether we\r\nshould remain at the house until near the steamer\xe2\x80\x99s time, which would\r\nbe about one in the afternoon, or whether we should put off early in the\r\nmorning, was the question we discussed. On the whole we deemed it the\r\nbetter course to lie where we were, until within an hour or so of the\r\nsteamer\xe2\x80\x99s time, and then to get out in her track, and drift easily with\r\nthe tide. Having settled to do this, we returned into the house and went\r\nto bed.\r\n\r\nI lay down with the greater part of my clothes on, and slept well for a\r\nfew hours. When I awoke, the wind had risen, and the sign of the house\r\n(the Ship) was creaking and banging about, with noises that startled\r\nme. Rising softly, for my charge lay fast asleep, I looked out of the\r\nwindow. It commanded the causeway where we had hauled up our boat, and,\r\nas my eyes adapted themselves to the light of the clouded moon, I saw\r\ntwo men looking into her. They passed by under the window, looking at\r\nnothing else, and they did not go down to the landing-place which I\r\ncould discern to be empty, but struck across the marsh in the direction\r\nof the Nore.\r\n\r\nMy first impulse was to call up Herbert, and show him the two men going\r\naway. But reflecting, before I got into his room, which was at the back\r\nof the house and adjoined mine, that he and Startop had had a harder day\r\nthan I, and were fatigued, I forbore. Going back to my window, I could\r\nsee the two men moving over the marsh. In that light, however, I soon\r\nlost them, and, feeling very cold, lay down to think of the matter, and\r\nfell asleep again.\r\n\r\nWe were up early. As we walked to and fro, all four together, before\r\nbreakfast, I deemed it right to recount what I had seen. Again our\r\ncharge was the least anxious of the party. It was very likely that the\r\nmen belonged to the Custom House, he said quietly, and that they had no\r\nthought of us. I tried to persuade myself that it was so,--as, indeed,\r\nit might easily be. However, I proposed that he and I should walk away\r\ntogether to a distant point we could see, and that the boat should take\r\nus aboard there, or as near there as might prove feasible, at about\r\nnoon. This being considered a good precaution, soon after breakfast he\r\nand I set forth, without saying anything at the tavern.\r\n\r\nHe smoked his pipe as we went along, and sometimes stopped to clap me on\r\nthe shoulder. One would have supposed that it was I who was in danger,\r\nnot he, and that he was reassuring me. We spoke very little. As we\r\napproached the point, I begged him to remain in a sheltered place, while\r\nI went on to reconnoitre; for it was towards it that the men had passed\r\nin the night. He complied, and I went on alone. There was no boat off\r\nthe point, nor any boat drawn up anywhere near it, nor were there any\r\nsigns of the men having embarked there. But, to be sure, the tide was\r\nhigh, and there might have been some footpints under water.\r\n\r\nWhen he looked out from his shelter in the distance, and saw that I\r\nwaved my hat to him to come up, he rejoined me, and there we waited;\r\nsometimes lying on the bank, wrapped in our coats, and sometimes moving\r\nabout to warm ourselves, until we saw our boat coming round. We got\r\naboard easily, and rowed out into the track of the steamer. By that time\r\nit wanted but ten minutes of one o\xe2\x80\x99clock, and we began to look out for\r\nher smoke.\r\n\r\nBut, it was half-past one before we saw her smoke, and soon afterwards\r\nwe saw behind it the smoke of another steamer. As they were coming on\r\nat full speed, we got the two bags ready, and took that opportunity\r\nof saying good-bye to Herbert and Startop. We had all shaken hands\r\ncordially, and neither Herbert\xe2\x80\x99s eyes nor mine were quite dry, when I\r\nsaw a four-oared galley shoot out from under the bank but a little way\r\nahead of us, and row out into the same track.\r\n\r\nA stretch of shore had been as yet between us and the steamer\xe2\x80\x99s smoke,\r\nby reason of the bend and wind of the river; but now she was visible,\r\ncoming head on. I called to Herbert and Startop to keep before the tide,\r\nthat she might see us lying by for her, and I adjured Provis to sit\r\nquite still, wrapped in his cloak. He answered cheerily, \xe2\x80\x9cTrust to me,\r\ndear boy,\xe2\x80\x9d and sat like a statue. Meantime the galley, which was very\r\nskilfully handled, had crossed us, let us come up with her, and fallen\r\nalongside. Leaving just room enough for the play of the oars, she kept\r\nalongside, drifting when we drifted, and pulling a stroke or two when we\r\npulled. Of the two sitters one held the rudder-lines, and looked at us\r\nattentively,--as did all the rowers; the other sitter was wrapped up,\r\nmuch as Provis was, and seemed to shrink, and whisper some instruction\r\nto the steerer as he looked at us. Not a word was spoken in either boat.\r\n\r\nStartop could make out, after a few minutes, which steamer was first,\r\nand gave me the word \xe2\x80\x9cHamburg,\xe2\x80\x9d in a low voice, as we sat face to face.\r\nShe was nearing us very fast, and the beating of her peddles grew louder\r\nand louder. I felt as if her shadow were absolutely upon us, when the\r\ngalley hailed us. I answered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have a returned Transport there,\xe2\x80\x9d said the man who held the lines.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s the man, wrapped in the cloak. His name is Abel Magwitch,\r\notherwise Provis. I apprehend that man, and call upon him to surrender,\r\nand you to assist.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt the same moment, without giving any audible direction to his crew,\r\nhe ran the galley abroad of us. They had pulled one sudden stroke ahead,\r\nhad got their oars in, had run athwart us, and were holding on to\r\nour gunwale, before we knew what they were doing. This caused great\r\nconfusion on board the steamer, and I heard them calling to us, and\r\nheard the order given to stop the paddles, and heard them stop, but felt\r\nher driving down upon us irresistibly. In the same moment, I saw the\r\nsteersman of the galley lay his hand on his prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder, and saw\r\nthat both boats were swinging round with the force of the tide, and\r\nsaw that all hands on board the steamer were running forward quite\r\nfrantically. Still, in the same moment, I saw the prisoner start\r\nup, lean across his captor, and pull the cloak from the neck of the\r\nshrinking sitter in the galley. Still in the same moment, I saw that the\r\nface disclosed, was the face of the other convict of long ago. Still, in\r\nthe same moment, I saw the face tilt backward with a white terror on it\r\nthat I shall never forget, and heard a great cry on board the steamer,\r\nand a loud splash in the water, and felt the boat sink from under me.\r\n\r\nIt was but for an instant that I seemed to struggle with a thousand\r\nmill-weirs and a thousand flashes of light; that instant past, I was\r\ntaken on board the galley. Herbert was there, and Startop was there; but\r\nour boat was gone, and the two convicts were gone.\r\n\r\nWhat with the cries aboard the steamer, and the furious blowing off of\r\nher steam, and her driving on, and our driving on, I could not at first\r\ndistinguish sky from water or shore from shore; but the crew of the\r\ngalley righted her with great speed, and, pulling certain swift strong\r\nstrokes ahead, lay upon their oars, every man looking silently and\r\neagerly at the water astern. Presently a dark object was seen in it,\r\nbearing towards us on the tide. No man spoke, but the steersman held up\r\nhis hand, and all softly backed water, and kept the boat straight and\r\ntrue before it. As it came nearer, I saw it to be Magwitch, swimming,\r\nbut not swimming freely. He was taken on board, and instantly manacled\r\nat the wrists and ankles.\r\n\r\nThe galley was kept steady, and the silent, eager look-out at the water\r\nwas resumed. But, the Rotterdam steamer now came up, and apparently not\r\nunderstanding what had happened, came on at speed. By the time she had\r\nbeen hailed and stopped, both steamers were drifting away from us, and\r\nwe were rising and falling in a troubled wake of water. The look-out was\r\nkept, long after all was still again and the two steamers were gone; but\r\neverybody knew that it was hopeless now.\r\n\r\nAt length we gave it up, and pulled under the shore towards the tavern\r\nwe had lately left, where we were received with no little surprise. Here\r\nI was able to get some comforts for Magwitch,--Provis no longer,--who\r\nhad received some very severe injury in the Chest, and a deep cut in the\r\nhead.\r\n\r\nHe told me that he believed himself to have gone under the keel of the\r\nsteamer, and to have been struck on the head in rising. The injury to\r\nhis chest (which rendered his breathing extremely painful) he thought\r\nhe had received against the side of the galley. He added that he did not\r\npretend to say what he might or might not have done to Compeyson, but\r\nthat, in the moment of his laying his hand on his cloak to identify him,\r\nthat villain had staggered up and staggered back, and they had both gone\r\noverboard together, when the sudden wrenching of him (Magwitch) out of\r\nour boat, and the endeavor of his captor to keep him in it, had capsized\r\nus. He told me in a whisper that they had gone down fiercely locked in\r\neach other\xe2\x80\x99s arms, and that there had been a struggle under water, and\r\nthat he had disengaged himself, struck out, and swum away.\r\n\r\nI never had any reason to doubt the exact truth of what he thus told me.\r\nThe officer who steered the galley gave the same account of their going\r\noverboard.\r\n\r\nWhen I asked this officer\xe2\x80\x99s permission to change the prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwet clothes by purchasing any spare garments I could get at the\r\npublic-house, he gave it readily: merely observing that he must take\r\ncharge of everything his prisoner had about him. So the pocket-book\r\nwhich had once been in my hands passed into the officer\xe2\x80\x99s. He further\r\ngave me leave to accompany the prisoner to London; but declined to\r\naccord that grace to my two friends.\r\n\r\nThe Jack at the Ship was instructed where the drowned man had gone\r\ndown, and undertook to search for the body in the places where it was\r\nlikeliest to come ashore. His interest in its recovery seemed to me to\r\nbe much heightened when he heard that it had stockings on. Probably, it\r\ntook about a dozen drowned men to fit him out completely; and that may\r\nhave been the reason why the different articles of his dress were in\r\nvarious stages of decay.\r\n\r\nWe remained at the public-house until the tide turned, and then Magwitch\r\nwas carried down to the galley and put on board. Herbert and Startop\r\nwere to get to London by land, as soon as they could. We had a doleful\r\nparting, and when I took my place by Magwitch\xe2\x80\x99s side, I felt that that\r\nwas my place henceforth while he lived.\r\n\r\nFor now, my repugnance to him had all melted away; and in the hunted,\r\nwounded, shackled creature who held my hand in his, I only saw a man\r\nwho had meant to be my benefactor, and who had felt affectionately,\r\ngratefully, and generously, towards me with great constancy through a\r\nseries of years. I only saw in him a much better man than I had been to\r\nJoe.\r\n\r\nHis breathing became more difficult and painful as the night drew on,\r\nand often he could not repress a groan. I tried to rest him on the arm\r\nI could use, in any easy position; but it was dreadful to think that\r\nI could not be sorry at heart for his being badly hurt, since it was\r\nunquestionably best that he should die. That there were, still living,\r\npeople enough who were able and willing to identify him, I could not\r\ndoubt. That he would be leniently treated, I could not hope. He who had\r\nbeen presented in the worst light at his trial, who had since broken\r\nprison and had been tried again, who had returned from transportation\r\nunder a life sentence, and who had occasioned the death of the man who\r\nwas the cause of his arrest.\r\n\r\nAs we returned towards the setting sun we had yesterday left behind us,\r\nand as the stream of our hopes seemed all running back, I told him how\r\ngrieved I was to think that he had come home for my sake.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear boy,\xe2\x80\x9d he answered, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m quite content to take my chance. I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen\r\nmy boy, and he can be a gentleman without me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNo. I had thought about that, while we had been there side by side. No.\r\nApart from any inclinations of my own, I understood Wemmick\xe2\x80\x99s hint now.\r\nI foresaw that, being convicted, his possessions would be forfeited to\r\nthe Crown.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLookee here, dear boy,\xe2\x80\x9d said he \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s best as a gentleman should not be\r\nknowed to belong to me now. Only come to see me as if you come by chance\r\nalonger Wemmick. Sit where I can see you when I am swore to, for the\r\nlast o\xe2\x80\x99 many times, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t ask no more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will never stir from your side,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen I am suffered to be\r\nnear you. Please God, I will be as true to you as you have been to me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI felt his hand tremble as it held mine, and he turned his face away\r\nas he lay in the bottom of the boat, and I heard that old sound in his\r\nthroat,--softened now, like all the rest of him. It was a good thing\r\nthat he had touched this point, for it put into my mind what I might not\r\notherwise have thought of until too late,--that he need never know how\r\nhis hopes of enriching me had perished.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter LV\r\n\r\nHe was taken to the Police Court next day, and would have been\r\nimmediately committed for trial, but that it was necessary to send down\r\nfor an old officer of the prison-ship from which he had once escaped, to\r\nspeak to his identity. Nobody doubted it; but Compeyson, who had meant\r\nto depose to it, was tumbling on the tides, dead, and it happened that\r\nthere was not at that time any prison officer in London who could give\r\nthe required evidence. I had gone direct to Mr. Jaggers at his private\r\nhouse, on my arrival over night, to retain his assistance, and Mr.\r\nJaggers on the prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s behalf would admit nothing. It was the sole\r\nresource; for he told me that the case must be over in five minutes\r\nwhen the witness was there, and that no power on earth could prevent its\r\ngoing against us.\r\n\r\nI imparted to Mr. Jaggers my design of keeping him in ignorance of the\r\nfate of his wealth. Mr. Jaggers was querulous and angry with me for\r\nhaving \xe2\x80\x9clet it slip through my fingers,\xe2\x80\x9d and said we must memorialize\r\nby and by, and try at all events for some of it. But he did not conceal\r\nfrom me that, although there might be many cases in which the forfeiture\r\nwould not be exacted, there were no circumstances in this case to make\r\nit one of them. I understood that very well. I was not related to the\r\noutlaw, or connected with him by any recognizable tie; he had put his\r\nhand to no writing or settlement in my favor before his apprehension,\r\nand to do so now would be idle. I had no claim, and I finally resolved,\r\nand ever afterwards abided by the resolution, that my heart should never\r\nbe sickened with the hopeless task of attempting to establish one.\r\n\r\nThere appeared to be reason for supposing that the drowned informer\r\nhad hoped for a reward out of this forfeiture, and had obtained some\r\naccurate knowledge of Magwitch\xe2\x80\x99s affairs. When his body was found, many\r\nmiles from the scene of his death, and so horribly disfigured that he\r\nwas only recognizable by the contents of his pockets, notes were still\r\nlegible, folded in a case he carried. Among these were the name of a\r\nbanking-house in New South Wales, where a sum of money was, and the\r\ndesignation of certain lands of considerable value. Both these heads of\r\ninformation were in a list that Magwitch, while in prison, gave to Mr.\r\nJaggers, of the possessions he supposed I should inherit. His ignorance,\r\npoor fellow, at last served him; he never mistrusted but that my\r\ninheritance was quite safe, with Mr. Jaggers\xe2\x80\x99s aid.\r\n\r\nAfter three days\xe2\x80\x99 delay, during which the crown prosecution stood over\r\nfor the production of the witness from the prison-ship, the witness\r\ncame, and completed the easy case. He was committed to take his trial at\r\nthe next Sessions, which would come on in a month.\r\n\r\nIt was at this dark time of my life that Herbert returned home one\r\nevening, a good deal cast down, and said,--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear Handel, I fear I shall soon have to leave you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHis partner having prepared me for that, I was less surprised than he\r\nthought.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe shall lose a fine opportunity if I put off going to Cairo, and I am\r\nvery much afraid I must go, Handel, when you most need me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHerbert, I shall always need you, because I shall always love you; but\r\nmy need is no greater now than at another time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou will be so lonely.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have not leisure to think of that,\xe2\x80\x9d said I. \xe2\x80\x9cYou know that I am\r\nalways with him to the full extent of the time allowed, and that I\r\nshould be with him all day long, if I could. And when I come away from\r\nhim, you know that my thoughts are with him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe dreadful condition to which he was brought, was so appalling to both\r\nof us, that we could not refer to it in plainer words.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear fellow,\xe2\x80\x9d said Herbert, \xe2\x80\x9clet the near prospect of our\r\nseparation--for, it is very near--be my justification for troubling you\r\nabout yourself. Have you thought of your future?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, for I have been afraid to think of any future.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut yours cannot be dismissed; indeed, my dear dear Handel, it must not\r\nbe dismissed. I wish you would enter on it now, as far as a few friendly\r\nwords go, with me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI will,\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn this branch house of ours, Handel, we must have a--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI saw that his delicacy was avoiding the right word, so I said, \xe2\x80\x9cA\r\nclerk.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA clerk. And I hope it is not at all unlikely that he may expand (as\r\na clerk of your acquaintance has expanded) into a partner. Now,\r\nHandel,--in short, my dear boy, will you come to me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was something charmingly cordial and engaging in the manner in\r\nwhich after saying \xe2\x80\x9cNow, Handel,\xe2\x80\x9d as if it were the grave beginning of\r\na portentous business exordium, he had suddenly given up that tone,\r\nstretched out his honest hand, and spoken like a schoolboy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cClara and I have talked about it again and again,\xe2\x80\x9d Herbert pursued,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cand the dear little thing begged me only this evening, with tears in\r\nher eyes, to say to you that, if you will live with us when we come\r\ntogether, she will do her best to make you happy, and to convince her\r\nhusband\xe2\x80\x99s friend that he is her friend too. We should get on so well,\r\nHandel!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI thanked her heartily, and I thanked him heartily, but said I could not\r\nyet make sure of joining him as he so kindly offered. Firstly, my\r\nmind was too preoccupied to be able to take in the subject clearly.\r\nSecondly,--Yes! Secondly, there was a vague something lingering in my\r\nthoughts that will come out very near the end of this slight narrative.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut if you thought, Herbert, that you could, without doing any injury\r\nto your business, leave the question open for a little while--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor any while,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Herbert. \xe2\x80\x9cSix months, a year!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot so long as that,\xe2\x80\x9d said I. \xe2\x80\x9cTwo or three months at most.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHerbert was highly delighted when we shook hands on this arrangement,\r\nand said he could now take courage to tell me that he believed he must\r\ngo away at the end of the week.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd Clara?\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe dear little thing,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Herbert, \xe2\x80\x9cholds dutifully to her\r\nfather as long as he lasts; but he won\xe2\x80\x99t last long. Mrs. Whimple\r\nconfides to me that he is certainly going.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot to say an unfeeling thing,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9che cannot do better than go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am afraid that must be admitted,\xe2\x80\x9d said Herbert; \xe2\x80\x9cand then I shall\r\ncome back for the dear little thing, and the dear little thing and I\r\nwill walk quietly into the nearest church. Remember! The blessed darling\r\ncomes of no family, my dear Handel, and never looked into the red book,\r\nand hasn\xe2\x80\x99t a notion about her grandpapa. What a fortune for the son of\r\nmy mother!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nOn the Saturday in that same week, I took my leave of Herbert,--full\r\nof bright hope, but sad and sorry to leave me,--as he sat on one of the\r\nseaport mail coaches. I went into a coffee-house to write a little note\r\nto Clara, telling her he had gone off, sending his love to her over and\r\nover again, and then went to my lonely home,--if it deserved the name;\r\nfor it was now no home to me, and I had no home anywhere.\r\n\r\nOn the stairs I encountered Wemmick, who was coming down, after an\r\nunsuccessful application of his knuckles to my door. I had not seen him\r\nalone since the disastrous issue of the attempted flight; and he had\r\ncome, in his private and personal capacity, to say a few words of\r\nexplanation in reference to that failure.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe late Compeyson,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wemmick, \xe2\x80\x9chad by little and little got at the\r\nbottom of half of the regular business now transacted; and it was from\r\nthe talk of some of his people in trouble (some of his people being\r\nalways in trouble) that I heard what I did. I kept my ears open, seeming\r\nto have them shut, until I heard that he was absent, and I thought that\r\nwould be the best time for making the attempt. I can only suppose now,\r\nthat it was a part of his policy, as a very clever man, habitually to\r\ndeceive his own instruments. You don\xe2\x80\x99t blame me, I hope, Mr. Pip? I am\r\nsure I tried to serve you, with all my heart.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am as sure of that, Wemmick, as you can be, and I thank you most\r\nearnestly for all your interest and friendship.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you, thank you very much. It\xe2\x80\x99s a bad job,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wemmick,\r\nscratching his head, \xe2\x80\x9cand I assure you I haven\xe2\x80\x99t been so cut up for a\r\nlong time. What I look at is the sacrifice of so much portable property.\r\nDear me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat I think of, Wemmick, is the poor owner of the property.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, to be sure,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wemmick. \xe2\x80\x9cOf course, there can be no objection\r\nto your being sorry for him, and I\xe2\x80\x99d put down a five-pound note myself\r\nto get him out of it. But what I look at is this. The late Compeyson\r\nhaving been beforehand with him in intelligence of his return, and being\r\nso determined to bring him to book, I do not think he could have been\r\nsaved. Whereas, the portable property certainly could have been saved.\r\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s the difference between the property and the owner, don\xe2\x80\x99t you\r\nsee?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI invited Wemmick to come upstairs, and refresh himself with a glass\r\nof grog before walking to Walworth. He accepted the invitation. While he\r\nwas drinking his moderate allowance, he said, with nothing to lead up to\r\nit, and after having appeared rather fidgety,--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you think of my meaning to take a holiday on Monday, Mr. Pip?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, I suppose you have not done such a thing these twelve months.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThese twelve years, more likely,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wemmick. \xe2\x80\x9cYes. I\xe2\x80\x99m going to take\r\na holiday. More than that; I\xe2\x80\x99m going to take a walk. More than that; I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\ngoing to ask you to take a walk with me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI was about to excuse myself, as being but a bad companion just then,\r\nwhen Wemmick anticipated me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI know your engagements,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cand I know you are out of sorts,\r\nMr. Pip. But if you could oblige me, I should take it as a kindness.\r\nIt ain\xe2\x80\x99t a long walk, and it\xe2\x80\x99s an early one. Say it might occupy you\r\n(including breakfast on the walk) from eight to twelve. Couldn\xe2\x80\x99t you\r\nstretch a point and manage it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had done so much for me at various times, that this was very little\r\nto do for him. I said I could manage it,--would manage it,--and he was\r\nso very much pleased by my acquiescence, that I was pleased too. At his\r\nparticular request, I appointed to call for him at the Castle at half\r\npast eight on Monday morning, and so we parted for the time.\r\n\r\nPunctual to my appointment, I rang at the Castle gate on the Monday\r\nmorning, and was received by Wemmick himself, who struck me as looking\r\ntighter than usual, and having a sleeker hat on. Within, there were two\r\nglasses of rum and milk prepared, and two biscuits. The Aged must have\r\nbeen stirring with the lark, for, glancing into the perspective of his\r\nbedroom, I observed that his bed was empty.\r\n\r\nWhen we had fortified ourselves with the rum and milk and biscuits, and\r\nwere going out for the walk with that training preparation on us, I was\r\nconsiderably surprised to see Wemmick take up a fishing-rod, and put\r\nit over his shoulder. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, we are not going fishing!\xe2\x80\x9d said I. \xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n returned Wemmick, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I like to walk with one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI thought this odd; however, I said nothing, and we set off. We went\r\ntowards Camberwell Green, and when we were thereabouts, Wemmick said\r\nsuddenly,--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHalloa! Here\xe2\x80\x99s a church!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere was nothing very surprising in that; but again, I was rather\r\nsurprised, when he said, as if he were animated by a brilliant idea,--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s go in!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe went in, Wemmick leaving his fishing-rod in the porch, and looked all\r\nround. In the mean time, Wemmick was diving into his coat-pockets, and\r\ngetting something out of paper there.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHalloa!\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cHere\xe2\x80\x99s a couple of pair of gloves! Let\xe2\x80\x99s put \xe2\x80\x98em\r\non!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs the gloves were white kid gloves, and as the post-office was widened\r\nto its utmost extent, I now began to have my strong suspicions. They\r\nwere strengthened into certainty when I beheld the Aged enter at a side\r\ndoor, escorting a lady.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHalloa!\xe2\x80\x9d said Wemmick. \xe2\x80\x9cHere\xe2\x80\x99s Miss Skiffins! Let\xe2\x80\x99s have a wedding.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThat discreet damsel was attired as usual, except that she was now\r\nengaged in substituting for her green kid gloves a pair of white. The\r\nAged was likewise occupied in preparing a similar sacrifice for\r\nthe altar of Hymen. The old gentleman, however, experienced so much\r\ndifficulty in getting his gloves on, that Wemmick found it necessary\r\nto put him with his back against a pillar, and then to get behind the\r\npillar himself and pull away at them, while I for my part held the old\r\ngentleman round the waist, that he might present an equal and safe\r\nresistance. By dint of this ingenious scheme, his gloves were got on to\r\nperfection.\r\n\r\nThe clerk and clergyman then appearing, we were ranged in order at\r\nthose fatal rails. True to his notion of seeming to do it all without\r\npreparation, I heard Wemmick say to himself, as he took something out of\r\nhis waistcoat-pocket before the service began, \xe2\x80\x9cHalloa! Here\xe2\x80\x99s a ring!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI acted in the capacity of backer, or best-man, to the bridegroom; while\r\na little limp pew-opener in a soft bonnet like a baby\xe2\x80\x99s, made a feint\r\nof being the bosom friend of Miss Skiffins. The responsibility of giving\r\nthe lady away devolved upon the Aged, which led to the clergyman\xe2\x80\x99s being\r\nunintentionally scandalized, and it happened thus. When he said, \xe2\x80\x9cWho\r\ngiveth this woman to be married to this man?\xe2\x80\x9d the old gentleman, not in\r\nthe least knowing what point of the ceremony we had arrived at, stood\r\nmost amiably beaming at the ten commandments. Upon which, the clergyman\r\nsaid again, \xe2\x80\x9cWHO giveth this woman to be married to this man?\xe2\x80\x9d The old\r\ngentleman being still in a state of most estimable unconsciousness, the\r\nbridegroom cried out in his accustomed voice, \xe2\x80\x9cNow Aged P. you know; who\r\ngiveth?\xe2\x80\x9d To which the Aged replied with great briskness, before saying\r\nthat he gave, \xe2\x80\x9cAll right, John, all right, my boy!\xe2\x80\x9d And the clergyman\r\ncame to so gloomy a pause upon it, that I had doubts for the moment\r\nwhether we should get completely married that day.\r\n\r\nIt was completely done, however, and when we were going out of church\r\nWemmick took the cover off the font, and put his white gloves in it, and\r\nput the cover on again. Mrs. Wemmick, more heedful of the future, put\r\nher white gloves in her pocket and assumed her green. \xe2\x80\x9cNow, Mr. Pip,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n said Wemmick, triumphantly shouldering the fishing-rod as we came\r\nout, \xe2\x80\x9clet me ask you whether anybody would suppose this to be a\r\nwedding-party!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBreakfast had been ordered at a pleasant little tavern, a mile or so\r\naway upon the rising ground beyond the green; and there was a bagatelle\r\nboard in the room, in case we should desire to unbend our minds after\r\nthe solemnity. It was pleasant to observe that Mrs. Wemmick no longer\r\nunwound Wemmick\xe2\x80\x99s arm when it adapted itself to her figure, but sat in a\r\nhigh-backed chair against the wall, like a violoncello in its case, and\r\nsubmitted to be embraced as that melodious instrument might have done.\r\n\r\nWe had an excellent breakfast, and when any one declined anything on\r\ntable, Wemmick said, \xe2\x80\x9cProvided by contract, you know; don\xe2\x80\x99t be afraid of\r\nit!\xe2\x80\x9d I drank to the new couple, drank to the Aged, drank to the Castle,\r\nsaluted the bride at parting, and made myself as agreeable as I could.\r\n\r\nWemmick came down to the door with me, and I again shook hands with him,\r\nand wished him joy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThankee!\xe2\x80\x9d said Wemmick, rubbing his hands. \xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s such a manager\r\nof fowls, you have no idea. You shall have some eggs, and judge for\r\nyourself. I say, Mr. Pip!\xe2\x80\x9d calling me back, and speaking low. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is\r\naltogether a Walworth sentiment, please.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI understand. Not to be mentioned in Little Britain,\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\nWemmick nodded. \xe2\x80\x9cAfter what you let out the other day, Mr. Jaggers\r\nmay as well not know of it. He might think my brain was softening, or\r\nsomething of the kind.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter LVI\r\n\r\nHe lay in prison very ill, during the whole interval between his\r\ncommittal for trial and the coming round of the Sessions. He had broken\r\ntwo ribs, they had wounded one of his lungs, and he breathed with great\r\npain and difficulty, which increased daily. It was a consequence of his\r\nhurt that he spoke so low as to be scarcely audible; therefore he spoke\r\nvery little. But he was ever ready to listen to me; and it became the\r\nfirst duty of my life to say to him, and read to him, what I knew he\r\nought to hear.\r\n\r\nBeing far too ill to remain in the common prison, he was removed, after\r\nthe first day or so, into the infirmary. This gave me opportunities\r\nof being with him that I could not otherwise have had. And but for\r\nhis illness he would have been put in irons, for he was regarded as a\r\ndetermined prison-breaker, and I know not what else.\r\n\r\nAlthough I saw him every day, it was for only a short time; hence, the\r\nregularly recurring spaces of our separation were long enough to record\r\non his face any slight changes that occurred in his physical state. I\r\ndo not recollect that I once saw any change in it for the better; he\r\nwasted, and became slowly weaker and worse, day by day, from the day\r\nwhen the prison door closed upon him.\r\n\r\nThe kind of submission or resignation that he showed was that of a man\r\nwho was tired out. I sometimes derived an impression, from his manner\r\nor from a whispered word or two which escaped him, that he pondered\r\nover the question whether he might have been a better man under better\r\ncircumstances. But he never justified himself by a hint tending that\r\nway, or tried to bend the past out of its eternal shape.\r\n\r\nIt happened on two or three occasions in my presence, that his desperate\r\nreputation was alluded to by one or other of the people in attendance on\r\nhim. A smile crossed his face then, and he turned his eyes on me with\r\na trustful look, as if he were confident that I had seen some small\r\nredeeming touch in him, even so long ago as when I was a little child.\r\nAs to all the rest, he was humble and contrite, and I never knew him\r\ncomplain.\r\n\r\nWhen the Sessions came round, Mr. Jaggers caused an application to be\r\nmade for the postponement of his trial until the following Sessions. It\r\nwas obviously made with the assurance that he could not live so long,\r\nand was refused. The trial came on at once, and, when he was put to the\r\nbar, he was seated in a chair. No objection was made to my getting\r\nclose to the dock, on the outside of it, and holding the hand that he\r\nstretched forth to me.\r\n\r\nThe trial was very short and very clear. Such things as could be said\r\nfor him were said,--how he had taken to industrious habits, and had\r\nthriven lawfully and reputably. But nothing could unsay the fact that\r\nhe had returned, and was there in presence of the Judge and Jury. It was\r\nimpossible to try him for that, and do otherwise than find him guilty.\r\n\r\nAt that time, it was the custom (as I learnt from my terrible experience\r\nof that Sessions) to devote a concluding day to the passing of\r\nSentences, and to make a finishing effect with the Sentence of Death.\r\nBut for the indelible picture that my remembrance now holds before me,\r\nI could scarcely believe, even as I write these words, that I saw\r\ntwo-and-thirty men and women put before the Judge to receive that\r\nsentence together. Foremost among the two-and-thirty was he; seated,\r\nthat he might get breath enough to keep life in him.\r\n\r\nThe whole scene starts out again in the vivid colors of the moment, down\r\nto the drops of April rain on the windows of the court, glittering in\r\nthe rays of April sun. Penned in the dock, as I again stood outside it\r\nat the corner with his hand in mine, were the two-and-thirty men\r\nand women; some defiant, some stricken with terror, some sobbing and\r\nweeping, some covering their faces, some staring gloomily about. There\r\nhad been shrieks from among the women convicts; but they had been\r\nstilled, and a hush had succeeded. The sheriffs with their great chains\r\nand nosegays, other civic gewgaws and monsters, criers, ushers, a great\r\ngallery full of people,--a large theatrical audience,--looked on, as the\r\ntwo-and-thirty and the Judge were solemnly confronted. Then the Judge\r\naddressed them. Among the wretched creatures before him whom he must\r\nsingle out for special address was one who almost from his infancy had\r\nbeen an offender against the laws; who, after repeated imprisonments and\r\npunishments, had been at length sentenced to exile for a term of years;\r\nand who, under circumstances of great violence and daring, had made his\r\nescape and been re-sentenced to exile for life. That miserable man would\r\nseem for a time to have become convinced of his errors, when far removed\r\nfrom the scenes of his old offences, and to have lived a peaceable and\r\nhonest life. But in a fatal moment, yielding to those propensities and\r\npassions, the indulgence of which had so long rendered him a scourge to\r\nsociety, he had quitted his haven of rest and repentance, and had\r\ncome back to the country where he was proscribed. Being here presently\r\ndenounced, he had for a time succeeded in evading the officers of\r\nJustice, but being at length seized while in the act of flight, he had\r\nresisted them, and had--he best knew whether by express design, or in\r\nthe blindness of his hardihood--caused the death of his denouncer, to\r\nwhom his whole career was known. The appointed punishment for his return\r\nto the land that had cast him out, being Death, and his case being this\r\naggravated case, he must prepare himself to Die.\r\n\r\nThe sun was striking in at the great windows of the court, through the\r\nglittering drops of rain upon the glass, and it made a broad shaft of\r\nlight between the two-and-thirty and the Judge, linking both together,\r\nand perhaps reminding some among the audience how both were passing on,\r\nwith absolute equality, to the greater Judgment that knoweth all things,\r\nand cannot err. Rising for a moment, a distinct speck of face in this\r\nway of light, the prisoner said, \xe2\x80\x9cMy Lord, I have received my sentence\r\nof Death from the Almighty, but I bow to yours,\xe2\x80\x9d and sat down again.\r\nThere was some hushing, and the Judge went on with what he had to say\r\nto the rest. Then they were all formally doomed, and some of them were\r\nsupported out, and some of them sauntered out with a haggard look of\r\nbravery, and a few nodded to the gallery, and two or three shook hands,\r\nand others went out chewing the fragments of herb they had taken from\r\nthe sweet herbs lying about. He went last of all, because of having to\r\nbe helped from his chair, and to go very slowly; and he held my hand\r\nwhile all the others were removed, and while the audience got up\r\n(putting their dresses right, as they might at church or elsewhere), and\r\npointed down at this criminal or at that, and most of all at him and me.\r\n\r\nI earnestly hoped and prayed that he might die before the Recorder\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nReport was made; but, in the dread of his lingering on, I began that\r\nnight to write out a petition to the Home Secretary of State, setting\r\nforth my knowledge of him, and how it was that he had come back for my\r\nsake. I wrote it as fervently and pathetically as I could; and when I\r\nhad finished it and sent it in, I wrote out other petitions to such men\r\nin authority as I hoped were the most merciful, and drew up one to the\r\nCrown itself. For several days and nights after he was sentenced I took\r\nno rest except when I fell asleep in my chair, but was wholly absorbed\r\nin these appeals. And after I had sent them in, I could not keep away\r\nfrom the places where they were, but felt as if they were more\r\nhopeful and less desperate when I was near them. In this unreasonable\r\nrestlessness and pain of mind I would roam the streets of an evening,\r\nwandering by those offices and houses where I had left the petitions. To\r\nthe present hour, the weary western streets of London on a cold, dusty\r\nspring night, with their ranges of stern, shut-up mansions, and their\r\nlong rows of lamps, are melancholy to me from this association.\r\n\r\nThe daily visits I could make him were shortened now, and he was more\r\nstrictly kept. Seeing, or fancying, that I was suspected of an intention\r\nof carrying poison to him, I asked to be searched before I sat down\r\nat his bedside, and told the officer who was always there, that I was\r\nwilling to do anything that would assure him of the singleness of my\r\ndesigns. Nobody was hard with him or with me. There was duty to be\r\ndone, and it was done, but not harshly. The officer always gave me the\r\nassurance that he was worse, and some other sick prisoners in the\r\nroom, and some other prisoners who attended on them as sick nurses,\r\n(malefactors, but not incapable of kindness, God be thanked!) always\r\njoined in the same report.\r\n\r\nAs the days went on, I noticed more and more that he would lie placidly\r\nlooking at the white ceiling, with an absence of light in his face\r\nuntil some word of mine brightened it for an instant, and then it would\r\nsubside again. Sometimes he was almost or quite unable to speak, then\r\nhe would answer me with slight pressures on my hand, and I grew to\r\nunderstand his meaning very well.\r\n\r\nThe number of the days had risen to ten, when I saw a greater change\r\nin him than I had seen yet. His eyes were turned towards the door, and\r\nlighted up as I entered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear boy,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, as I sat down by his bed: \xe2\x80\x9cI thought you was late.\r\nBut I knowed you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is just the time,\xe2\x80\x9d said I. \xe2\x80\x9cI waited for it at the gate.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou always waits at the gate; don\xe2\x80\x99t you, dear boy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes. Not to lose a moment of the time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank\xe2\x80\x99ee dear boy, thank\xe2\x80\x99ee. God bless you! You\xe2\x80\x99ve never deserted me,\r\ndear boy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI pressed his hand in silence, for I could not forget that I had once\r\nmeant to desert him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what\xe2\x80\x99s the best of all,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99ve been more comfortable\r\nalonger me, since I was under a dark cloud, than when the sun shone.\r\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s best of all.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe lay on his back, breathing with great difficulty. Do what he would,\r\nand love me though he did, the light left his face ever and again, and a\r\nfilm came over the placid look at the white ceiling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAre you in much pain to-day?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t complain of none, dear boy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou never do complain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe had spoken his last words. He smiled, and I understood his touch to\r\nmean that he wished to lift my hand, and lay it on his breast. I laid it\r\nthere, and he smiled again, and put both his hands upon it.\r\n\r\nThe allotted time ran out, while we were thus; but, looking round, I\r\nfound the governor of the prison standing near me, and he whispered,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou needn\xe2\x80\x99t go yet.\xe2\x80\x9d I thanked him gratefully, and asked, \xe2\x80\x9cMight I\r\nspeak to him, if he can hear me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe governor stepped aside, and beckoned the officer away. The change,\r\nthough it was made without noise, drew back the film from the placid\r\nlook at the white ceiling, and he looked most affectionately at me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear Magwitch, I must tell you now, at last. You understand what I\r\nsay?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA gentle pressure on my hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou had a child once, whom you loved and lost.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA stronger pressure on my hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe lived, and found powerful friends. She is living now. She is a lady\r\nand very beautiful. And I love her!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith a last faint effort, which would have been powerless but for my\r\nyielding to it and assisting it, he raised my hand to his lips. Then,\r\nhe gently let it sink upon his breast again, with his own hands lying on\r\nit. The placid look at the white ceiling came back, and passed away, and\r\nhis head dropped quietly on his breast.\r\n\r\nMindful, then, of what we had read together, I thought of the two men\r\nwho went up into the Temple to pray, and I knew there were no better\r\nwords that I could say beside his bed, than \xe2\x80\x9cO Lord, be merciful to him\r\na sinner!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter LVII\r\n\r\nNow that I was left wholly to myself, I gave notice of my intention\r\nto quit the chambers in the Temple as soon as my tenancy could legally\r\ndetermine, and in the meanwhile to underlet them. At once I put bills\r\nup in the windows; for, I was in debt, and had scarcely any money, and\r\nbegan to be seriously alarmed by the state of my affairs. I ought\r\nrather to write that I should have been alarmed if I had had energy and\r\nconcentration enough to help me to the clear perception of any truth\r\nbeyond the fact that I was falling very ill. The late stress upon me had\r\nenabled me to put off illness, but not to put it away; I knew that it\r\nwas coming on me now, and I knew very little else, and was even careless\r\nas to that.\r\n\r\nFor a day or two, I lay on the sofa, or on the floor,--anywhere,\r\naccording as I happened to sink down,--with a heavy head and aching\r\nlimbs, and no purpose, and no power. Then there came, one night which\r\nappeared of great duration, and which teemed with anxiety and horror;\r\nand when in the morning I tried to sit up in my bed and think of it, I\r\nfound I could not do so.\r\n\r\nWhether I really had been down in Garden Court in the dead of the night,\r\ngroping about for the boat that I supposed to be there; whether I had\r\ntwo or three times come to myself on the staircase with great terror,\r\nnot knowing how I had got out of bed; whether I had found myself\r\nlighting the lamp, possessed by the idea that he was coming up\r\nthe stairs, and that the lights were blown out; whether I had been\r\ninexpressibly harassed by the distracted talking, laughing, and groaning\r\nof some one, and had half suspected those sounds to be of my own making;\r\nwhether there had been a closed iron furnace in a dark corner of\r\nthe room, and a voice had called out, over and over again, that Miss\r\nHavisham was consuming within it,--these were things that I tried to\r\nsettle with myself and get into some order, as I lay that morning on\r\nmy bed. But the vapor of a limekiln would come between me and them,\r\ndisordering them all, and it was through the vapor at last that I saw\r\ntwo men looking at me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you want?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked, starting; \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d returned one of them, bending down and touching me on the\r\nshoulder, \xe2\x80\x9cthis is a matter that you\xe2\x80\x99ll soon arrange, I dare say, but\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99re arrested.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is the debt?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHundred and twenty-three pound, fifteen, six. Jeweller\xe2\x80\x99s account, I\r\nthink.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is to be done?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou had better come to my house,\xe2\x80\x9d said the man. \xe2\x80\x9cI keep a very nice\r\nhouse.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI made some attempt to get up and dress myself. When I next attended\r\nto them, they were standing a little off from the bed, looking at me. I\r\nstill lay there.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou see my state,\xe2\x80\x9d said I. \xe2\x80\x9cI would come with you if I could; but\r\nindeed I am quite unable. If you take me from here, I think I shall die\r\nby the way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nPerhaps they replied, or argued the point, or tried to encourage me to\r\nbelieve that I was better than I thought. Forasmuch as they hang in\r\nmy memory by only this one slender thread, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what they did,\r\nexcept that they forbore to remove me.\r\n\r\nThat I had a fever and was avoided, that I suffered greatly, that\r\nI often lost my reason, that the time seemed interminable, that I\r\nconfounded impossible existences with my own identity; that I was a\r\nbrick in the house-wall, and yet entreating to be released from the\r\ngiddy place where the builders had set me; that I was a steel beam of a\r\nvast engine, clashing and whirling over a gulf, and yet that I implored\r\nin my own person to have the engine stopped, and my part in it hammered\r\noff; that I passed through these phases of disease, I know of my own\r\nremembrance, and did in some sort know at the time. That I sometimes\r\nstruggled with real people, in the belief that they were murderers, and\r\nthat I would all at once comprehend that they meant to do me good, and\r\nwould then sink exhausted in their arms, and suffer them to lay me\r\ndown, I also knew at the time. But, above all, I knew that there was a\r\nconstant tendency in all these people,--who, when I was very ill, would\r\npresent all kinds of extraordinary transformations of the human face,\r\nand would be much dilated in size,--above all, I say, I knew that there\r\nwas an extraordinary tendency in all these people, sooner or later, to\r\nsettle down into the likeness of Joe.\r\n\r\nAfter I had turned the worst point of my illness, I began to notice that\r\nwhile all its other features changed, this one consistent feature did\r\nnot change. Whoever came about me, still settled down into Joe. I opened\r\nmy eyes in the night, and I saw, in the great chair at the bedside, Joe.\r\nI opened my eyes in the day, and, sitting on the window-seat, smoking\r\nhis pipe in the shaded open window, still I saw Joe. I asked for cooling\r\ndrink, and the dear hand that gave it me was Joe\xe2\x80\x99s. I sank back on\r\nmy pillow after drinking, and the face that looked so hopefully and\r\ntenderly upon me was the face of Joe.\r\n\r\nAt last, one day, I took courage, and said, \xe2\x80\x9cIs it Joe?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAnd the dear old home-voice answered, \xe2\x80\x9cWhich it air, old chap.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO Joe, you break my heart! Look angry at me, Joe. Strike me, Joe. Tell\r\nme of my ingratitude. Don\xe2\x80\x99t be so good to me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nFor Joe had actually laid his head down on the pillow at my side, and\r\nput his arm round my neck, in his joy that I knew him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhich dear old Pip, old chap,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe, \xe2\x80\x9cyou and me was ever friends.\r\nAnd when you\xe2\x80\x99re well enough to go out for a ride--what larks!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAfter which, Joe withdrew to the window, and stood with his back towards\r\nme, wiping his eyes. And as my extreme weakness prevented me from\r\ngetting up and going to him, I lay there, penitently whispering, \xe2\x80\x9cO God\r\nbless him! O God bless this gentle Christian man!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJoe\xe2\x80\x99s eyes were red when I next found him beside me; but I was holding\r\nhis hand, and we both felt happy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow long, dear Joe?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhich you meantersay, Pip, how long have your illness lasted, dear old\r\nchap?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Joe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s the end of May, Pip. To-morrow is the first of June.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd have you been here all that time, dear Joe?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPretty nigh, old chap. For, as I says to Biddy when the news of your\r\nbeing ill were brought by letter, which it were brought by the post, and\r\nbeing formerly single he is now married though underpaid for a deal of\r\nwalking and shoe-leather, but wealth were not a object on his part, and\r\nmarriage were the great wish of his hart--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is so delightful to hear you, Joe! But I interrupt you in what you\r\nsaid to Biddy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhich it were,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe, \xe2\x80\x9cthat how you might be amongst strangers, and\r\nthat how you and me having been ever friends, a wisit at such a moment\r\nmight not prove unacceptabobble. And Biddy, her word were, \xe2\x80\x98Go to him,\r\nwithout loss of time.\xe2\x80\x99 That,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe, summing up with his judicial\r\nair, \xe2\x80\x9cwere the word of Biddy. \xe2\x80\x98Go to him,\xe2\x80\x99 Biddy say, \xe2\x80\x98without loss of\r\ntime.\xe2\x80\x99 In short, I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t greatly deceive you,\xe2\x80\x9d Joe added, after a\r\nlittle grave reflection, \xe2\x80\x9cif I represented to you that the word of that\r\nyoung woman were, \xe2\x80\x98without a minute\xe2\x80\x99s loss of time.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThere Joe cut himself short, and informed me that I was to be talked\r\nto in great moderation, and that I was to take a little nourishment at\r\nstated frequent times, whether I felt inclined for it or not, and that\r\nI was to submit myself to all his orders. So I kissed his hand, and lay\r\nquiet, while he proceeded to indite a note to Biddy, with my love in it.\r\n\r\nEvidently Biddy had taught Joe to write. As I lay in bed looking at him,\r\nit made me, in my weak state, cry again with pleasure to see the\r\npride with which he set about his letter. My bedstead, divested of its\r\ncurtains, had been removed, with me upon it, into the sitting-room, as\r\nthe airiest and largest, and the carpet had been taken away, and\r\nthe room kept always fresh and wholesome night and day. At my own\r\nwriting-table, pushed into a corner and cumbered with little bottles,\r\nJoe now sat down to his great work, first choosing a pen from the\r\npen-tray as if it were a chest of large tools, and tucking up his\r\nsleeves as if he were going to wield a crow-bar or sledgehammer. It was\r\nnecessary for Joe to hold on heavily to the table with his left elbow,\r\nand to get his right leg well out behind him, before he could begin; and\r\nwhen he did begin he made every downstroke so slowly that it might\r\nhave been six feet long, while at every upstroke I could hear his pen\r\nspluttering extensively. He had a curious idea that the inkstand was\r\non the side of him where it was not, and constantly dipped his pen into\r\nspace, and seemed quite satisfied with the result. Occasionally, he was\r\ntripped up by some orthographical stumbling-block; but on the whole\r\nhe got on very well indeed; and when he had signed his name, and had\r\nremoved a finishing blot from the paper to the crown of his head with\r\nhis two forefingers, he got up and hovered about the table, trying the\r\neffect of his performance from various points of view, as it lay there,\r\nwith unbounded satisfaction.\r\n\r\nNot to make Joe uneasy by talking too much, even if I had been able to\r\ntalk much, I deferred asking him about Miss Havisham until next day. He\r\nshook his head when I then asked him if she had recovered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs she dead, Joe?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy you see, old chap,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe, in a tone of remonstrance, and by way\r\nof getting at it by degrees, \xe2\x80\x9cI wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t go so far as to say that, for\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s a deal to say; but she ain\xe2\x80\x99t--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLiving, Joe?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s nigher where it is,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe; \xe2\x80\x9cshe ain\xe2\x80\x99t living.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid she linger long, Joe?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cArter you was took ill, pretty much about what you might call (if you\r\nwas put to it) a week,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe; still determined, on my account, to\r\ncome at everything by degrees.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear Joe, have you heard what becomes of her property?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, old chap,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe, \xe2\x80\x9cit do appear that she had settled the most\r\nof it, which I meantersay tied it up, on Miss Estella. But she had\r\nwrote out a little coddleshell in her own hand a day or two afore the\r\naccident, leaving a cool four thousand to Mr. Matthew Pocket. And why,\r\ndo you suppose, above all things, Pip, she left that cool four thousand\r\nunto him? \xe2\x80\x98Because of Pip\xe2\x80\x99s account of him, the said Matthew.\xe2\x80\x99 I am told\r\nby Biddy, that air the writing,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe, repeating the legal turn as\r\nif it did him infinite good, \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98account of him the said Matthew.\xe2\x80\x99 And a\r\ncool four thousand, Pip!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI never discovered from whom Joe derived the conventional temperature of\r\nthe four thousand pounds; but it appeared to make the sum of money more\r\nto him, and he had a manifest relish in insisting on its being cool.\r\n\r\nThis account gave me great joy, as it perfected the only good thing I\r\nhad done. I asked Joe whether he had heard if any of the other relations\r\nhad any legacies?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMiss Sarah,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe, \xe2\x80\x9cshe have twenty-five pound perannium fur to\r\nbuy pills, on account of being bilious. Miss Georgiana, she have twenty\r\npound down. Mrs.--what\xe2\x80\x99s the name of them wild beasts with humps, old\r\nchap?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cCamels?\xe2\x80\x9d said I, wondering why he could possibly want to know.\r\n\r\nJoe nodded. \xe2\x80\x9cMrs. Camels,\xe2\x80\x9d by which I presently understood he meant\r\nCamilla, \xe2\x80\x9cshe have five pound fur to buy rushlights to put her in\r\nspirits when she wake up in the night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe accuracy of these recitals was sufficiently obvious to me, to give\r\nme great confidence in Joe\xe2\x80\x99s information. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd now,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe, \xe2\x80\x9cyou\r\nain\xe2\x80\x99t that strong yet, old chap, that you can take in more nor one\r\nadditional shovelful to-day. Old Orlick he\xe2\x80\x99s been a bustin\xe2\x80\x99 open a\r\ndwelling-ouse.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhose?\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot, I grant you, but what his manners is given to blusterous,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nJoe, apologetically; \xe2\x80\x9cstill, a Englishman\xe2\x80\x99s ouse is his Castle, and\r\ncastles must not be busted \xe2\x80\x98cept when done in war time. And wotsume\xe2\x80\x99er\r\nthe failings on his part, he were a corn and seedsman in his hart.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it Pumblechook\xe2\x80\x99s house that has been broken into, then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s it, Pip,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe; \xe2\x80\x9cand they took his till, and they took his\r\ncash-box, and they drinked his wine, and they partook of his wittles,\r\nand they slapped his face, and they pulled his nose, and they tied him\r\nup to his bedpust, and they giv\xe2\x80\x99 him a dozen, and they stuffed his\r\nmouth full of flowering annuals to prewent his crying out. But he knowed\r\nOrlick, and Orlick\xe2\x80\x99s in the county jail.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBy these approaches we arrived at unrestricted conversation. I was slow\r\nto gain strength, but I did slowly and surely become less weak, and Joe\r\nstayed with me, and I fancied I was little Pip again.\r\n\r\nFor the tenderness of Joe was so beautifully proportioned to my need,\r\nthat I was like a child in his hands. He would sit and talk to me in the\r\nold confidence, and with the old simplicity, and in the old unassertive\r\nprotecting way, so that I would half believe that all my life since the\r\ndays of the old kitchen was one of the mental troubles of the fever that\r\nwas gone. He did everything for me except the household work, for which\r\nhe had engaged a very decent woman, after paying off the laundress on\r\nhis first arrival. \xe2\x80\x9cWhich I do assure you, Pip,\xe2\x80\x9d he would often say, in\r\nexplanation of that liberty; \xe2\x80\x9cI found her a tapping the spare bed, like\r\na cask of beer, and drawing off the feathers in a bucket, for sale.\r\nWhich she would have tapped yourn next, and draw\xe2\x80\x99d it off with you a\r\nlaying on it, and was then a carrying away the coals gradiwally in\r\nthe soup-tureen and wegetable-dishes, and the wine and spirits in your\r\nWellington boots.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWe looked forward to the day when I should go out for a ride, as we had\r\nonce looked forward to the day of my apprenticeship. And when the day\r\ncame, and an open carriage was got into the Lane, Joe wrapped me up,\r\ntook me in his arms, carried me down to it, and put me in, as if I were\r\nstill the small helpless creature to whom he had so abundantly given of\r\nthe wealth of his great nature.\r\n\r\nAnd Joe got in beside me, and we drove away together into the country,\r\nwhere the rich summer growth was already on the trees and on the grass,\r\nand sweet summer scents filled all the air. The day happened to be\r\nSunday, and when I looked on the loveliness around me, and thought\r\nhow it had grown and changed, and how the little wild-flowers had been\r\nforming, and the voices of the birds had been strengthening, by day and\r\nby night, under the sun and under the stars, while poor I lay burning\r\nand tossing on my bed, the mere remembrance of having burned and tossed\r\nthere came like a check upon my peace. But when I heard the Sunday\r\nbells, and looked around a little more upon the outspread beauty, I felt\r\nthat I was not nearly thankful enough,--that I was too weak yet to be\r\neven that,--and I laid my head on Joe\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder, as I had laid it long\r\nago when he had taken me to the Fair or where not, and it was too much\r\nfor my young senses.\r\n\r\nMore composure came to me after a while, and we talked as we used\r\nto talk, lying on the grass at the old Battery. There was no change\r\nwhatever in Joe. Exactly what he had been in my eyes then, he was in my\r\neyes still; just as simply faithful, and as simply right.\r\n\r\nWhen we got back again, and he lifted me out, and carried me--so\r\neasily!--across the court and up the stairs, I thought of that eventful\r\nChristmas Day when he had carried me over the marshes. We had not yet\r\nmade any allusion to my change of fortune, nor did I know how much of\r\nmy late history he was acquainted with. I was so doubtful of myself now,\r\nand put so much trust in him, that I could not satisfy myself whether I\r\nought to refer to it when he did not.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you heard, Joe,\xe2\x80\x9d I asked him that evening, upon further\r\nconsideration, as he smoked his pipe at the window, \xe2\x80\x9cwho my patron was?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI heerd,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Joe, \xe2\x80\x9cas it were not Miss Havisham, old chap.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you hear who it was, Joe?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell! I heerd as it were a person what sent the person what giv\xe2\x80\x99 you\r\nthe bank-notes at the Jolly Bargemen, Pip.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo it was.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAstonishing!\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe, in the placidest way.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you hear that he was dead, Joe?\xe2\x80\x9d I presently asked, with increasing\r\ndiffidence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhich? Him as sent the bank-notes, Pip?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe, after meditating a long time, and looking rather\r\nevasively at the window-seat, \xe2\x80\x9cas I did hear tell that how he were\r\nsomething or another in a general way in that direction.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDid you hear anything of his circumstances, Joe?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot partickler, Pip.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you would like to hear, Joe--\xe2\x80\x9d I was beginning, when Joe got up and\r\ncame to my sofa.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLookee here, old chap,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe, bending over me. \xe2\x80\x9cEver the best of\r\nfriends; ain\xe2\x80\x99t us, Pip?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI was ashamed to answer him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWery good, then,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe, as if I had answered; \xe2\x80\x9cthat\xe2\x80\x99s all right;\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s agreed upon. Then why go into subjects, old chap, which as\r\nbetwixt two sech must be for ever onnecessary? There\xe2\x80\x99s subjects enough\r\nas betwixt two sech, without onnecessary ones. Lord! To think of your\r\npoor sister and her Rampages! And don\xe2\x80\x99t you remember Tickler?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI do indeed, Joe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLookee here, old chap,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe. \xe2\x80\x9cI done what I could to keep you\r\nand Tickler in sunders, but my power were not always fully equal to my\r\ninclinations. For when your poor sister had a mind to drop into you, it\r\nwere not so much,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe, in his favorite argumentative way, \xe2\x80\x9cthat\r\nshe dropped into me too, if I put myself in opposition to her, but that\r\nshe dropped into you always heavier for it. I noticed that. It ain\xe2\x80\x99t a\r\ngrab at a man\xe2\x80\x99s whisker, not yet a shake or two of a man (to which your\r\nsister was quite welcome), that \xe2\x80\x98ud put a man off from getting a little\r\nchild out of punishment. But when that little child is dropped into\r\nheavier for that grab of whisker or shaking, then that man naterally up\r\nand says to himself, \xe2\x80\x98Where is the good as you are a doing? I grant you\r\nI see the \xe2\x80\x98arm,\xe2\x80\x99 says the man, \xe2\x80\x98but I don\xe2\x80\x99t see the good. I call upon\r\nyou, sir, therefore, to pint out the good.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe man says?\xe2\x80\x9d I observed, as Joe waited for me to speak.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe man says,\xe2\x80\x9d Joe assented. \xe2\x80\x9cIs he right, that man?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear Joe, he is always right.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWell, old chap,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe, \xe2\x80\x9cthen abide by your words. If he\xe2\x80\x99s always\r\nright (which in general he\xe2\x80\x99s more likely wrong), he\xe2\x80\x99s right when he says\r\nthis: Supposing ever you kep any little matter to yourself, when you\r\nwas a little child, you kep it mostly because you know\xe2\x80\x99d as J. Gargery\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npower to part you and Tickler in sunders were not fully equal to his\r\ninclinations. Theerfore, think no more of it as betwixt two sech, and do\r\nnot let us pass remarks upon onnecessary subjects. Biddy giv\xe2\x80\x99 herself a\r\ndeal o\xe2\x80\x99 trouble with me afore I left (for I am almost awful dull), as I\r\nshould view it in this light, and, viewing it in this light, as I should\r\nso put it. Both of which,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe, quite charmed with his logical\r\narrangement, \xe2\x80\x9cbeing done, now this to you a true friend, say. Namely.\r\nYou mustn\xe2\x80\x99t go a overdoing on it, but you must have your supper and your\r\nwine and water, and you must be put betwixt the sheets.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe delicacy with which Joe dismissed this theme, and the sweet tact and\r\nkindness with which Biddy--who with her woman\xe2\x80\x99s wit had found me out so\r\nsoon--had prepared him for it, made a deep impression on my mind. But\r\nwhether Joe knew how poor I was, and how my great expectations had\r\nall dissolved, like our own marsh mists before the sun, I could not\r\nunderstand.\r\n\r\nAnother thing in Joe that I could not understand when it first began to\r\ndevelop itself, but which I soon arrived at a sorrowful comprehension\r\nof, was this: As I became stronger and better, Joe became a little less\r\neasy with me. In my weakness and entire dependence on him, the dear\r\nfellow had fallen into the old tone, and called me by the old names,\r\nthe dear \xe2\x80\x9cold Pip, old chap,\xe2\x80\x9d that now were music in my ears. I too had\r\nfallen into the old ways, only happy and thankful that he let me. But,\r\nimperceptibly, though I held by them fast, Joe\xe2\x80\x99s hold upon them began\r\nto slacken; and whereas I wondered at this, at first, I soon began to\r\nunderstand that the cause of it was in me, and that the fault of it was\r\nall mine.\r\n\r\nAh! Had I given Joe no reason to doubt my constancy, and to think that\r\nin prosperity I should grow cold to him and cast him off? Had I given\r\nJoe\xe2\x80\x99s innocent heart no cause to feel instinctively that as I got\r\nstronger, his hold upon me would be weaker, and that he had better\r\nloosen it in time and let me go, before I plucked myself away?\r\n\r\nIt was on the third or fourth occasion of my going out walking in the\r\nTemple Gardens leaning on Joe\xe2\x80\x99s arm, that I saw this change in him very\r\nplainly. We had been sitting in the bright warm sunlight, looking at the\r\nriver, and I chanced to say as we got up,--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSee, Joe! I can walk quite strongly. Now, you shall see me walk back by\r\nmyself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhich do not overdo it, Pip,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I shall be happy fur to\r\nsee you able, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe last word grated on me; but how could I remonstrate! I walked no\r\nfurther than the gate of the gardens, and then pretended to be\r\nweaker than I was, and asked Joe for his arm. Joe gave it me, but was\r\nthoughtful.\r\n\r\nI, for my part, was thoughtful too; for, how best to check this growing\r\nchange in Joe was a great perplexity to my remorseful thoughts. That I\r\nwas ashamed to tell him exactly how I was placed, and what I had come\r\ndown to, I do not seek to conceal; but I hope my reluctance was not\r\nquite an unworthy one. He would want to help me out of his little\r\nsavings, I knew, and I knew that he ought not to help me, and that I\r\nmust not suffer him to do it.\r\n\r\nIt was a thoughtful evening with both of us. But, before we went to\r\nbed, I had resolved that I would wait over to-morrow,--to-morrow being\r\nSunday,--and would begin my new course with the new week. On Monday\r\nmorning I would speak to Joe about this change, I would lay aside this\r\nlast vestige of reserve, I would tell him what I had in my thoughts\r\n(that Secondly, not yet arrived at), and why I had not decided to go\r\nout to Herbert, and then the change would be conquered for ever. As I\r\ncleared, Joe cleared, and it seemed as though he had sympathetically\r\narrived at a resolution too.\r\n\r\nWe had a quiet day on the Sunday, and we rode out into the country, and\r\nthen walked in the fields.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI feel thankful that I have been ill, Joe,\xe2\x80\x9d I said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear old Pip, old chap, you\xe2\x80\x99re a\xe2\x80\x99most come round, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt has been a memorable time for me, Joe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLikeways for myself, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d Joe returned.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe have had a time together, Joe, that I can never forget. There were\r\ndays once, I know, that I did for a while forget; but I never shall\r\nforget these.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPip,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe, appearing a little hurried and troubled, \xe2\x80\x9cthere has\r\nbeen larks. And, dear sir, what have been betwixt us--have been.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAt night, when I had gone to bed, Joe came into my room, as he had done\r\nall through my recovery. He asked me if I felt sure that I was as well\r\nas in the morning?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, dear Joe, quite.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd are always a getting stronger, old chap?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, dear Joe, steadily.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJoe patted the coverlet on my shoulder with his great good hand, and\r\nsaid, in what I thought a husky voice, \xe2\x80\x9cGood night!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWhen I got up in the morning, refreshed and stronger yet, I was full of\r\nmy resolution to tell Joe all, without delay. I would tell him before\r\nbreakfast. I would dress at once and go to his room and surprise him;\r\nfor, it was the first day I had been up early. I went to his room, and\r\nhe was not there. Not only was he not there, but his box was gone.\r\n\r\nI hurried then to the breakfast-table, and on it found a letter. These\r\nwere its brief contents:--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNot wishful to intrude I have departured fur you are well again dear\r\nPip and will do better without JO.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cP.S. Ever the best of friends.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nEnclosed in the letter was a receipt for the debt and costs on which I\r\nhad been arrested. Down to that moment, I had vainly supposed that my\r\ncreditor had withdrawn, or suspended proceedings until I should be quite\r\nrecovered. I had never dreamed of Joe\xe2\x80\x99s having paid the money; but Joe\r\nhad paid it, and the receipt was in his name.\r\n\r\nWhat remained for me now, but to follow him to the dear old forge, and\r\nthere to have out my disclosure to him, and my penitent remonstrance\r\nwith him, and there to relieve my mind and heart of that reserved\r\nSecondly, which had begun as a vague something lingering in my thoughts,\r\nand had formed into a settled purpose?\r\n\r\nThe purpose was, that I would go to Biddy, that I would show her how\r\nhumbled and repentant I came back, that I would tell her how I had lost\r\nall I once hoped for, that I would remind her of our old confidences in\r\nmy first unhappy time. Then I would say to her, \xe2\x80\x9cBiddy, I think you once\r\nliked me very well, when my errant heart, even while it strayed away\r\nfrom you, was quieter and better with you than it ever has been since.\r\nIf you can like me only half as well once more, if you can take me with\r\nall my faults and disappointments on my head, if you can receive me like\r\na forgiven child (and indeed I am as sorry, Biddy, and have as much need\r\nof a hushing voice and a soothing hand), I hope I am a little worthier\r\nof you that I was,--not much, but a little. And, Biddy, it shall rest\r\nwith you to say whether I shall work at the forge with Joe, or whether I\r\nshall try for any different occupation down in this country, or whether\r\nwe shall go away to a distant place where an opportunity awaits me which\r\nI set aside, when it was offered, until I knew your answer. And now,\r\ndear Biddy, if you can tell me that you will go through the world with\r\nme, you will surely make it a better world for me, and me a better man\r\nfor it, and I will try hard to make it a better world for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nSuch was my purpose. After three days more of recovery, I went down to\r\nthe old place to put it in execution. And how I sped in it is all I have\r\nleft to tell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter LVIII\r\n\r\nThe tidings of my high fortunes having had a heavy fall had got down\r\nto my native place and its neighborhood before I got there. I found the\r\nBlue Boar in possession of the intelligence, and I found that it made a\r\ngreat change in the Boar\xe2\x80\x99s demeanour. Whereas the Boar had cultivated\r\nmy good opinion with warm assiduity when I was coming into property,\r\nthe Boar was exceedingly cool on the subject now that I was going out of\r\nproperty.\r\n\r\nIt was evening when I arrived, much fatigued by the journey I had so\r\noften made so easily. The Boar could not put me into my usual bedroom,\r\nwhich was engaged (probably by some one who had expectations), and\r\ncould only assign me a very indifferent chamber among the pigeons and\r\npost-chaises up the yard. But I had as sound a sleep in that lodging as\r\nin the most superior accommodation the Boar could have given me, and the\r\nquality of my dreams was about the same as in the best bedroom.\r\n\r\nEarly in the morning, while my breakfast was getting ready, I strolled\r\nround by Satis House. There were printed bills on the gate and on bits\r\nof carpet hanging out of the windows, announcing a sale by auction of\r\nthe Household Furniture and Effects, next week. The House itself was to\r\nbe sold as old building materials, and pulled down. LOT 1 was marked in\r\nwhitewashed knock-knee letters on the brew house; LOT 2 on that part of\r\nthe main building which had been so long shut up. Other lots were marked\r\noff on other parts of the structure, and the ivy had been torn down to\r\nmake room for the inscriptions, and much of it trailed low in the dust\r\nand was withered already. Stepping in for a moment at the open gate, and\r\nlooking around me with the uncomfortable air of a stranger who had no\r\nbusiness there, I saw the auctioneer\xe2\x80\x99s clerk walking on the casks and\r\ntelling them off for the information of a catalogue-compiler, pen in\r\nhand, who made a temporary desk of the wheeled chair I had so often\r\npushed along to the tune of Old Clem.\r\n\r\nWhen I got back to my breakfast in the Boar\xe2\x80\x99s coffee-room, I found Mr.\r\nPumblechook conversing with the landlord. Mr. Pumblechook (not improved\r\nin appearance by his late nocturnal adventure) was waiting for me, and\r\naddressed me in the following terms:--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYoung man, I am sorry to see you brought low. But what else could be\r\nexpected! what else could be expected!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nAs he extended his hand with a magnificently forgiving air, and as I was\r\nbroken by illness and unfit to quarrel, I took it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWilliam,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Pumblechook to the waiter, \xe2\x80\x9cput a muffin on table.\r\nAnd has it come to this! Has it come to this!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI frowningly sat down to my breakfast. Mr. Pumblechook stood over me and\r\npoured out my tea--before I could touch the teapot--with the air of a\r\nbenefactor who was resolved to be true to the last.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWilliam,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Pumblechook, mournfully, \xe2\x80\x9cput the salt on. In\r\nhappier times,\xe2\x80\x9d addressing me, \xe2\x80\x9cI think you took sugar? And did you take\r\nmilk? You did. Sugar and milk. William, bring a watercress.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThank you,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, shortly, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I don\xe2\x80\x99t eat watercresses.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t eat \xe2\x80\x98em,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Mr. Pumblechook, sighing and nodding\r\nhis head several times, as if he might have expected that, and as if\r\nabstinence from watercresses were consistent with my downfall. \xe2\x80\x9cTrue.\r\nThe simple fruits of the earth. No. You needn\xe2\x80\x99t bring any, William.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI went on with my breakfast, and Mr. Pumblechook continued to stand over\r\nme, staring fishily and breathing noisily, as he always did.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cLittle more than skin and bone!\xe2\x80\x9d mused Mr. Pumblechook, aloud. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd yet\r\nwhen he went from here (I may say with my blessing), and I spread afore\r\nhim my humble store, like the Bee, he was as plump as a Peach!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThis reminded me of the wonderful difference between the servile manner\r\nin which he had offered his hand in my new prosperity, saying, \xe2\x80\x9cMay I?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n and the ostentatious clemency with which he had just now exhibited the\r\nsame fat five fingers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHah!\xe2\x80\x9d he went on, handing me the bread and butter. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd air you a going\r\nto Joseph?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn heaven\xe2\x80\x99s name,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, firing in spite of myself, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat does it\r\nmatter to you where I am going? Leave that teapot alone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt was the worst course I could have taken, because it gave Pumblechook\r\nthe opportunity he wanted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, young man,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, releasing the handle of the article in\r\nquestion, retiring a step or two from my table, and speaking for the\r\nbehoof of the landlord and waiter at the door, \xe2\x80\x9cI will leave that teapot\r\nalone. You are right, young man. For once you are right. I forgit myself\r\nwhen I take such an interest in your breakfast, as to wish your frame,\r\nexhausted by the debilitating effects of prodigygality, to be stimilated\r\nby the \xe2\x80\x98olesome nourishment of your forefathers. And yet,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\nPumblechook, turning to the landlord and waiter, and pointing me out at\r\narm\xe2\x80\x99s length, \xe2\x80\x9cthis is him as I ever sported with in his days of happy\r\ninfancy! Tell me not it cannot be; I tell you this is him!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nA low murmur from the two replied. The waiter appeared to be\r\nparticularly affected.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is him,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pumblechook, \xe2\x80\x9cas I have rode in my shay-cart. This\r\nis him as I have seen brought up by hand. This is him untoe the sister\r\nof which I was uncle by marriage, as her name was Georgiana M\xe2\x80\x99ria from\r\nher own mother, let him deny it if he can!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe waiter seemed convinced that I could not deny it, and that it gave\r\nthe case a black look.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYoung man,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pumblechook, screwing his head at me in the old\r\nfashion, \xe2\x80\x9cyou air a going to Joseph. What does it matter to me, you\r\nask me, where you air a going? I say to you, Sir, you air a going to\r\nJoseph.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe waiter coughed, as if he modestly invited me to get over that.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pumblechook, and all this with a most exasperating air\r\nof saying in the cause of virtue what was perfectly convincing and\r\nconclusive, \xe2\x80\x9cI will tell you what to say to Joseph. Here is Squires of\r\nthe Boar present, known and respected in this town, and here is William,\r\nwhich his father\xe2\x80\x99s name was Potkins if I do not deceive myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou do not, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said William.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn their presence,\xe2\x80\x9d pursued Pumblechook, \xe2\x80\x9cI will tell you, young\r\nman, what to say to Joseph. Says you, \xe2\x80\x9cJoseph, I have this day seen\r\nmy earliest benefactor and the founder of my fortun\xe2\x80\x99s. I will name no\r\nnames, Joseph, but so they are pleased to call him up town, and I have\r\nseen that man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI swear I don\xe2\x80\x99t see him here,\xe2\x80\x9d said I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSay that likewise,\xe2\x80\x9d retorted Pumblechook. \xe2\x80\x9cSay you said that, and even\r\nJoseph will probably betray surprise.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere you quite mistake him,\xe2\x80\x9d said I. \xe2\x80\x9cI know better.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSays you,\xe2\x80\x9d Pumblechook went on, \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Joseph, I have seen that man, and\r\nthat man bears you no malice and bears me no malice. He knows your\r\ncharacter, Joseph, and is well acquainted with your pig-headedness and\r\nignorance; and he knows my character, Joseph, and he knows my want of\r\ngratitoode. Yes, Joseph,\xe2\x80\x99 says you,\xe2\x80\x9d here Pumblechook shook his head and\r\nhand at me, \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98he knows my total deficiency of common human gratitoode.\r\nHe knows it, Joseph, as none can. You do not know it, Joseph, having no\r\ncall to know it, but that man do.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWindy donkey as he was, it really amazed me that he could have the face\r\nto talk thus to mine.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSays you, \xe2\x80\x98Joseph, he gave me a little message, which I will now\r\nrepeat. It was that, in my being brought low, he saw the finger of\r\nProvidence. He knowed that finger when he saw Joseph, and he saw it\r\nplain. It pinted out this writing, Joseph. Reward of ingratitoode to his\r\nearliest benefactor, and founder of fortun\xe2\x80\x99s. But that man said he did\r\nnot repent of what he had done, Joseph. Not at all. It was right to do\r\nit, it was kind to do it, it was benevolent to do it, and he would do it\r\nagain.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s pity,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, scornfully, as I finished my interrupted breakfast,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cthat the man did not say what he had done and would do again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSquires of the Boar!\xe2\x80\x9d Pumblechook was now addressing the landlord, \xe2\x80\x9cand\r\nWilliam! I have no objections to your mentioning, either up town or down\r\ntown, if such should be your wishes, that it was right to do it, kind to\r\ndo it, benevolent to do it, and that I would do it again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nWith those words the Impostor shook them both by the hand, with an air,\r\nand left the house; leaving me much more astonished than delighted by\r\nthe virtues of that same indefinite \xe2\x80\x9cit.\xe2\x80\x9d I was not long after him in\r\nleaving the house too, and when I went down the High Street I saw him\r\nholding forth (no doubt to the same effect) at his shop door to a select\r\ngroup, who honored me with very unfavorable glances as I passed on the\r\nopposite side of the way.\r\n\r\nBut, it was only the pleasanter to turn to Biddy and to Joe, whose\r\ngreat forbearance shone more brightly than before, if that could be,\r\ncontrasted with this brazen pretender. I went towards them slowly, for\r\nmy limbs were weak, but with a sense of increasing relief as I drew\r\nnearer to them, and a sense of leaving arrogance and untruthfulness\r\nfurther and further behind.\r\n\r\nThe June weather was delicious. The sky was blue, the larks were soaring\r\nhigh over the green corn, I thought all that countryside more beautiful\r\nand peaceful by far than I had ever known it to be yet. Many pleasant\r\npictures of the life that I would lead there, and of the change for the\r\nbetter that would come over my character when I had a guiding spirit at\r\nmy side whose simple faith and clear home wisdom I had proved, beguiled\r\nmy way. They awakened a tender emotion in me; for my heart was softened\r\nby my return, and such a change had come to pass, that I felt like one\r\nwho was toiling home barefoot from distant travel, and whose wanderings\r\nhad lasted many years.\r\n\r\nThe schoolhouse where Biddy was mistress I had never seen; but, the\r\nlittle roundabout lane by which I entered the village, for quietness\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsake, took me past it. I was disappointed to find that the day was a\r\nholiday; no children were there, and Biddy\xe2\x80\x99s house was closed. Some\r\nhopeful notion of seeing her, busily engaged in her daily duties, before\r\nshe saw me, had been in my mind and was defeated.\r\n\r\nBut the forge was a very short distance off, and I went towards it under\r\nthe sweet green limes, listening for the clink of Joe\xe2\x80\x99s hammer. Long\r\nafter I ought to have heard it, and long after I had fancied I heard it\r\nand found it but a fancy, all was still. The limes were there, and the\r\nwhite thorns were there, and the chestnut-trees were there, and their\r\nleaves rustled harmoniously when I stopped to listen; but, the clink of\r\nJoe\xe2\x80\x99s hammer was not in the midsummer wind.\r\n\r\nAlmost fearing, without knowing why, to come in view of the forge, I saw\r\nit at last, and saw that it was closed. No gleam of fire, no glittering\r\nshower of sparks, no roar of bellows; all shut up, and still.\r\n\r\nBut the house was not deserted, and the best parlor seemed to be in use,\r\nfor there were white curtains fluttering in its window, and the window\r\nwas open and gay with flowers. I went softly towards it, meaning to peep\r\nover the flowers, when Joe and Biddy stood before me, arm in arm.\r\n\r\nAt first Biddy gave a cry, as if she thought it was my apparition, but\r\nin another moment she was in my embrace. I wept to see her, and she wept\r\nto see me; I, because she looked so fresh and pleasant; she, because I\r\nlooked so worn and white.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut dear Biddy, how smart you are!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, dear Pip.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd Joe, how smart you are!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, dear old Pip, old chap.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI looked at both of them, from one to the other, and then--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s my wedding-day!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Biddy, in a burst of happiness, \xe2\x80\x9cand I am\r\nmarried to Joe!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey had taken me into the kitchen, and I had laid my head down on\r\nthe old deal table. Biddy held one of my hands to her lips, and Joe\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nrestoring touch was on my shoulder. \xe2\x80\x9cWhich he warn\xe2\x80\x99t strong enough, my\r\ndear, fur to be surprised,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe. And Biddy said, \xe2\x80\x9cI ought to\r\nhave thought of it, dear Joe, but I was too happy.\xe2\x80\x9d They were both so\r\noverjoyed to see me, so proud to see me, so touched by my coming to\r\nthem, so delighted that I should have come by accident to make their day\r\ncomplete!\r\n\r\nMy first thought was one of great thankfulness that I had never breathed\r\nthis last baffled hope to Joe. How often, while he was with me in my\r\nillness, had it risen to my lips! How irrevocable would have been his\r\nknowledge of it, if he had remained with me but another hour!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear Biddy,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, \xe2\x80\x9cyou have the best husband in the whole world,\r\nand if you could have seen him by my bed you would have--But no, you\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t love him better than you do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t indeed,\xe2\x80\x9d said Biddy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd, dear Joe, you have the best wife in the whole world, and she will\r\nmake you as happy as even you deserve to be, you dear, good, noble Joe!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nJoe looked at me with a quivering lip, and fairly put his sleeve before\r\nhis eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd Joe and Biddy both, as you have been to church to-day, and are in\r\ncharity and love with all mankind, receive my humble thanks for all you\r\nhave done for me, and all I have so ill repaid! And when I say that I am\r\ngoing away within the hour, for I am soon going abroad, and that I shall\r\nnever rest until I have worked for the money with which you have kept me\r\nout of prison, and have sent it to you, don\xe2\x80\x99t think, dear Joe and Biddy,\r\nthat if I could repay it a thousand times over, I suppose I could cancel\r\na farthing of the debt I owe you, or that I would do so if I could!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThey were both melted by these words, and both entreated me to say no\r\nmore.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I must say more. Dear Joe, I hope you will have children to love,\r\nand that some little fellow will sit in this chimney-corner of a winter\r\nnight, who may remind you of another little fellow gone out of it for\r\never. Don\xe2\x80\x99t tell him, Joe, that I was thankless; don\xe2\x80\x99t tell him, Biddy,\r\nthat I was ungenerous and unjust; only tell him that I honored you both,\r\nbecause you were both so good and true, and that, as your child, I said\r\nit would be natural to him to grow up a much better man than I did.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI ain\xe2\x80\x99t a going,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe, from behind his sleeve, \xe2\x80\x9cto tell him\r\nnothink o\xe2\x80\x99 that natur, Pip. Nor Biddy ain\xe2\x80\x99t. Nor yet no one ain\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd now, though I know you have already done it in your own kind\r\nhearts, pray tell me, both, that you forgive me! Pray let me hear you\r\nsay the words, that I may carry the sound of them away with me, and then\r\nI shall be able to believe that you can trust me, and think better of\r\nme, in the time to come!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO dear old Pip, old chap,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe. \xe2\x80\x9cGod knows as I forgive you, if I\r\nhave anythink to forgive!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAmen! And God knows I do!\xe2\x80\x9d echoed Biddy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow let me go up and look at my old little room, and rest there a few\r\nminutes by myself. And then, when I have eaten and drunk with you, go\r\nwith me as far as the finger-post, dear Joe and Biddy, before we say\r\ngood-bye!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nI sold all I had, and put aside as much as I could, for a composition\r\nwith my creditors,--who gave me ample time to pay them in full,--and I\r\nwent out and joined Herbert. Within a month, I had quitted England,\r\nand within two months I was clerk to Clarriker and Co., and within four\r\nmonths I assumed my first undivided responsibility. For the beam across\r\nthe parlor ceiling at Mill Pond Bank had then ceased to tremble under\r\nold Bill Barley\xe2\x80\x99s growls and was at peace, and Herbert had gone away to\r\nmarry Clara, and I was left in sole charge of the Eastern Branch until\r\nhe brought her back.\r\n\r\nMany a year went round before I was a partner in the House; but I lived\r\nhappily with Herbert and his wife, and lived frugally, and paid my\r\ndebts, and maintained a constant correspondence with Biddy and Joe. It\r\nwas not until I became third in the Firm, that Clarriker betrayed me to\r\nHerbert; but he then declared that the secret of Herbert\xe2\x80\x99s partnership\r\nhad been long enough upon his conscience, and he must tell it. So he\r\ntold it, and Herbert was as much moved as amazed, and the dear fellow\r\nand I were not the worse friends for the long concealment. I must not\r\nleave it to be supposed that we were ever a great House, or that we made\r\nmints of money. We were not in a grand way of business, but we had a\r\ngood name, and worked for our profits, and did very well. We owed so\r\nmuch to Herbert\xe2\x80\x99s ever cheerful industry and readiness, that I often\r\nwondered how I had conceived that old idea of his inaptitude, until I\r\nwas one day enlightened by the reflection, that perhaps the inaptitude\r\nhad never been in him at all, but had been in me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter LIX\r\n\r\nFor eleven years, I had not seen Joe nor Biddy with my bodily\r\neyes,--though they had both been often before my fancy in the\r\nEast,--when, upon an evening in December, an hour or two after dark, I\r\nlaid my hand softly on the latch of the old kitchen door. I touched it\r\nso softly that I was not heard, and looked in unseen. There, smoking his\r\npipe in the old place by the kitchen firelight, as hale and as strong as\r\never, though a little gray, sat Joe; and there, fenced into the corner\r\nwith Joe\xe2\x80\x99s leg, and sitting on my own little stool looking at the fire,\r\nwas--I again!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe giv\xe2\x80\x99 him the name of Pip for your sake, dear old chap,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe,\r\ndelighted, when I took another stool by the child\xe2\x80\x99s side (but I did not\r\nrumple his hair), \xe2\x80\x9cand we hoped he might grow a little bit like you, and\r\nwe think he do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nI thought so too, and I took him out for a walk next morning, and we\r\ntalked immensely, understanding one another to perfection. And I took\r\nhim down to the churchyard, and set him on a certain tombstone there,\r\nand he showed me from that elevation which stone was sacred to the\r\nmemory of Philip Pirrip, late of this Parish, and Also Georgiana, Wife\r\nof the Above.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBiddy,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, when I talked with her after dinner, as her little girl\r\nlay sleeping in her lap, \xe2\x80\x9cyou must give Pip to me one of these days; or\r\nlend him, at all events.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no,\xe2\x80\x9d said Biddy, gently. \xe2\x80\x9cYou must marry.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSo Herbert and Clara say, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I shall, Biddy. I have so\r\nsettled down in their home, that it\xe2\x80\x99s not at all likely. I am already\r\nquite an old bachelor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nBiddy looked down at her child, and put its little hand to her lips, and\r\nthen put the good matronly hand with which she had touched it into mine.\r\nThere was something in the action, and in the light pressure of Biddy\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwedding-ring, that had a very pretty eloquence in it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDear Pip,\xe2\x80\x9d said Biddy, \xe2\x80\x9cyou are sure you don\xe2\x80\x99t fret for her?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cO no,--I think not, Biddy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTell me as an old, old friend. Have you quite forgotten her?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear Biddy, I have forgotten nothing in my life that ever had a\r\nforemost place there, and little that ever had any place there. But that\r\npoor dream, as I once used to call it, has all gone by, Biddy,--all gone\r\nby!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nNevertheless, I knew, while I said those words, that I secretly intended\r\nto revisit the site of the old house that evening, alone, for her sake.\r\nYes, even so. For Estella\xe2\x80\x99s sake.\r\n\r\nI had heard of her as leading a most unhappy life, and as being\r\nseparated from her husband, who had used her with great cruelty, and who\r\nhad become quite renowned as a compound of pride, avarice, brutality,\r\nand meanness. And I had heard of the death of her husband, from an\r\naccident consequent on his ill-treatment of a horse. This release had\r\nbefallen her some two years before; for anything I knew, she was married\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nThe early dinner hour at Joe\xe2\x80\x99s, left me abundance of time, without\r\nhurrying my talk with Biddy, to walk over to the old spot before dark.\r\nBut, what with loitering on the way to look at old objects and to think\r\nof old times, the day had quite declined when I came to the place.\r\n\r\nThere was no house now, no brewery, no building whatever left, but the\r\nwall of the old garden. The cleared space had been enclosed with a rough\r\nfence, and looking over it, I saw that some of the old ivy had struck\r\nroot anew, and was growing green on low quiet mounds of ruin. A gate in\r\nthe fence standing ajar, I pushed it open, and went in.\r\n\r\nA cold silvery mist had veiled the afternoon, and the moon was not yet\r\nup to scatter it. But, the stars were shining beyond the mist, and the\r\nmoon was coming, and the evening was not dark. I could trace out where\r\nevery part of the old house had been, and where the brewery had been,\r\nand where the gates, and where the casks. I had done so, and was looking\r\nalong the desolate garden walk, when I beheld a solitary figure in it.\r\n\r\nThe figure showed itself aware of me, as I advanced. It had been moving\r\ntowards me, but it stood still. As I drew nearer, I saw it to be the\r\nfigure of a woman. As I drew nearer yet, it was about to turn away, when\r\nit stopped, and let me come up with it. Then, it faltered, as if much\r\nsurprised, and uttered my name, and I cried out,--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEstella!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am greatly changed. I wonder you know me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe freshness of her beauty was indeed gone, but its indescribable\r\nmajesty and its indescribable charm remained. Those attractions in it,\r\nI had seen before; what I had never seen before, was the saddened,\r\nsoftened light of the once proud eyes; what I had never felt before was\r\nthe friendly touch of the once insensible hand.\r\n\r\nWe sat down on a bench that was near, and I said, \xe2\x80\x9cAfter so many years,\r\nit is strange that we should thus meet again, Estella, here where our\r\nfirst meeting was! Do you often come back?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have never been here since.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNor I.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe moon began to rise, and I thought of the placid look at the white\r\nceiling, which had passed away. The moon began to rise, and I thought of\r\nthe pressure on my hand when I had spoken the last words he had heard on\r\nearth.\r\n\r\nEstella was the next to break the silence that ensued between us.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have very often hoped and intended to come back, but have been\r\nprevented by many circumstances. Poor, poor old place!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe silvery mist was touched with the first rays of the moonlight, and\r\nthe same rays touched the tears that dropped from her eyes. Not knowing\r\nthat I saw them, and setting herself to get the better of them, she said\r\nquietly,--\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWere you wondering, as you walked along, how it came to be left in this\r\ncondition?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Estella.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe ground belongs to me. It is the only possession I have not\r\nrelinquished. Everything else has gone from me, little by little, but I\r\nhave kept this. It was the subject of the only determined resistance I\r\nmade in all the wretched years.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIs it to be built on?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt last, it is. I came here to take leave of it before its change. And\r\nyou,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, in a voice of touching interest to a wanderer,--\xe2\x80\x9cyou\r\nlive abroad still?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cStill.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd do well, I am sure?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI work pretty hard for a sufficient living, and therefore--yes, I do\r\nwell.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have often thought of you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Estella.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHave you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf late, very often. There was a long hard time when I kept far from me\r\nthe remembrance of what I had thrown away when I was quite ignorant\r\nof its worth. But since my duty has not been incompatible with the\r\nadmission of that remembrance, I have given it a place in my heart.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou have always held your place in my heart,\xe2\x80\x9d I answered.\r\n\r\nAnd we were silent again until she spoke.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI little thought,\xe2\x80\x9d said Estella, \xe2\x80\x9cthat I should take leave of you in\r\ntaking leave of this spot. I am very glad to do so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGlad to part again, Estella? To me, parting is a painful thing. To me,\r\nthe remembrance of our last parting has been ever mournful and painful.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut you said to me,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Estella, very earnestly, \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98God bless you,\r\nGod forgive you!\xe2\x80\x99 And if you could say that to me then, you will not\r\nhesitate to say that to me now,--now, when suffering has been stronger\r\nthan all other teaching, and has taught me to understand what your heart\r\nused to be. I have been bent and broken, but--I hope--into a better\r\nshape. Be as considerate and good to me as you were, and tell me we are\r\nfriends.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe are friends,\xe2\x80\x9d said I, rising and bending over her, as she rose from\r\nthe bench.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd will continue friends apart,\xe2\x80\x9d said Estella.\r\n\r\nI took her hand in mine, and we went out of the ruined place; and, as\r\nthe morning mists had risen long ago when I first left the forge, so the\r\nevening mists were rising now, and in all the broad expanse of tranquil\r\nlight they showed to me, I saw no shadow of another parting from her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Great Expectations, by Charles Dickens\r\n\r\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK GREAT EXPECTATIONS ***\r\n\r\n***** This file should be named 1400-0.txt or 1400-0.zip *****\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/1/4/0/1400/\r\n\r\nProduced by An Anonymous Volunteer\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\r\nwill be renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\r\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\r\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\r\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

The flood had made, the wind was nearly\r\ncalm, and being bound down the river, the only thing for it was to come\r\nto and wait for the turn of the tide.\r\n\r\nThe sea-reach of the Thames stretched before us like the beginning of\r\nan interminable waterway. In the offing the sea and the sky were welded\r\ntogether without a joint, and in the luminous space the tanned sails\r\nof the barges drifting up with the tide seemed to stand still in red\r\nclusters of canvas sharply peaked, with gleams of varnished sprits. A\r\nhaze rested on the low shores that ran out to sea in vanishing flatness.\r\nThe air was dark above Gravesend, and farther back still seemed\r\ncondensed into a mournful gloom, brooding motionless over the biggest,\r\nand the greatest, town on earth.\r\n\r\nThe Director of Companies was our captain and our host. We four\r\naffectionately watched his back as he stood in the bows looking to\r\nseaward. On the whole river there was nothing that looked half so\r\nnautical. He resembled a pilot, which to a seaman is trustworthiness\r\npersonified. It was difficult to realize his work was not out there in\r\nthe luminous estuary, but behind him, within the brooding gloom.\r\n\r\nBetween us there was, as I have already said somewhere, the bond of\r\nthe sea. Besides holding our hearts together through long periods of\r\nseparation, it had the effect of making us tolerant of each other\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nyarns--and even convictions. The Lawyer--the best of old fellows--had,\r\nbecause of his many years and many virtues, the only cushion on deck,\r\nand was lying on the only rug. The Accountant had brought out already a\r\nbox of dominoes, and was toying architecturally with the bones. Marlow\r\nsat cross-legged right aft, leaning against the mizzen-mast. He had\r\nsunken cheeks, a yellow complexion, a straight back, an ascetic aspect,\r\nand, with his arms dropped, the palms of hands outwards, resembled an\r\nidol. The director, satisfied the anchor had good hold, made his way\r\naft and sat down amongst us. We exchanged a few words lazily. Afterwards\r\nthere was silence on board the yacht. For some reason or other we did\r\nnot begin that game of dominoes. We felt meditative, and fit for nothing\r\nbut placid staring. The day was ending in a serenity of still and\r\nexquisite brilliance. The water shone pacifically; the sky, without a\r\nspeck, was a benign immensity of unstained light; the very mist on the\r\nEssex marsh was like a gauzy and radiant fabric, hung from the wooded\r\nrises inland, and draping the low shores in diaphanous folds. Only the\r\ngloom to the west, brooding over the upper reaches, became more sombre\r\nevery minute, as if angered by the approach of the sun.\r\n\r\nAnd at last, in its curved and imperceptible fall, the sun sank low, and\r\nfrom glowing white changed to a dull red without rays and without heat,\r\nas if about to go out suddenly, stricken to death by the touch of that\r\ngloom brooding over a crowd of men.\r\n\r\nForthwith a change came over the waters, and the serenity became less\r\nbrilliant but more profound. The old river in its broad reach rested\r\nunruffled at the decline of day, after ages of good service done to the\r\nrace that peopled its banks, spread out in the tranquil dignity of a\r\nwaterway leading to the uttermost ends of the earth. We looked at the\r\nvenerable stream not in the vivid flush of a short day that comes and\r\ndeparts for ever, but in the august light of abiding memories. And\r\nindeed nothing is easier for a man who has, as the phrase goes,\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cfollowed the sea\xe2\x80\x9d with reverence and affection, than to evoke the\r\ngreat spirit of the past upon the lower reaches of the Thames. The tidal\r\ncurrent runs to and fro in its unceasing service, crowded with memories\r\nof men and ships it had borne to the rest of home or to the battles\r\nof the sea. It had known and served all the men of whom the nation is\r\nproud, from Sir Francis Drake to Sir John Franklin, knights all, titled\r\nand untitled--the great knights-errant of the sea. It had borne all the\r\nships whose names are like jewels flashing in the night of time, from\r\nthe _Golden Hind_ returning with her rotund flanks full of treasure, to be\r\nvisited by the Queen\xe2\x80\x99s Highness and thus pass out of the gigantic tale,\r\nto the _Erebus_ and _Terror_, bound on other conquests--and that never\r\nreturned. It had known the ships and the men. They had sailed from\r\nDeptford, from Greenwich, from Erith--the adventurers and the settlers;\r\nkings\xe2\x80\x99 ships and the ships of men on \xe2\x80\x98Change; captains, admirals, the\r\ndark \xe2\x80\x9cinterlopers\xe2\x80\x9d of the Eastern trade, and the commissioned \xe2\x80\x9cgenerals\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n of East India fleets. Hunters for gold or pursuers of fame, they all\r\nhad gone out on that stream, bearing the sword, and often the torch,\r\nmessengers of the might within the land, bearers of a spark from the\r\nsacred fire. What greatness had not floated on the ebb of that river\r\ninto the mystery of an unknown earth!... The dreams of men, the seed\r\nof commonwealths, the germs of empires.\r\n\r\nThe sun set; the dusk fell on the stream, and lights began to appear\r\nalong the shore. The Chapman light-house, a three-legged thing erect\r\non a mud-flat, shone strongly. Lights of ships moved in the fairway--a\r\ngreat stir of lights going up and going down. And farther west on the\r\nupper reaches the place of the monstrous town was still marked ominously\r\non the sky, a brooding gloom in sunshine, a lurid glare under the stars.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd this also,\xe2\x80\x9d said Marlow suddenly, \xe2\x80\x9chas been one of the dark places\r\nof the earth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was the only man of us who still \xe2\x80\x9cfollowed the sea.\xe2\x80\x9d The worst that\r\ncould be said of him was that he did not represent his class. He was a\r\nseaman, but he was a wanderer, too, while most seamen lead, if one may\r\nso express it, a sedentary life. Their minds are of the stay-at-home\r\norder, and their home is always with them--the ship; and so is their\r\ncountry--the sea. One ship is very much like another, and the sea is\r\nalways the same. In the immutability of their surroundings the foreign\r\nshores, the foreign faces, the changing immensity of life, glide past,\r\nveiled not by a sense of mystery but by a slightly disdainful ignorance;\r\nfor there is nothing mysterious to a seaman unless it be the sea itself,\r\nwhich is the mistress of his existence and as inscrutable as Destiny.\r\nFor the rest, after his hours of work, a casual stroll or a casual spree\r\non shore suffices to unfold for him the secret of a whole continent,\r\nand generally he finds the secret not worth knowing. The yarns of seamen\r\nhave a direct simplicity, the whole meaning of which lies within the\r\nshell of a cracked nut. But Marlow was not typical (if his propensity\r\nto spin yarns be excepted), and to him the meaning of an episode was not\r\ninside like a kernel but outside, enveloping the tale which brought it\r\nout only as a glow brings out a haze, in the likeness of one of these\r\nmisty halos that sometimes are made visible by the spectral illumination\r\nof moonshine.\r\n\r\nHis remark did not seem at all surprising. It was just like Marlow.\r\nIt was accepted in silence. No one took the trouble to grunt even; and\r\npresently he said, very slow--\xe2\x80\x9cI was thinking of very old times, when\r\nthe Romans first came here, nineteen hundred years ago--the other day\r\n.... Light came out of this river since--you say Knights? Yes; but\r\nit is like a running blaze on a plain, like a flash of lightning in the\r\nclouds. We live in the flicker--may it last as long as the old earth\r\nkeeps rolling! But darkness was here yesterday. Imagine the feelings\r\nof a commander of a fine--what d\xe2\x80\x99ye call \xe2\x80\x98em?--trireme in the\r\nMediterranean, ordered suddenly to the north; run overland across the\r\nGauls in a hurry; put in charge of one of these craft the legionaries--a\r\nwonderful lot of handy men they must have been, too--used to build,\r\napparently by the hundred, in a month or two, if we may believe what we\r\nread. Imagine him here--the very end of the world, a sea the colour\r\nof lead, a sky the colour of smoke, a kind of ship about as rigid as a\r\nconcertina--and going up this river with stores, or orders, or what you\r\nlike. Sand-banks, marshes, forests, savages,--precious little to eat\r\nfit for a civilized man, nothing but Thames water to drink. No Falernian\r\nwine here, no going ashore. Here and there a military camp lost in\r\na wilderness, like a needle in a bundle of hay--cold, fog, tempests,\r\ndisease, exile, and death--death skulking in the air, in the water, in\r\nthe bush. They must have been dying like flies here. Oh, yes--he did\r\nit. Did it very well, too, no doubt, and without thinking much about\r\nit either, except afterwards to brag of what he had gone through in his\r\ntime, perhaps. They were men enough to face the darkness. And perhaps he\r\nwas cheered by keeping his eye on a chance of promotion to the fleet at\r\nRavenna by and by, if he had good friends in Rome and survived the awful\r\nclimate. Or think of a decent young citizen in a toga--perhaps too\r\nmuch dice, you know--coming out here in the train of some prefect, or\r\ntax-gatherer, or trader even, to mend his fortunes. Land in a swamp,\r\nmarch through the woods, and in some inland post feel the savagery, the\r\nutter savagery, had closed round him--all that mysterious life of the\r\nwilderness that stirs in the forest, in the jungles, in the hearts of\r\nwild men. There\xe2\x80\x99s no initiation either into such mysteries. He has to\r\nlive in the midst of the incomprehensible, which is also detestable. And\r\nit has a fascination, too, that goes to work upon him. The fascination\r\nof the abomination--you know, imagine the growing regrets, the longing\r\nto escape, the powerless disgust, the surrender, the hate.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe paused.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMind,\xe2\x80\x9d he began again, lifting one arm from the elbow, the palm of the\r\nhand outwards, so that, with his legs folded before him, he had the\r\npose of a Buddha preaching in European clothes and without a\r\nlotus-flower--\xe2\x80\x9cMind, none of us would feel exactly like this. What saves\r\nus is efficiency--the devotion to efficiency. But these chaps were not\r\nmuch account, really. They were no colonists; their administration was\r\nmerely a squeeze, and nothing more, I suspect. They were conquerors, and\r\nfor that you want only brute force--nothing to boast of, when you have\r\nit, since your strength is just an accident arising from the weakness of\r\nothers. They grabbed what they could get for the sake of what was to\r\nbe got. It was just robbery with violence, aggravated murder on a great\r\nscale, and men going at it blind--as is very proper for those who tackle\r\na darkness. The conquest of the earth, which mostly means the taking\r\nit away from those who have a different complexion or slightly flatter\r\nnoses than ourselves, is not a pretty thing when you look into it too\r\nmuch. What redeems it is the idea only. An idea at the back of it; not\r\na sentimental pretence but an idea; and an unselfish belief in the\r\nidea--something you can set up, and bow down before, and offer a\r\nsacrifice to....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe broke off. Flames glided in the river, small green flames, red\r\nflames, white flames, pursuing, overtaking, joining, crossing each\r\nother--then separating slowly or hastily. The traffic of the great city\r\nwent on in the deepening night upon the sleepless river. We looked on,\r\nwaiting patiently--there was nothing else to do till the end of\r\nthe flood; but it was only after a long silence, when he said, in\r\na hesitating voice, \xe2\x80\x9cI suppose you fellows remember I did once turn\r\nfresh-water sailor for a bit,\xe2\x80\x9d that we knew we were fated, before\r\nthe ebb began to run, to hear about one of Marlow\xe2\x80\x99s inconclusive\r\nexperiences.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want to bother you much with what happened to me personally,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n he began, showing in this remark the weakness of many tellers of tales\r\nwho seem so often unaware of what their audience would like best to\r\nhear; \xe2\x80\x9cyet to understand the effect of it on me you ought to know how I\r\ngot out there, what I saw, how I went up that river to the place where I\r\nfirst met the poor chap. It was the farthest point of navigation and the\r\nculminating point of my experience. It seemed somehow to throw a kind\r\nof light on everything about me--and into my thoughts. It was sombre\r\nenough, too--and pitiful--not extraordinary in any way--not very clear\r\neither. No, not very clear. And yet it seemed to throw a kind of light.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had then, as you remember, just returned to London after a lot of\r\nIndian Ocean, Pacific, China Seas--a regular dose of the East--six years\r\nor so, and I was loafing about, hindering you fellows in your work and\r\ninvading your homes, just as though I had got a heavenly mission to\r\ncivilize you. It was very fine for a time, but after a bit I did get\r\ntired of resting. Then I began to look for a ship--I should think the\r\nhardest work on earth. But the ships wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t even look at me. And I got\r\ntired of that game, too.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNow when I was a little chap I had a passion for maps. I would look for\r\nhours at South America, or Africa, or Australia, and lose myself in all\r\nthe glories of exploration. At that time there were many blank spaces on\r\nthe earth, and when I saw one that looked particularly inviting on a map\r\n(but they all look that) I would put my finger on it and say, \xe2\x80\x98When\r\nI grow up I will go there.\xe2\x80\x99 The North Pole was one of these places, I\r\nremember. Well, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t been there yet, and shall not try now. The\r\nglamour\xe2\x80\x99s off. Other places were scattered about the hemispheres. I\r\nhave been in some of them, and... well, we won\xe2\x80\x99t talk about that. But\r\nthere was one yet--the biggest, the most blank, so to speak--that I had\r\na hankering after.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrue, by this time it was not a blank space any more. It had got filled\r\nsince my boyhood with rivers and lakes and names. It had ceased to be\r\na blank space of delightful mystery--a white patch for a boy to dream\r\ngloriously over. It had become a place of darkness. But there was in it\r\none river especially, a mighty big river, that you could see on the map,\r\nresembling an immense snake uncoiled, with its head in the sea, its\r\nbody at rest curving afar over a vast country, and its tail lost in the\r\ndepths of the land. And as I looked at the map of it in a shop-window,\r\nit fascinated me as a snake would a bird--a silly little bird. Then I\r\nremembered there was a big concern, a Company for trade on that river.\r\nDash it all! I thought to myself, they can\xe2\x80\x99t trade without using some\r\nkind of craft on that lot of fresh water--steamboats! Why shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t I\r\ntry to get charge of one? I went on along Fleet Street, but could not\r\nshake off the idea. The snake had charmed me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou understand it was a Continental concern, that Trading society; but\r\nI have a lot of relations living on the Continent, because it\xe2\x80\x99s cheap\r\nand not so nasty as it looks, they say.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am sorry to own I began to worry them. This was already a fresh\r\ndeparture for me. I was not used to get things that way, you know. I\r\nalways went my own road and on my own legs where I had a mind to go. I\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have believed it of myself; but, then--you see--I felt somehow\r\nI must get there by hook or by crook. So I worried them. The men said\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My dear fellow,\xe2\x80\x99 and did nothing. Then--would you believe it?--I tried\r\nthe women. I, Charlie Marlow, set the women to work--to get a job.\r\nHeavens! Well, you see, the notion drove me. I had an aunt, a dear\r\nenthusiastic soul. She wrote: \xe2\x80\x98It will be delightful. I am ready to do\r\nanything, anything for you. It is a glorious idea. I know the wife of a\r\nvery high personage in the Administration, and also a man who has lots\r\nof influence with,\xe2\x80\x99 etc. She was determined to make no end of fuss to\r\nget me appointed skipper of a river steamboat, if such was my fancy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI got my appointment--of course; and I got it very quick. It appears\r\nthe Company had received news that one of their captains had been killed\r\nin a scuffle with the natives. This was my chance, and it made me the\r\nmore anxious to go. It was only months and months afterwards, when I\r\nmade the attempt to recover what was left of the body, that I heard the\r\noriginal quarrel arose from a misunderstanding about some hens. Yes,\r\ntwo black hens. Fresleven--that was the fellow\xe2\x80\x99s name, a Dane--thought\r\nhimself wronged somehow in the bargain, so he went ashore and started to\r\nhammer the chief of the village with a stick. Oh, it didn\xe2\x80\x99t surprise\r\nme in the least to hear this, and at the same time to be told that\r\nFresleven was the gentlest, quietest creature that ever walked on two\r\nlegs. No doubt he was; but he had been a couple of years already out\r\nthere engaged in the noble cause, you know, and he probably felt the\r\nneed at last of asserting his self-respect in some way. Therefore he\r\nwhacked the old nigger mercilessly, while a big crowd of his people\r\nwatched him, thunderstruck, till some man--I was told the chief\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nson--in desperation at hearing the old chap yell, made a tentative jab\r\nwith a spear at the white man--and of course it went quite easy between\r\nthe shoulder-blades. Then the whole population cleared into the forest,\r\nexpecting all kinds of calamities to happen, while, on the other hand,\r\nthe steamer Fresleven commanded left also in a bad panic, in charge of\r\nthe engineer, I believe. Afterwards nobody seemed to trouble much\r\nabout Fresleven\xe2\x80\x99s remains, till I got out and stepped into his shoes. I\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t let it rest, though; but when an opportunity offered at last to\r\nmeet my predecessor, the grass growing through his ribs was tall enough\r\nto hide his bones. They were all there. The supernatural being had not\r\nbeen touched after he fell. And the village was deserted, the huts gaped\r\nblack, rotting, all askew within the fallen enclosures. A calamity\r\nhad come to it, sure enough. The people had vanished. Mad terror had\r\nscattered them, men, women, and children, through the bush, and they had\r\nnever returned. What became of the hens I don\xe2\x80\x99t know either. I should\r\nthink the cause of progress got them, anyhow. However, through this\r\nglorious affair I got my appointment, before I had fairly begun to hope\r\nfor it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI flew around like mad to get ready, and before forty-eight hours I\r\nwas crossing the Channel to show myself to my employers, and sign the\r\ncontract. In a very few hours I arrived in a city that always makes me\r\nthink of a whited sepulchre. Prejudice no doubt. I had no difficulty in\r\nfinding the Company\xe2\x80\x99s offices. It was the biggest thing in the town,\r\nand everybody I met was full of it. They were going to run an over-sea\r\nempire, and make no end of coin by trade.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA narrow and deserted street in deep shadow, high houses, innumerable\r\nwindows with venetian blinds, a dead silence, grass sprouting right and\r\nleft, immense double doors standing ponderously ajar. I slipped through\r\none of these cracks, went up a swept and ungarnished staircase, as arid\r\nas a desert, and opened the first door I came to. Two women, one fat and\r\nthe other slim, sat on straw-bottomed chairs, knitting black wool. The\r\nslim one got up and walked straight at me--still knitting with downcast\r\neyes--and only just as I began to think of getting out of her way, as\r\nyou would for a somnambulist, stood still, and looked up. Her dress was\r\nas plain as an umbrella-cover, and she turned round without a word and\r\npreceded me into a waiting-room. I gave my name, and looked about. Deal\r\ntable in the middle, plain chairs all round the walls, on one end a\r\nlarge shining map, marked with all the colours of a rainbow. There was a\r\nvast amount of red--good to see at any time, because one knows that some\r\nreal work is done in there, a deuce of a lot of blue, a little green,\r\nsmears of orange, and, on the East Coast, a purple patch, to show where\r\nthe jolly pioneers of progress drink the jolly lager-beer. However, I\r\nwasn\xe2\x80\x99t going into any of these. I was going into the yellow. Dead in\r\nthe centre. And the river was there--fascinating--deadly--like a snake.\r\nOugh! A door opened, a white-haired secretarial head, but wearing a\r\ncompassionate expression, appeared, and a skinny forefinger beckoned me\r\ninto the sanctuary. Its light was dim, and a heavy writing-desk squatted\r\nin the middle. From behind that structure came out an impression of pale\r\nplumpness in a frock-coat. The great man himself. He was five feet\r\nsix, I should judge, and had his grip on the handle-end of ever so many\r\nmillions. He shook hands, I fancy, murmured vaguely, was satisfied with\r\nmy French. _Bon Voyage_.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn about forty-five seconds I found myself again in the waiting-room\r\nwith the compassionate secretary, who, full of desolation and sympathy,\r\nmade me sign some document. I believe I undertook amongst other things\r\nnot to disclose any trade secrets. Well, I am not going to.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI began to feel slightly uneasy. You know I am not used to such\r\nceremonies, and there was something ominous in the atmosphere. It\r\nwas just as though I had been let into some conspiracy--I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nknow--something not quite right; and I was glad to get out. In the outer\r\nroom the two women knitted black wool feverishly. People were arriving,\r\nand the younger one was walking back and forth introducing them. The\r\nold one sat on her chair. Her flat cloth slippers were propped up on\r\na foot-warmer, and a cat reposed on her lap. She wore a starched\r\nwhite affair on her head, had a wart on one cheek, and silver-rimmed\r\nspectacles hung on the tip of her nose. She glanced at me above the\r\nglasses. The swift and indifferent placidity of that look troubled me.\r\nTwo youths with foolish and cheery countenances were being piloted over,\r\nand she threw at them the same quick glance of unconcerned wisdom. She\r\nseemed to know all about them and about me, too. An eerie feeling came\r\nover me. She seemed uncanny and fateful. Often far away there I thought\r\nof these two, guarding the door of Darkness, knitting black wool as for\r\na warm pall, one introducing, introducing continuously to the unknown,\r\nthe other scrutinizing the cheery and foolish faces with unconcerned old\r\neyes. _Ave!_ Old knitter of black wool. _Morituri te salutant_. Not\r\nmany of those she looked at ever saw her again--not half, by a long way.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere was yet a visit to the doctor. \xe2\x80\x98A simple formality,\xe2\x80\x99 assured me\r\nthe secretary, with an air of taking an immense part in all my sorrows.\r\nAccordingly a young chap wearing his hat over the left eyebrow, some\r\nclerk I suppose--there must have been clerks in the business, though\r\nthe house was as still as a house in a city of the dead--came from\r\nsomewhere up-stairs, and led me forth. He was shabby and careless, with\r\ninkstains on the sleeves of his jacket, and his cravat was large and\r\nbillowy, under a chin shaped like the toe of an old boot. It was a\r\nlittle too early for the doctor, so I proposed a drink, and thereupon he\r\ndeveloped a vein of joviality. As we sat over our vermouths he glorified\r\nthe Company\xe2\x80\x99s business, and by and by I expressed casually my surprise\r\nat him not going out there. He became very cool and collected all at\r\nonce. \xe2\x80\x98I am not such a fool as I look, quoth Plato to his disciples,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nhe said sententiously, emptied his glass with great resolution, and we\r\nrose.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe old doctor felt my pulse, evidently thinking of something else\r\nthe while. \xe2\x80\x98Good, good for there,\xe2\x80\x99 he mumbled, and then with a certain\r\neagerness asked me whether I would let him measure my head. Rather\r\nsurprised, I said Yes, when he produced a thing like calipers and got\r\nthe dimensions back and front and every way, taking notes carefully. He\r\nwas an unshaven little man in a threadbare coat like a gaberdine, with\r\nhis feet in slippers, and I thought him a harmless fool. \xe2\x80\x98I always ask\r\nleave, in the interests of science, to measure the crania of those going\r\nout there,\xe2\x80\x99 he said. \xe2\x80\x98And when they come back, too?\xe2\x80\x99 I asked. \xe2\x80\x98Oh, I\r\nnever see them,\xe2\x80\x99 he remarked; \xe2\x80\x98and, moreover, the changes take place\r\ninside, you know.\xe2\x80\x99 He smiled, as if at some quiet joke. \xe2\x80\x98So you are\r\ngoing out there. Famous. Interesting, too.\xe2\x80\x99 He gave me a searching\r\nglance, and made another note. \xe2\x80\x98Ever any madness in your family?\xe2\x80\x99 he\r\nasked, in a matter-of-fact tone. I felt very annoyed. \xe2\x80\x98Is that question\r\nin the interests of science, too?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98It would be,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, without\r\ntaking notice of my irritation, \xe2\x80\x98interesting for science to watch the\r\nmental changes of individuals, on the spot, but...\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Are you an\r\nalienist?\xe2\x80\x99 I interrupted. \xe2\x80\x98Every doctor should be--a little,\xe2\x80\x99 answered\r\nthat original, imperturbably. \xe2\x80\x98I have a little theory which you\r\nmessieurs who go out there must help me to prove. This is my share\r\nin the advantages my country shall reap from the possession of such a\r\nmagnificent dependency. The mere wealth I leave to others. Pardon my\r\nquestions, but you are the first Englishman coming under my\r\nobservation...\xe2\x80\x99 I hastened to assure him I was not in the least typical.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98If I were,\xe2\x80\x99 said I, \xe2\x80\x98I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be talking like this with you.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98What\r\nyou say is rather profound, and probably erroneous,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, with a\r\nlaugh. \xe2\x80\x98Avoid irritation more than exposure to the sun. _Adieu_. How do\r\nyou English say, eh? Good-bye. Ah! Good-bye. _Adieu_. In the tropics one\r\nmust before everything keep calm.\xe2\x80\x99... He lifted a warning forefinger....\r\n\xe2\x80\x98_Du calme, du calme_.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne thing more remained to do--say good-bye to my excellent aunt. I\r\nfound her triumphant. I had a cup of tea--the last decent cup of tea for\r\nmany days--and in a room that most soothingly looked just as you would\r\nexpect a lady\xe2\x80\x99s drawing-room to look, we had a long quiet chat by the\r\nfireside. In the course of these confidences it became quite plain to me\r\nI had been represented to the wife of the high dignitary, and goodness\r\nknows to how many more people besides, as an exceptional and gifted\r\ncreature--a piece of good fortune for the Company--a man you don\xe2\x80\x99t get\r\nhold of every day. Good heavens! and I was going to take charge of a\r\ntwo-penny-half-penny river-steamboat with a penny whistle attached! It\r\nappeared, however, I was also one of the Workers, with a capital--you\r\nknow. Something like an emissary of light, something like a lower sort\r\nof apostle. There had been a lot of such rot let loose in print and talk\r\njust about that time, and the excellent woman, living right in the rush\r\nof all that humbug, got carried off her feet. She talked about \xe2\x80\x98weaning\r\nthose ignorant millions from their horrid ways,\xe2\x80\x99 till, upon my word, she\r\nmade me quite uncomfortable. I ventured to hint that the Company was run\r\nfor profit.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98You forget, dear Charlie, that the labourer is worthy of his hire,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nshe said, brightly. It\xe2\x80\x99s queer how out of touch with truth women are.\r\nThey live in a world of their own, and there has never been anything\r\nlike it, and never can be. It is too beautiful altogether, and if they\r\nwere to set it up it would go to pieces before the first sunset. Some\r\nconfounded fact we men have been living contentedly with ever since the\r\nday of creation would start up and knock the whole thing over.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfter this I got embraced, told to wear flannel, be sure to write\r\noften, and so on--and I left. In the street--I don\xe2\x80\x99t know why--a queer\r\nfeeling came to me that I was an imposter. Odd thing that I, who used to\r\nclear out for any part of the world at twenty-four hours\xe2\x80\x99 notice, with\r\nless thought than most men give to the crossing of a street, had a\r\nmoment--I won\xe2\x80\x99t say of hesitation, but of startled pause, before this\r\ncommonplace affair. The best way I can explain it to you is by saying\r\nthat, for a second or two, I felt as though, instead of going to the\r\ncentre of a continent, I were about to set off for the centre of the\r\nearth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI left in a French steamer, and she called in every blamed port they\r\nhave out there, for, as far as I could see, the sole purpose of landing\r\nsoldiers and custom-house officers. I watched the coast. Watching a\r\ncoast as it slips by the ship is like thinking about an enigma. There\r\nit is before you--smiling, frowning, inviting, grand, mean, insipid, or\r\nsavage, and always mute with an air of whispering, \xe2\x80\x98Come and find out.\xe2\x80\x99\r\nThis one was almost featureless, as if still in the making, with\r\nan aspect of monotonous grimness. The edge of a colossal jungle, so\r\ndark-green as to be almost black, fringed with white surf, ran straight,\r\nlike a ruled line, far, far away along a blue sea whose glitter was\r\nblurred by a creeping mist. The sun was fierce, the land seemed to\r\nglisten and drip with steam. Here and there greyish-whitish specks\r\nshowed up clustered inside the white surf, with a flag flying above\r\nthem perhaps. Settlements some centuries old, and still no bigger than\r\npinheads on the untouched expanse of their background. We pounded along,\r\nstopped, landed soldiers; went on, landed custom-house clerks to levy\r\ntoll in what looked like a God-forsaken wilderness, with a tin shed\r\nand a flag-pole lost in it; landed more soldiers--to take care of the\r\ncustom-house clerks, presumably. Some, I heard, got drowned in the surf;\r\nbut whether they did or not, nobody seemed particularly to care. They\r\nwere just flung out there, and on we went. Every day the coast\r\nlooked the same, as though we had not moved; but we passed various\r\nplaces--trading places--with names like Gran\xe2\x80\x99 Bassam, Little Popo; names\r\nthat seemed to belong to some sordid farce acted in front of a sinister\r\nback-cloth. The idleness of a passenger, my isolation amongst all these\r\nmen with whom I had no point of contact, the oily and languid sea, the\r\nuniform sombreness of the coast, seemed to keep me away from the truth\r\nof things, within the toil of a mournful and senseless delusion. The\r\nvoice of the surf heard now and then was a positive pleasure, like the\r\nspeech of a brother. It was something natural, that had its reason, that\r\nhad a meaning. Now and then a boat from the shore gave one a momentary\r\ncontact with reality. It was paddled by black fellows. You could see\r\nfrom afar the white of their eyeballs glistening. They shouted, sang;\r\ntheir bodies streamed with perspiration; they had faces like grotesque\r\nmasks--these chaps; but they had bone, muscle, a wild vitality, an\r\nintense energy of movement, that was as natural and true as the surf\r\nalong their coast. They wanted no excuse for being there. They were a\r\ngreat comfort to look at. For a time I would feel I belonged still to\r\na world of straightforward facts; but the feeling would not last long.\r\nSomething would turn up to scare it away. Once, I remember, we came upon\r\na man-of-war anchored off the coast. There wasn\xe2\x80\x99t even a shed there, and\r\nshe was shelling the bush. It appears the French had one of their wars\r\ngoing on thereabouts. Her ensign dropped limp like a rag; the muzzles\r\nof the long six-inch guns stuck out all over the low hull; the greasy,\r\nslimy swell swung her up lazily and let her down, swaying her thin\r\nmasts. In the empty immensity of earth, sky, and water, there she was,\r\nincomprehensible, firing into a continent. Pop, would go one of the\r\nsix-inch guns; a small flame would dart and vanish, a little white smoke\r\nwould disappear, a tiny projectile would give a feeble screech--and\r\nnothing happened. Nothing could happen. There was a touch of insanity in\r\nthe proceeding, a sense of lugubrious drollery in the sight; and it was\r\nnot dissipated by somebody on board assuring me earnestly there was\r\na camp of natives--he called them enemies!--hidden out of sight\r\nsomewhere.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe gave her her letters (I heard the men in that lonely ship were dying\r\nof fever at the rate of three a day) and went on. We called at some more\r\nplaces with farcical names, where the merry dance of death and trade\r\ngoes on in a still and earthy atmosphere as of an overheated catacomb;\r\nall along the formless coast bordered by dangerous surf, as if Nature\r\nherself had tried to ward off intruders; in and out of rivers, streams\r\nof death in life, whose banks were rotting into mud, whose waters,\r\nthickened into slime, invaded the contorted mangroves, that seemed to\r\nwrithe at us in the extremity of an impotent despair. Nowhere did we\r\nstop long enough to get a particularized impression, but the general\r\nsense of vague and oppressive wonder grew upon me. It was like a weary\r\npilgrimage amongst hints for nightmares.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was upward of thirty days before I saw the mouth of the big river.\r\nWe anchored off the seat of the government. But my work would not begin\r\ntill some two hundred miles farther on. So as soon as I could I made a\r\nstart for a place thirty miles higher up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had my passage on a little sea-going steamer. Her captain was a\r\nSwede, and knowing me for a seaman, invited me on the bridge. He was a\r\nyoung man, lean, fair, and morose, with lanky hair and a shuffling gait.\r\nAs we left the miserable little wharf, he tossed his head contemptuously\r\nat the shore. \xe2\x80\x98Been living there?\xe2\x80\x99 he asked. I said, \xe2\x80\x98Yes.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Fine lot\r\nthese government chaps--are they not?\xe2\x80\x99 he went on, speaking English\r\nwith great precision and considerable bitterness. \xe2\x80\x98It is funny what some\r\npeople will do for a few francs a month. I wonder what becomes of that\r\nkind when it goes upcountry?\xe2\x80\x99 I said to him I expected to see that\r\nsoon. \xe2\x80\x98So-o-o!\xe2\x80\x99 he exclaimed. He shuffled athwart, keeping one eye ahead\r\nvigilantly. \xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t be too sure,\xe2\x80\x99 he continued. \xe2\x80\x98The other day I took\r\nup a man who hanged himself on the road. He was a Swede, too.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Hanged himself! Why, in God\xe2\x80\x99s name?\xe2\x80\x99 I cried. He kept on looking\r\nout watchfully. \xe2\x80\x98Who knows? The sun too much for him, or the country\r\nperhaps.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt last we opened a reach. A rocky cliff appeared, mounds of turned-up\r\nearth by the shore, houses on a hill, others with iron roofs, amongst a\r\nwaste of excavations, or hanging to the declivity. A continuous noise of\r\nthe rapids above hovered over this scene of inhabited devastation. A\r\nlot of people, mostly black and naked, moved about like ants. A jetty\r\nprojected into the river. A blinding sunlight drowned all this at times\r\nin a sudden recrudescence of glare. \xe2\x80\x98There\xe2\x80\x99s your Company\xe2\x80\x99s station,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsaid the Swede, pointing to three wooden barrack-like structures on the\r\nrocky slope. \xe2\x80\x98I will send your things up. Four boxes did you say? So.\r\nFarewell.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI came upon a boiler wallowing in the grass, then found a path\r\nleading up the hill. It turned aside for the boulders, and also for an\r\nundersized railway-truck lying there on its back with its wheels in\r\nthe air. One was off. The thing looked as dead as the carcass of some\r\nanimal. I came upon more pieces of decaying machinery, a stack of rusty\r\nrails. To the left a clump of trees made a shady spot, where dark things\r\nseemed to stir feebly. I blinked, the path was steep. A horn tooted to\r\nthe right, and I saw the black people run. A heavy and dull detonation\r\nshook the ground, a puff of smoke came out of the cliff, and that was\r\nall. No change appeared on the face of the rock. They were building a\r\nrailway. The cliff was not in the way or anything; but this objectless\r\nblasting was all the work going on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cA slight clinking behind me made me turn my head. Six black men\r\nadvanced in a file, toiling up the path. They walked erect and slow,\r\nbalancing small baskets full of earth on their heads, and the clink kept\r\ntime with their footsteps. Black rags were wound round their loins, and\r\nthe short ends behind waggled to and fro like tails. I could see every\r\nrib, the joints of their limbs were like knots in a rope; each had an\r\niron collar on his neck, and all were connected together with a chain\r\nwhose bights swung between them, rhythmically clinking. Another report\r\nfrom the cliff made me think suddenly of that ship of war I had seen\r\nfiring into a continent. It was the same kind of ominous voice; but\r\nthese men could by no stretch of imagination be called enemies. They\r\nwere called criminals, and the outraged law, like the bursting shells,\r\nhad come to them, an insoluble mystery from the sea. All their meagre\r\nbreasts panted together, the violently dilated nostrils quivered, the\r\neyes stared stonily uphill. They passed me within six inches, without a\r\nglance, with that complete, deathlike indifference of unhappy savages.\r\nBehind this raw matter one of the reclaimed, the product of the new\r\nforces at work, strolled despondently, carrying a rifle by its middle.\r\nHe had a uniform jacket with one button off, and seeing a white man on\r\nthe path, hoisted his weapon to his shoulder with alacrity. This was\r\nsimple prudence, white men being so much alike at a distance that he\r\ncould not tell who I might be. He was speedily reassured, and with a\r\nlarge, white, rascally grin, and a glance at his charge, seemed to take\r\nme into partnership in his exalted trust. After all, I also was a part\r\nof the great cause of these high and just proceedings.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cInstead of going up, I turned and descended to the left. My idea was to\r\nlet that chain-gang get out of sight before I climbed the hill. You know\r\nI am not particularly tender; I\xe2\x80\x99ve had to strike and to fend off.\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve had to resist and to attack sometimes--that\xe2\x80\x99s only one way of\r\nresisting--without counting the exact cost, according to the demands\r\nof such sort of life as I had blundered into. I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the devil of\r\nviolence, and the devil of greed, and the devil of hot desire; but, by\r\nall the stars! these were strong, lusty, red-eyed devils, that swayed\r\nand drove men--men, I tell you. But as I stood on this hillside, I\r\nforesaw that in the blinding sunshine of that land I would become\r\nacquainted with a flabby, pretending, weak-eyed devil of a rapacious and\r\npitiless folly. How insidious he could be, too, I was only to find out\r\nseveral months later and a thousand miles farther. For a moment I\r\nstood appalled, as though by a warning. Finally I descended the hill,\r\nobliquely, towards the trees I had seen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI avoided a vast artificial hole somebody had been digging on the\r\nslope, the purpose of which I found it impossible to divine. It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\na quarry or a sandpit, anyhow. It was just a hole. It might have\r\nbeen connected with the philanthropic desire of giving the criminals\r\nsomething to do. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. Then I nearly fell into a very narrow\r\nravine, almost no more than a scar in the hillside. I discovered that\r\na lot of imported drainage-pipes for the settlement had been tumbled in\r\nthere. There wasn\xe2\x80\x99t one that was not broken. It was a wanton smash-up.\r\nAt last I got under the trees. My purpose was to stroll into the shade\r\nfor a moment; but no sooner within than it seemed to me I had stepped\r\ninto the gloomy circle of some Inferno. The rapids were near, and an\r\nuninterrupted, uniform, headlong, rushing noise filled the mournful\r\nstillness of the grove, where not a breath stirred, not a leaf moved,\r\nwith a mysterious sound--as though the tearing pace of the launched\r\nearth had suddenly become audible.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBlack shapes crouched, lay, sat between the trees leaning against the\r\ntrunks, clinging to the earth, half coming out, half effaced within\r\nthe dim light, in all the attitudes of pain, abandonment, and despair.\r\nAnother mine on the cliff went off, followed by a slight shudder of the\r\nsoil under my feet. The work was going on. The work! And this was the\r\nplace where some of the helpers had withdrawn to die.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey were dying slowly--it was very clear. They were not enemies, they\r\nwere not criminals, they were nothing earthly now--nothing but black\r\nshadows of disease and starvation, lying confusedly in the greenish\r\ngloom. Brought from all the recesses of the coast in all the legality\r\nof time contracts, lost in uncongenial surroundings, fed on unfamiliar\r\nfood, they sickened, became inefficient, and were then allowed to crawl\r\naway and rest. These moribund shapes were free as air--and nearly as\r\nthin. I began to distinguish the gleam of the eyes under the trees.\r\nThen, glancing down, I saw a face near my hand. The black bones reclined\r\nat full length with one shoulder against the tree, and slowly the\r\neyelids rose and the sunken eyes looked up at me, enormous and vacant,\r\na kind of blind, white flicker in the depths of the orbs, which died out\r\nslowly. The man seemed young--almost a boy--but you know with them it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhard to tell. I found nothing else to do but to offer him one of my good\r\nSwede\xe2\x80\x99s ship\xe2\x80\x99s biscuits I had in my pocket. The fingers closed slowly\r\non it and held--there was no other movement and no other glance. He had\r\ntied a bit of white worsted round his neck--Why? Where did he get it?\r\nWas it a badge--an ornament--a charm--a propitiatory act? Was there any\r\nidea at all connected with it? It looked startling round his black neck,\r\nthis bit of white thread from beyond the seas.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNear the same tree two more bundles of acute angles sat with their legs\r\ndrawn up. One, with his chin propped on his knees, stared at nothing,\r\nin an intolerable and appalling manner: his brother phantom rested its\r\nforehead, as if overcome with a great weariness; and all about others\r\nwere scattered in every pose of contorted collapse, as in some picture\r\nof a massacre or a pestilence. While I stood horror-struck, one of these\r\ncreatures rose to his hands and knees, and went off on all-fours towards\r\nthe river to drink. He lapped out of his hand, then sat up in the\r\nsunlight, crossing his shins in front of him, and after a time let his\r\nwoolly head fall on his breastbone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t want any more loitering in the shade, and I made haste towards\r\nthe station. When near the buildings I met a white man, in such an\r\nunexpected elegance of get-up that in the first moment I took him for\r\na sort of vision. I saw a high starched collar, white cuffs, a light\r\nalpaca jacket, snowy trousers, a clean necktie, and varnished boots. No\r\nhat. Hair parted, brushed, oiled, under a green-lined parasol held in a\r\nbig white hand. He was amazing, and had a penholder behind his ear.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI shook hands with this miracle, and I learned he was the Company\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nchief accountant, and that all the book-keeping was done at this\r\nstation. He had come out for a moment, he said, \xe2\x80\x98to get a breath of\r\nfresh air. The expression sounded wonderfully odd, with its suggestion\r\nof sedentary desk-life. I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have mentioned the fellow to you at\r\nall, only it was from his lips that I first heard the name of the\r\nman who is so indissolubly connected with the memories of that time.\r\nMoreover, I respected the fellow. Yes; I respected his collars, his\r\nvast cuffs, his brushed hair. His appearance was certainly that of a\r\nhairdresser\xe2\x80\x99s dummy; but in the great demoralization of the land he\r\nkept up his appearance. That\xe2\x80\x99s backbone. His starched collars and got-up\r\nshirt-fronts were achievements of character. He had been out nearly\r\nthree years; and, later, I could not help asking him how he managed to\r\nsport such linen. He had just the faintest blush, and said modestly,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ve been teaching one of the native women about the station. It was\r\ndifficult. She had a distaste for the work.\xe2\x80\x99 Thus this man had verily\r\naccomplished something. And he was devoted to his books, which were in\r\napple-pie order.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cEverything else in the station was in a muddle--heads, things,\r\nbuildings. Strings of dusty niggers with splay feet arrived and\r\ndeparted; a stream of manufactured goods, rubbishy cottons, beads,\r\nand brass-wire sent into the depths of darkness, and in return came a\r\nprecious trickle of ivory.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had to wait in the station for ten days--an eternity. I lived in a\r\nhut in the yard, but to be out of the chaos I would sometimes get into\r\nthe accountant\xe2\x80\x99s office. It was built of horizontal planks, and so badly\r\nput together that, as he bent over his high desk, he was barred from\r\nneck to heels with narrow strips of sunlight. There was no need to\r\nopen the big shutter to see. It was hot there, too; big flies buzzed\r\nfiendishly, and did not sting, but stabbed. I sat generally on the\r\nfloor, while, of faultless appearance (and even slightly scented),\r\nperching on a high stool, he wrote, he wrote. Sometimes he stood up for\r\nexercise. When a truckle-bed with a sick man (some invalid agent from\r\nupcountry) was put in there, he exhibited a gentle annoyance. \xe2\x80\x98The\r\ngroans of this sick person,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, \xe2\x80\x98distract my attention. And\r\nwithout that it is extremely difficult to guard against clerical errors\r\nin this climate.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne day he remarked, without lifting his head, \xe2\x80\x98In the interior you\r\nwill no doubt meet Mr. Kurtz.\xe2\x80\x99 On my asking who Mr. Kurtz was, he\r\nsaid he was a first-class agent; and seeing my disappointment at\r\nthis information, he added slowly, laying down his pen, \xe2\x80\x98He is a very\r\nremarkable person.\xe2\x80\x99 Further questions elicited from him that Mr. Kurtz\r\nwas at present in charge of a trading-post, a very important one, in the\r\ntrue ivory-country, at \xe2\x80\x98the very bottom of there. Sends in as much ivory\r\nas all the others put together...\xe2\x80\x99 He began to write again. The sick\r\nman was too ill to groan. The flies buzzed in a great peace.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuddenly there was a growing murmur of voices and a great tramping of\r\nfeet. A caravan had come in. A violent babble of uncouth sounds burst\r\nout on the other side of the planks. All the carriers were speaking\r\ntogether, and in the midst of the uproar the lamentable voice of the\r\nchief agent was heard \xe2\x80\x98giving it up\xe2\x80\x99 tearfully for the twentieth time\r\nthat day.... He rose slowly. \xe2\x80\x98What a frightful row,\xe2\x80\x99 he said. He\r\ncrossed the room gently to look at the sick man, and returning, said to\r\nme, \xe2\x80\x98He does not hear.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98What! Dead?\xe2\x80\x99 I asked, startled. \xe2\x80\x98No, not yet,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nhe answered, with great composure. Then, alluding with a toss of the\r\nhead to the tumult in the station-yard, \xe2\x80\x98When one has got to make\r\ncorrect entries, one comes to hate those savages--hate them to the\r\ndeath.\xe2\x80\x99 He remained thoughtful for a moment. \xe2\x80\x98When you see Mr. Kurtz\xe2\x80\x99\r\nhe went on, \xe2\x80\x98tell him from me that everything here\xe2\x80\x99--he glanced at the\r\ndeck--\xe2\x80\x99 is very satisfactory. I don\xe2\x80\x99t like to write to him--with those\r\nmessengers of ours you never know who may get hold of your letter--at\r\nthat Central Station.\xe2\x80\x99 He stared at me for a moment with his mild,\r\nbulging eyes. \xe2\x80\x98Oh, he will go far, very far,\xe2\x80\x99 he began again. \xe2\x80\x98He\r\nwill be a somebody in the Administration before long. They, above--the\r\nCouncil in Europe, you know--mean him to be.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe turned to his work. The noise outside had ceased, and presently\r\nin going out I stopped at the door. In the steady buzz of flies the\r\nhomeward-bound agent was lying finished and insensible; the other,\r\nbent over his books, was making correct entries of perfectly correct\r\ntransactions; and fifty feet below the doorstep I could see the still\r\ntree-tops of the grove of death.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNext day I left that station at last, with a caravan of sixty men, for\r\na two-hundred-mile tramp.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo use telling you much about that. Paths, paths, everywhere; a\r\nstamped-in network of paths spreading over the empty land, through the\r\nlong grass, through burnt grass, through thickets, down and up chilly\r\nravines, up and down stony hills ablaze with heat; and a solitude, a\r\nsolitude, nobody, not a hut. The population had cleared out a long\r\ntime ago. Well, if a lot of mysterious niggers armed with all kinds of\r\nfearful weapons suddenly took to travelling on the road between Deal and\r\nGravesend, catching the yokels right and left to carry heavy loads for\r\nthem, I fancy every farm and cottage thereabouts would get empty very\r\nsoon. Only here the dwellings were gone, too. Still I passed through\r\nseveral abandoned villages. There\xe2\x80\x99s something pathetically childish in\r\nthe ruins of grass walls. Day after day, with the stamp and shuffle of\r\nsixty pair of bare feet behind me, each pair under a 60-lb. load. Camp,\r\ncook, sleep, strike camp, march. Now and then a carrier dead in harness,\r\nat rest in the long grass near the path, with an empty water-gourd and\r\nhis long staff lying by his side. A great silence around and above.\r\nPerhaps on some quiet night the tremor of far-off drums, sinking,\r\nswelling, a tremor vast, faint; a sound weird, appealing, suggestive,\r\nand wild--and perhaps with as profound a meaning as the sound of bells\r\nin a Christian country. Once a white man in an unbuttoned uniform,\r\ncamping on the path with an armed escort of lank Zanzibaris, very\r\nhospitable and festive--not to say drunk. Was looking after the upkeep\r\nof the road, he declared. Can\xe2\x80\x99t say I saw any road or any upkeep, unless\r\nthe body of a middle-aged negro, with a bullet-hole in the forehead,\r\nupon which I absolutely stumbled three miles farther on, may be\r\nconsidered as a permanent improvement. I had a white companion, too,\r\nnot a bad chap, but rather too fleshy and with the exasperating habit\r\nof fainting on the hot hillsides, miles away from the least bit of shade\r\nand water. Annoying, you know, to hold your own coat like a parasol over\r\na man\xe2\x80\x99s head while he is coming to. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help asking him once what\r\nhe meant by coming there at all. \xe2\x80\x98To make money, of course. What do you\r\nthink?\xe2\x80\x99 he said, scornfully. Then he got fever, and had to be carried in\r\na hammock slung under a pole. As he weighed sixteen stone I had no end\r\nof rows with the carriers. They jibbed, ran away, sneaked off with their\r\nloads in the night--quite a mutiny. So, one evening, I made a speech in\r\nEnglish with gestures, not one of which was lost to the sixty pairs of\r\neyes before me, and the next morning I started the hammock off in front\r\nall right. An hour afterwards I came upon the whole concern wrecked in\r\na bush--man, hammock, groans, blankets, horrors. The heavy pole had\r\nskinned his poor nose. He was very anxious for me to kill somebody,\r\nbut there wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the shadow of a carrier near. I remembered the old\r\ndoctor--\xe2\x80\x98It would be interesting for science to watch the mental changes\r\nof individuals, on the spot.\xe2\x80\x99 I felt I was becoming scientifically\r\ninteresting. However, all that is to no purpose. On the fifteenth day\r\nI came in sight of the big river again, and hobbled into the Central\r\nStation. It was on a back water surrounded by scrub and forest, with\r\na pretty border of smelly mud on one side, and on the three others\r\nenclosed by a crazy fence of rushes. A neglected gap was all the gate\r\nit had, and the first glance at the place was enough to let you see the\r\nflabby devil was running that show. White men with long staves in their\r\nhands appeared languidly from amongst the buildings, strolling up to\r\ntake a look at me, and then retired out of sight somewhere. One of them,\r\na stout, excitable chap with black moustaches, informed me with great\r\nvolubility and many digressions, as soon as I told him who I was, that\r\nmy steamer was at the bottom of the river. I was thunderstruck. What,\r\nhow, why? Oh, it was \xe2\x80\x98all right.\xe2\x80\x99 The \xe2\x80\x98manager himself\xe2\x80\x99 was there. All\r\nquite correct. \xe2\x80\x98Everybody had behaved splendidly! splendidly!\xe2\x80\x99--\xe2\x80\x98you\r\nmust,\xe2\x80\x99 he said in agitation, \xe2\x80\x98go and see the general manager at once. He\r\nis waiting!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did not see the real significance of that wreck at once. I fancy I\r\nsee it now, but I am not sure--not at all. Certainly the affair was too\r\nstupid--when I think of it--to be altogether natural. Still... But\r\nat the moment it presented itself simply as a confounded nuisance. The\r\nsteamer was sunk. They had started two days before in a sudden hurry\r\nup the river with the manager on board, in charge of some volunteer\r\nskipper, and before they had been out three hours they tore the bottom\r\nout of her on stones, and she sank near the south bank. I asked myself\r\nwhat I was to do there, now my boat was lost. As a matter of fact, I had\r\nplenty to do in fishing my command out of the river. I had to set about\r\nit the very next day. That, and the repairs when I brought the pieces to\r\nthe station, took some months.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cMy first interview with the manager was curious. He did not ask me to\r\nsit down after my twenty-mile walk that morning. He was commonplace in\r\ncomplexion, in features, in manners, and in voice. He was of middle\r\nsize and of ordinary build. His eyes, of the usual blue, were perhaps\r\nremarkably cold, and he certainly could make his glance fall on one as\r\ntrenchant and heavy as an axe. But even at these times the rest of his\r\nperson seemed to disclaim the intention. Otherwise there was\r\nonly an indefinable, faint expression of his lips, something\r\nstealthy--a smile--not a smile--I remember it, but I can\xe2\x80\x99t explain. It\r\nwas unconscious, this smile was, though just after he had said something\r\nit got intensified for an instant. It came at the end of his speeches\r\nlike a seal applied on the words to make the meaning of the commonest\r\nphrase appear absolutely inscrutable. He was a common trader, from his\r\nyouth up employed in these parts--nothing more. He was obeyed, yet he\r\ninspired neither love nor fear, nor even respect. He inspired\r\nuneasiness. That was it! Uneasiness. Not a definite mistrust--just\r\nuneasiness--nothing more. You have no idea how effective such a...\r\na... faculty can be. He had no genius for organizing, for initiative,\r\nor for order even. That was evident in such things as the deplorable\r\nstate of the station. He had no learning, and no intelligence. His\r\nposition had come to him--why? Perhaps because he was never ill... He\r\nhad served three terms of three years out there... Because triumphant\r\nhealth in the general rout of constitutions is a kind of power\r\nin itself. When he went home on leave he rioted on a large\r\nscale--pompously. Jack ashore--with a difference--in externals only.\r\nThis one could gather from his casual talk. He originated nothing, he\r\ncould keep the routine going--that\xe2\x80\x99s all. But he was great. He was great\r\nby this little thing that it was impossible to tell what could control\r\nsuch a man. He never gave that secret away. Perhaps there was nothing\r\nwithin him. Such a suspicion made one pause--for out there there were no\r\nexternal checks. Once when various tropical diseases had laid low almost\r\nevery \xe2\x80\x98agent\xe2\x80\x99 in the station, he was heard to say, \xe2\x80\x98Men who come out\r\nhere should have no entrails.\xe2\x80\x99 He sealed the utterance with that smile\r\nof his, as though it had been a door opening into a darkness he had in\r\nhis keeping. You fancied you had seen things--but the seal was on. When\r\nannoyed at meal-times by the constant quarrels of the white men about\r\nprecedence, he ordered an immense round table to be made, for which a\r\nspecial house had to be built. This was the station\xe2\x80\x99s mess-room. Where\r\nhe sat was the first place--the rest were nowhere. One felt this to be\r\nhis unalterable conviction. He was neither civil nor uncivil. He was\r\nquiet. He allowed his \xe2\x80\x98boy\xe2\x80\x99--an overfed young negro from the coast--to\r\ntreat the white men, under his very eyes, with provoking insolence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe began to speak as soon as he saw me. I had been very long on the\r\nroad. He could not wait. Had to start without me. The up-river stations\r\nhad to be relieved. There had been so many delays already that he did\r\nnot know who was dead and who was alive, and how they got on--and so on,\r\nand so on. He paid no attention to my explanations, and, playing with\r\na stick of sealing-wax, repeated several times that the situation was\r\n\xe2\x80\x98very grave, very grave.\xe2\x80\x99 There were rumours that a very important\r\nstation was in jeopardy, and its chief, Mr. Kurtz, was ill. Hoped it was\r\nnot true. Mr. Kurtz was... I felt weary and irritable. Hang Kurtz,\r\nI thought. I interrupted him by saying I had heard of Mr. Kurtz on the\r\ncoast. \xe2\x80\x98Ah! So they talk of him down there,\xe2\x80\x99 he murmured to himself.\r\nThen he began again, assuring me Mr. Kurtz was the best agent he had, an\r\nexceptional man, of the greatest importance to the Company; therefore\r\nI could understand his anxiety. He was, he said, \xe2\x80\x98very, very uneasy.\xe2\x80\x99\r\nCertainly he fidgeted on his chair a good deal, exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x98Ah, Mr.\r\nKurtz!\xe2\x80\x99 broke the stick of sealing-wax and seemed dumfounded by the\r\naccident. Next thing he wanted to know \xe2\x80\x98how long it would take to\xe2\x80\x99...\r\nI interrupted him again. Being hungry, you know, and kept on my feet\r\ntoo. I was getting savage. \xe2\x80\x98How can I tell?\xe2\x80\x99 I said. \xe2\x80\x98I haven\xe2\x80\x99t even\r\nseen the wreck yet--some months, no doubt.\xe2\x80\x99 All this talk seemed to me\r\nso futile. \xe2\x80\x98Some months,\xe2\x80\x99 he said. \xe2\x80\x98Well, let us say three months before\r\nwe can make a start. Yes. That ought to do the affair.\xe2\x80\x99 I flung out\r\nof his hut (he lived all alone in a clay hut with a sort of verandah)\r\nmuttering to myself my opinion of him. He was a chattering idiot.\r\nAfterwards I took it back when it was borne in upon me startlingly\r\nwith what extreme nicety he had estimated the time requisite for the\r\n\xe2\x80\x98affair.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI went to work the next day, turning, so to speak, my back on that\r\nstation. In that way only it seemed to me I could keep my hold on the\r\nredeeming facts of life. Still, one must look about sometimes; and then\r\nI saw this station, these men strolling aimlessly about in the sunshine\r\nof the yard. I asked myself sometimes what it all meant. They wandered\r\nhere and there with their absurd long staves in their hands, like a lot\r\nof faithless pilgrims bewitched inside a rotten fence. The word \xe2\x80\x98ivory\xe2\x80\x99\r\nrang in the air, was whispered, was sighed. You would think they were\r\npraying to it. A taint of imbecile rapacity blew through it all, like a\r\nwhiff from some corpse. By Jove! I\xe2\x80\x99ve never seen anything so unreal in\r\nmy life. And outside, the silent wilderness surrounding this cleared\r\nspeck on the earth struck me as something great and invincible, like\r\nevil or truth, waiting patiently for the passing away of this fantastic\r\ninvasion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOh, these months! Well, never mind. Various things happened. One\r\nevening a grass shed full of calico, cotton prints, beads, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nknow what else, burst into a blaze so suddenly that you would have\r\nthought the earth had opened to let an avenging fire consume all that\r\ntrash. I was smoking my pipe quietly by my dismantled steamer, and saw\r\nthem all cutting capers in the light, with their arms lifted high, when\r\nthe stout man with moustaches came tearing down to the river, a tin\r\npail in his hand, assured me that everybody was \xe2\x80\x98behaving splendidly,\r\nsplendidly,\xe2\x80\x99 dipped about a quart of water and tore back again. I\r\nnoticed there was a hole in the bottom of his pail.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI strolled up. There was no hurry. You see the thing had gone off like\r\na box of matches. It had been hopeless from the very first. The flame\r\nhad leaped high, driven everybody back, lighted up everything--and\r\ncollapsed. The shed was already a heap of embers glowing fiercely. A\r\nnigger was being beaten near by. They said he had caused the fire in\r\nsome way; be that as it may, he was screeching most horribly. I saw him,\r\nlater, for several days, sitting in a bit of shade looking very sick and\r\ntrying to recover himself; afterwards he arose and went out--and\r\nthe wilderness without a sound took him into its bosom again. As I\r\napproached the glow from the dark I found myself at the back of two men,\r\ntalking. I heard the name of Kurtz pronounced, then the words, \xe2\x80\x98take\r\nadvantage of this unfortunate accident.\xe2\x80\x99 One of the men was the manager.\r\nI wished him a good evening. \xe2\x80\x98Did you ever see anything like it--eh? it\r\nis incredible,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, and walked off. The other man remained. He was\r\na first-class agent, young, gentlemanly, a bit reserved, with a forked\r\nlittle beard and a hooked nose. He was stand-offish with the other\r\nagents, and they on their side said he was the manager\xe2\x80\x99s spy upon them.\r\nAs to me, I had hardly ever spoken to him before. We got into talk, and\r\nby and by we strolled away from the hissing ruins. Then he asked me to\r\nhis room, which was in the main building of the station. He struck\r\na match, and I perceived that this young aristocrat had not only a\r\nsilver-mounted dressing-case but also a whole candle all to himself.\r\nJust at that time the manager was the only man supposed to have any\r\nright to candles. Native mats covered the clay walls; a collection of\r\nspears, assegais, shields, knives was hung up in trophies. The business\r\nintrusted to this fellow was the making of bricks--so I had been\r\ninformed; but there wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a fragment of a brick anywhere in the\r\nstation, and he had been there more than a year--waiting. It seems he\r\ncould not make bricks without something, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what--straw maybe.\r\nAnyway, it could not be found there and as it was not likely to be sent\r\nfrom Europe, it did not appear clear to me what he was waiting for. An\r\nact of special creation perhaps. However, they were all waiting--all\r\nthe sixteen or twenty pilgrims of them--for something; and upon my word\r\nit did not seem an uncongenial occupation, from the way they took it,\r\nthough the only thing that ever came to them was disease--as far as I\r\ncould see. They beguiled the time by back-biting and intriguing against\r\neach other in a foolish kind of way. There was an air of plotting about\r\nthat station, but nothing came of it, of course. It was as unreal as\r\neverything else--as the philanthropic pretence of the whole concern, as\r\ntheir talk, as their government, as their show of work. The only real\r\nfeeling was a desire to get appointed to a trading-post where ivory\r\nwas to be had, so that they could earn percentages. They intrigued\r\nand slandered and hated each other only on that account--but as to\r\neffectually lifting a little finger--oh, no. By heavens! there is\r\nsomething after all in the world allowing one man to steal a horse while\r\nanother must not look at a halter. Steal a horse straight out. Very\r\nwell. He has done it. Perhaps he can ride. But there is a way of looking\r\nat a halter that would provoke the most charitable of saints into a\r\nkick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had no idea why he wanted to be sociable, but as we chatted in\r\nthere it suddenly occurred to me the fellow was trying to get at\r\nsomething--in fact, pumping me. He alluded constantly to Europe, to the\r\npeople I was supposed to know there--putting leading questions as to my\r\nacquaintances in the sepulchral city, and so on. His little eyes\r\nglittered like mica discs--with curiosity--though he tried to keep up a\r\nbit of superciliousness. At first I was astonished, but very soon I\r\nbecame awfully curious to see what he would find out from me. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\npossibly imagine what I had in me to make it worth his while. It was\r\nvery pretty to see how he baffled himself, for in truth my body was full\r\nonly of chills, and my head had nothing in it but that wretched\r\nsteamboat business. It was evident he took me for a perfectly shameless\r\nprevaricator. At last he got angry, and, to conceal a movement of\r\nfurious annoyance, he yawned. I rose. Then I noticed a small sketch in\r\noils, on a panel, representing a woman, draped and blindfolded, carrying\r\na lighted torch. The background was sombre--almost black. The movement\r\nof the woman was stately, and the effect of the torchlight on the face\r\nwas sinister.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt arrested me, and he stood by civilly, holding an empty half-pint\r\nchampagne bottle (medical comforts) with the candle stuck in it. To my\r\nquestion he said Mr. Kurtz had painted this--in this very station more\r\nthan a year ago--while waiting for means to go to his trading post.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Tell me, pray,\xe2\x80\x99 said I, \xe2\x80\x98who is this Mr. Kurtz?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98The chief of the Inner Station,\xe2\x80\x99 he answered in a short tone, looking\r\naway. \xe2\x80\x98Much obliged,\xe2\x80\x99 I said, laughing. \xe2\x80\x98And you are the brickmaker of\r\nthe Central Station. Every one knows that.\xe2\x80\x99 He was silent for a while.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98He is a prodigy,\xe2\x80\x99 he said at last. \xe2\x80\x98He is an emissary of pity and\r\nscience and progress, and devil knows what else. We want,\xe2\x80\x99 he began\r\nto declaim suddenly, \xe2\x80\x98for the guidance of the cause intrusted to us by\r\nEurope, so to speak, higher intelligence, wide sympathies, a singleness\r\nof purpose.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Who says that?\xe2\x80\x99 I asked. \xe2\x80\x98Lots of them,\xe2\x80\x99 he replied. \xe2\x80\x98Some\r\neven write that; and so _he_ comes here, a special being, as you ought to\r\nknow.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Why ought I to know?\xe2\x80\x99 I interrupted, really surprised. He paid\r\nno attention. \xe2\x80\x98Yes. Today he is chief of the best station, next year he\r\nwill be assistant-manager, two years more and... but I dare-say you\r\nknow what he will be in two years\xe2\x80\x99 time. You are of the new gang--the\r\ngang of virtue. The same people who sent him specially also recommended\r\nyou. Oh, don\xe2\x80\x99t say no. I\xe2\x80\x99ve my own eyes to trust.\xe2\x80\x99 Light dawned upon me.\r\nMy dear aunt\xe2\x80\x99s influential acquaintances were producing an unexpected\r\neffect upon that young man. I nearly burst into a laugh. \xe2\x80\x98Do you read\r\nthe Company\xe2\x80\x99s confidential correspondence?\xe2\x80\x99 I asked. He hadn\xe2\x80\x99t a word\r\nto say. It was great fun. \xe2\x80\x98When Mr. Kurtz,\xe2\x80\x99 I continued, severely, \xe2\x80\x98is\r\nGeneral Manager, you won\xe2\x80\x99t have the opportunity.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe blew the candle out suddenly, and we went outside. The moon had\r\nrisen. Black figures strolled about listlessly, pouring water on\r\nthe glow, whence proceeded a sound of hissing; steam ascended in the\r\nmoonlight, the beaten nigger groaned somewhere. \xe2\x80\x98What a row the brute\r\nmakes!\xe2\x80\x99 said the indefatigable man with the moustaches, appearing\r\nnear us. \xe2\x80\x98Serve him right. Transgression--punishment--bang! Pitiless,\r\npitiless. That\xe2\x80\x99s the only way. This will prevent all conflagrations\r\nfor the future. I was just telling the manager...\xe2\x80\x99 He noticed my\r\ncompanion, and became crestfallen all at once. \xe2\x80\x98Not in bed yet,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nhe said, with a kind of servile heartiness; \xe2\x80\x98it\xe2\x80\x99s so natural. Ha!\r\nDanger--agitation.\xe2\x80\x99 He vanished. I went on to the riverside, and\r\nthe other followed me. I heard a scathing murmur at my ear, \xe2\x80\x98Heap\r\nof muffs--go to.\xe2\x80\x99 The pilgrims could be seen in knots gesticulating,\r\ndiscussing. Several had still their staves in their hands. I verily\r\nbelieve they took these sticks to bed with them. Beyond the fence the\r\nforest stood up spectrally in the moonlight, and through that dim stir,\r\nthrough the faint sounds of that lamentable courtyard, the silence of\r\nthe land went home to one\xe2\x80\x99s very heart--its mystery, its greatness, the\r\namazing reality of its concealed life. The hurt nigger moaned feebly\r\nsomewhere near by, and then fetched a deep sigh that made me mend my\r\npace away from there. I felt a hand introducing itself under my arm.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My dear sir,\xe2\x80\x99 said the fellow, \xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to be misunderstood, and\r\nespecially by you, who will see Mr. Kurtz long before I can have\r\nthat pleasure. I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t like him to get a false idea of my\r\ndisposition....\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI let him run on, this _papier-mache_ Mephistopheles, and it seemed to me\r\nthat if I tried I could poke my forefinger through him, and would find\r\nnothing inside but a little loose dirt, maybe. He, don\xe2\x80\x99t you see, had\r\nbeen planning to be assistant-manager by and by under the present man,\r\nand I could see that the coming of that Kurtz had upset them both not a\r\nlittle. He talked precipitately, and I did not try to stop him. I had my\r\nshoulders against the wreck of my steamer, hauled up on the slope like a\r\ncarcass of some big river animal. The smell of mud, of primeval mud,\r\nby Jove! was in my nostrils, the high stillness of primeval forest was\r\nbefore my eyes; there were shiny patches on the black creek. The moon\r\nhad spread over everything a thin layer of silver--over the rank grass,\r\nover the mud, upon the wall of matted vegetation standing higher than\r\nthe wall of a temple, over the great river I could see through a sombre\r\ngap glittering, glittering, as it flowed broadly by without a murmur.\r\nAll this was great, expectant, mute, while the man jabbered about\r\nhimself. I wondered whether the stillness on the face of the immensity\r\nlooking at us two were meant as an appeal or as a menace. What were we\r\nwho had strayed in here? Could we handle that dumb thing, or would it\r\nhandle us? I felt how big, how confoundedly big, was that thing that\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t talk, and perhaps was deaf as well. What was in there? I could\r\nsee a little ivory coming out from there, and I had heard Mr. Kurtz was\r\nin there. I had heard enough about it, too--God knows! Yet somehow\r\nit didn\xe2\x80\x99t bring any image with it--no more than if I had been told an\r\nangel or a fiend was in there. I believed it in the same way one of you\r\nmight believe there are inhabitants in the planet Mars. I knew once a\r\nScotch sailmaker who was certain, dead sure, there were people in Mars.\r\nIf you asked him for some idea how they looked and behaved, he would get\r\nshy and mutter something about \xe2\x80\x98walking on all-fours.\xe2\x80\x99 If you as much\r\nas smiled, he would--though a man of sixty--offer to fight you. I would\r\nnot have gone so far as to fight for Kurtz, but I went for him near\r\nenough to a lie. You know I hate, detest, and can\xe2\x80\x99t bear a lie, not\r\nbecause I am straighter than the rest of us, but simply because it\r\nappalls me. There is a taint of death, a flavour of mortality in\r\nlies--which is exactly what I hate and detest in the world--what I want\r\nto forget. It makes me miserable and sick, like biting something rotten\r\nwould do. Temperament, I suppose. Well, I went near enough to it by\r\nletting the young fool there believe anything he liked to imagine as to\r\nmy influence in Europe. I became in an instant as much of a pretence as\r\nthe rest of the bewitched pilgrims. This simply because I had a notion\r\nit somehow would be of help to that Kurtz whom at the time I did not\r\nsee--you understand. He was just a word for me. I did not see the man in\r\nthe name any more than you do. Do you see him? Do you see the story? Do\r\nyou see anything? It seems to me I am trying to tell you a\r\ndream--making a vain attempt, because no relation of a dream can convey\r\nthe dream-sensation, that commingling of absurdity, surprise, and\r\nbewilderment in a tremor of struggling revolt, that notion of being\r\ncaptured by the incredible which is of the very essence of dreams....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was silent for a while.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c... No, it is impossible; it is impossible to convey the\r\nlife-sensation of any given epoch of one\xe2\x80\x99s existence--that which makes\r\nits truth, its meaning--its subtle and penetrating essence. It is\r\nimpossible. We live, as we dream--alone....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe paused again as if reflecting, then added:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOf course in this you fellows see more than I could then. You see me,\r\nwhom you know....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nIt had become so pitch dark that we listeners could hardly see one\r\nanother. For a long time already he, sitting apart, had been no more\r\nto us than a voice. There was not a word from anybody. The others might\r\nhave been asleep, but I was awake. I listened, I listened on the watch\r\nfor the sentence, for the word, that would give me the clue to the\r\nfaint uneasiness inspired by this narrative that seemed to shape itself\r\nwithout human lips in the heavy night-air of the river.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c... Yes--I let him run on,\xe2\x80\x9d Marlow began again, \xe2\x80\x9cand think what\r\nhe pleased about the powers that were behind me. I did! And there was\r\nnothing behind me! There was nothing but that wretched, old, mangled\r\nsteamboat I was leaning against, while he talked fluently about \xe2\x80\x98the\r\nnecessity for every man to get on.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98And when one comes out here, you\r\nconceive, it is not to gaze at the moon.\xe2\x80\x99 Mr. Kurtz was a \xe2\x80\x98universal\r\ngenius,\xe2\x80\x99 but even a genius would find it easier to work with \xe2\x80\x98adequate\r\ntools--intelligent men.\xe2\x80\x99 He did not make bricks--why, there was a\r\nphysical impossibility in the way--as I was well aware; and if he\r\ndid secretarial work for the manager, it was because \xe2\x80\x98no sensible man\r\nrejects wantonly the confidence of his superiors.\xe2\x80\x99 Did I see it? I saw\r\nit. What more did I want? What I really wanted was rivets, by heaven!\r\nRivets. To get on with the work--to stop the hole. Rivets I\r\nwanted. There were cases of them down at the coast--cases--piled\r\nup--burst--split! You kicked a loose rivet at every second step in that\r\nstation-yard on the hillside. Rivets had rolled into the grove of death.\r\nYou could fill your pockets with rivets for the trouble of stooping\r\ndown--and there wasn\xe2\x80\x99t one rivet to be found where it was wanted. We\r\nhad plates that would do, but nothing to fasten them with. And every\r\nweek the messenger, a long negro, letter-bag on shoulder and staff in\r\nhand, left our station for the coast. And several times a week a coast\r\ncaravan came in with trade goods--ghastly glazed calico that made you\r\nshudder only to look at it, glass beads value about a penny a quart,\r\nconfounded spotted cotton handkerchiefs. And no rivets. Three carriers\r\ncould have brought all that was wanted to set that steamboat afloat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe was becoming confidential now, but I fancy my unresponsive attitude\r\nmust have exasperated him at last, for he judged it necessary to inform\r\nme he feared neither God nor devil, let alone any mere man. I said I\r\ncould see that very well, but what I wanted was a certain quantity of\r\nrivets--and rivets were what really Mr. Kurtz wanted, if he had only\r\nknown it. Now letters went to the coast every week.... \xe2\x80\x98My dear\r\nsir,\xe2\x80\x99 he cried, \xe2\x80\x98I write from dictation.\xe2\x80\x99 I demanded rivets. There was\r\na way--for an intelligent man. He changed his manner; became very\r\ncold, and suddenly began to talk about a hippopotamus; wondered whether\r\nsleeping on board the steamer (I stuck to my salvage night and day)\r\nI wasn\xe2\x80\x99t disturbed. There was an old hippo that had the bad habit of\r\ngetting out on the bank and roaming at night over the station grounds.\r\nThe pilgrims used to turn out in a body and empty every rifle they could\r\nlay hands on at him. Some even had sat up o\xe2\x80\x99 nights for him. All this\r\nenergy was wasted, though. \xe2\x80\x98That animal has a charmed life,\xe2\x80\x99 he said;\r\n\xe2\x80\x98but you can say this only of brutes in this country. No man--you\r\napprehend me?--no man here bears a charmed life.\xe2\x80\x99 He stood there for\r\na moment in the moonlight with his delicate hooked nose set a little\r\naskew, and his mica eyes glittering without a wink, then, with a curt\r\nGood-night, he strode off. I could see he was disturbed and considerably\r\npuzzled, which made me feel more hopeful than I had been for days. It\r\nwas a great comfort to turn from that chap to my influential friend, the\r\nbattered, twisted, ruined, tin-pot steamboat. I clambered on board. She\r\nrang under my feet like an empty Huntley & Palmer biscuit-tin kicked\r\nalong a gutter; she was nothing so solid in make, and rather less pretty\r\nin shape, but I had expended enough hard work on her to make me love\r\nher. No influential friend would have served me better. She had given\r\nme a chance to come out a bit--to find out what I could do. No, I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nlike work. I had rather laze about and think of all the fine things that\r\ncan be done. I don\xe2\x80\x99t like work--no man does--but I like what is in the\r\nwork--the chance to find yourself. Your own reality--for yourself, not\r\nfor others--what no other man can ever know. They can only see the mere\r\nshow, and never can tell what it really means.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was not surprised to see somebody sitting aft, on the deck, with\r\nhis legs dangling over the mud. You see I rather chummed with the few\r\nmechanics there were in that station, whom the other pilgrims naturally\r\ndespised--on account of their imperfect manners, I suppose. This was the\r\nforeman--a boiler-maker by trade--a good worker. He was a lank, bony,\r\nyellow-faced man, with big intense eyes. His aspect was worried, and his\r\nhead was as bald as the palm of my hand; but his hair in falling seemed\r\nto have stuck to his chin, and had prospered in the new locality,\r\nfor his beard hung down to his waist. He was a widower with six young\r\nchildren (he had left them in charge of a sister of his to come out\r\nthere), and the passion of his life was pigeon-flying. He was an\r\nenthusiast and a connoisseur. He would rave about pigeons. After work\r\nhours he used sometimes to come over from his hut for a talk about his\r\nchildren and his pigeons; at work, when he had to crawl in the mud under\r\nthe bottom of the steamboat, he would tie up that beard of his in a kind\r\nof white serviette he brought for the purpose. It had loops to go over\r\nhis ears. In the evening he could be seen squatted on the bank rinsing\r\nthat wrapper in the creek with great care, then spreading it solemnly on\r\na bush to dry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI slapped him on the back and shouted, \xe2\x80\x98We shall have rivets!\xe2\x80\x99 He\r\nscrambled to his feet exclaiming, \xe2\x80\x98No! Rivets!\xe2\x80\x99 as though he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nbelieve his ears. Then in a low voice, \xe2\x80\x98You... eh?\xe2\x80\x99 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know why\r\nwe behaved like lunatics. I put my finger to the side of my nose and\r\nnodded mysteriously. \xe2\x80\x98Good for you!\xe2\x80\x99 he cried, snapped his fingers above\r\nhis head, lifting one foot. I tried a jig. We capered on the iron deck.\r\nA frightful clatter came out of that hulk, and the virgin forest on\r\nthe other bank of the creek sent it back in a thundering roll upon the\r\nsleeping station. It must have made some of the pilgrims sit up in their\r\nhovels. A dark figure obscured the lighted doorway of the manager\xe2\x80\x99s hut,\r\nvanished, then, a second or so after, the doorway itself vanished, too.\r\nWe stopped, and the silence driven away by the stamping of our feet\r\nflowed back again from the recesses of the land. The great wall of\r\nvegetation, an exuberant and entangled mass of trunks, branches, leaves,\r\nboughs, festoons, motionless in the moonlight, was like a rioting\r\ninvasion of soundless life, a rolling wave of plants, piled up, crested,\r\nready to topple over the creek, to sweep every little man of us out\r\nof his little existence. And it moved not. A deadened burst of mighty\r\nsplashes and snorts reached us from afar, as though an icthyosaurus had\r\nbeen taking a bath of glitter in the great river. \xe2\x80\x98After all,\xe2\x80\x99 said the\r\nboiler-maker in a reasonable tone, \xe2\x80\x98why shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t we get the rivets?\xe2\x80\x99\r\nWhy not, indeed! I did not know of any reason why we shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t. \xe2\x80\x98They\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\ncome in three weeks,\xe2\x80\x99 I said confidently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut they didn\xe2\x80\x99t. Instead of rivets there came an invasion, an\r\ninfliction, a visitation. It came in sections during the next three\r\nweeks, each section headed by a donkey carrying a white man in new\r\nclothes and tan shoes, bowing from that elevation right and left to the\r\nimpressed pilgrims. A quarrelsome band of footsore sulky niggers trod on\r\nthe heels of the donkey; a lot of tents, camp-stools, tin boxes, white\r\ncases, brown bales would be shot down in the courtyard, and the air of\r\nmystery would deepen a little over the muddle of the station. Five such\r\ninstalments came, with their absurd air of disorderly flight with the\r\nloot of innumerable outfit shops and provision stores, that, one\r\nwould think, they were lugging, after a raid, into the wilderness for\r\nequitable division. It was an inextricable mess of things decent in\r\nthemselves but that human folly made look like the spoils of thieving.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis devoted band called itself the Eldorado Exploring Expedition, and\r\nI believe they were sworn to secrecy. Their talk, however, was the talk\r\nof sordid buccaneers: it was reckless without hardihood, greedy without\r\naudacity, and cruel without courage; there was not an atom of foresight\r\nor of serious intention in the whole batch of them, and they did not\r\nseem aware these things are wanted for the work of the world. To tear\r\ntreasure out of the bowels of the land was their desire, with no more\r\nmoral purpose at the back of it than there is in burglars breaking into\r\na safe. Who paid the expenses of the noble enterprise I don\xe2\x80\x99t know; but\r\nthe uncle of our manager was leader of that lot.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn exterior he resembled a butcher in a poor neighbourhood, and his\r\neyes had a look of sleepy cunning. He carried his fat paunch with\r\nostentation on his short legs, and during the time his gang infested the\r\nstation spoke to no one but his nephew. You could see these two roaming\r\nabout all day long with their heads close together in an everlasting\r\nconfab.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had given up worrying myself about the rivets. One\xe2\x80\x99s capacity for\r\nthat kind of folly is more limited than you would suppose. I said\r\nHang!--and let things slide. I had plenty of time for meditation,\r\nand now and then I would give some thought to Kurtz. I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t very\r\ninterested in him. No. Still, I was curious to see whether this man, who\r\nhad come out equipped with moral ideas of some sort, would climb to the\r\ntop after all and how he would set about his work when there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne evening as I was lying flat on the deck of my steamboat, I heard\r\nvoices approaching--and there were the nephew and the uncle strolling\r\nalong the bank. I laid my head on my arm again, and had nearly lost\r\nmyself in a doze, when somebody said in my ear, as it were: \xe2\x80\x98I am as\r\nharmless as a little child, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t like to be dictated to. Am I the\r\nmanager--or am I not? I was ordered to send him there. It\xe2\x80\x99s incredible.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n... I became aware that the two were standing on the shore alongside\r\nthe forepart of the steamboat, just below my head. I did not move; it\r\ndid not occur to me to move: I was sleepy. \xe2\x80\x98It _is_ unpleasant,\xe2\x80\x99 grunted\r\nthe uncle. \xe2\x80\x98He has asked the Administration to be sent there,\xe2\x80\x99 said the\r\nother, \xe2\x80\x98with the idea of showing what he could do; and I was instructed\r\naccordingly. Look at the influence that man must have. Is it not\r\nfrightful?\xe2\x80\x99 They both agreed it was frightful, then made several bizarre\r\nremarks: \xe2\x80\x98Make rain and fine weather--one man--the Council--by the\r\nnose\xe2\x80\x99--bits of absurd sentences that got the better of my drowsiness,\r\nso that I had pretty near the whole of my wits about me when the uncle\r\nsaid, \xe2\x80\x98The climate may do away with this difficulty for you. Is he alone\r\nthere?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Yes,\xe2\x80\x99 answered the manager; \xe2\x80\x98he sent his assistant down the\r\nriver with a note to me in these terms: \xe2\x80\x9cClear this poor devil out of\r\nthe country, and don\xe2\x80\x99t bother sending more of that sort. I had rather be\r\nalone than have the kind of men you can dispose of with me.\xe2\x80\x9d It was more\r\nthan a year ago. Can you imagine such impudence!\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Anything since then?\xe2\x80\x99\r\nasked the other hoarsely. \xe2\x80\x98Ivory,\xe2\x80\x99 jerked the nephew; \xe2\x80\x98lots of it--prime\r\nsort--lots--most annoying, from him.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98And with that?\xe2\x80\x99 questioned the\r\nheavy rumble. \xe2\x80\x98Invoice,\xe2\x80\x99 was the reply fired out, so to speak. Then\r\nsilence. They had been talking about Kurtz.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was broad awake by this time, but, lying perfectly at ease, remained\r\nstill, having no inducement to change my position. \xe2\x80\x98How did that ivory\r\ncome all this way?\xe2\x80\x99 growled the elder man, who seemed very vexed. The\r\nother explained that it had come with a fleet of canoes in charge of an\r\nEnglish half-caste clerk Kurtz had with him; that Kurtz had apparently\r\nintended to return himself, the station being by that time bare of goods\r\nand stores, but after coming three hundred miles, had suddenly decided\r\nto go back, which he started to do alone in a small dugout with four\r\npaddlers, leaving the half-caste to continue down the river with the\r\nivory. The two fellows there seemed astounded at anybody attempting such\r\na thing. They were at a loss for an adequate motive. As to me, I seemed\r\nto see Kurtz for the first time. It was a distinct glimpse: the dugout,\r\nfour paddling savages, and the lone white man turning his back suddenly\r\non the headquarters, on relief, on thoughts of home--perhaps; setting\r\nhis face towards the depths of the wilderness, towards his empty and\r\ndesolate station. I did not know the motive. Perhaps he was just simply\r\na fine fellow who stuck to his work for its own sake. His name, you\r\nunderstand, had not been pronounced once. He was \xe2\x80\x98that man.\xe2\x80\x99 The\r\nhalf-caste, who, as far as I could see, had conducted a difficult\r\ntrip with great prudence and pluck, was invariably alluded to as \xe2\x80\x98that\r\nscoundrel.\xe2\x80\x99 The \xe2\x80\x98scoundrel\xe2\x80\x99 had reported that the \xe2\x80\x98man\xe2\x80\x99 had been very\r\nill--had recovered imperfectly.... The two below me moved away then a\r\nfew paces, and strolled back and forth at some little distance. I heard:\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Military post--doctor--two hundred miles--quite alone now--unavoidable\r\ndelays--nine months--no news--strange rumours.\xe2\x80\x99 They approached again,\r\njust as the manager was saying, \xe2\x80\x98No one, as far as I know, unless a\r\nspecies of wandering trader--a pestilential fellow, snapping ivory\r\nfrom the natives.\xe2\x80\x99 Who was it they were talking about now? I gathered in\r\nsnatches that this was some man supposed to be in Kurtz\xe2\x80\x99s district, and\r\nof whom the manager did not approve. \xe2\x80\x98We will not be free from unfair\r\ncompetition till one of these fellows is hanged for an example,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nhe said. \xe2\x80\x98Certainly,\xe2\x80\x99 grunted the other; \xe2\x80\x98get him hanged! Why not?\r\nAnything--anything can be done in this country. That\xe2\x80\x99s what I say;\r\nnobody here, you understand, _here_, can endanger your position. And why?\r\nYou stand the climate--you outlast them all. The danger is in Europe;\r\nbut there before I left I took care to--\xe2\x80\x99 They moved off and whispered,\r\nthen their voices rose again. \xe2\x80\x98The extraordinary series of delays is\r\nnot my fault. I did my best.\xe2\x80\x99 The fat man sighed. \xe2\x80\x98Very sad.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98And the\r\npestiferous absurdity of his talk,\xe2\x80\x99 continued the other; \xe2\x80\x98he bothered\r\nme enough when he was here. \xe2\x80\x9cEach station should be like a beacon on the\r\nroad towards better things, a centre for trade of course, but also for\r\nhumanizing, improving, instructing.\xe2\x80\x9d Conceive you--that ass! And\r\nhe wants to be manager! No, it\xe2\x80\x99s--\xe2\x80\x99 Here he got choked by excessive\r\nindignation, and I lifted my head the least bit. I was surprised to see\r\nhow near they were--right under me. I could have spat upon their hats.\r\nThey were looking on the ground, absorbed in thought. The manager was\r\nswitching his leg with a slender twig: his sagacious relative lifted his\r\nhead. \xe2\x80\x98You have been well since you came out this time?\xe2\x80\x99 he asked. The\r\nother gave a start. \xe2\x80\x98Who? I? Oh! Like a charm--like a charm. But the\r\nrest--oh, my goodness! All sick. They die so quick, too, that I haven\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nthe time to send them out of the country--it\xe2\x80\x99s incredible!\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Hm\xe2\x80\x99m.\r\nJust so,\xe2\x80\x99 grunted the uncle. \xe2\x80\x98Ah! my boy, trust to this--I say, trust to\r\nthis.\xe2\x80\x99 I saw him extend his short flipper of an arm for a gesture that\r\ntook in the forest, the creek, the mud, the river--seemed to beckon\r\nwith a dishonouring flourish before the sunlit face of the land a\r\ntreacherous appeal to the lurking death, to the hidden evil, to the\r\nprofound darkness of its heart. It was so startling that I leaped to my\r\nfeet and looked back at the edge of the forest, as though I had expected\r\nan answer of some sort to that black display of confidence. You know\r\nthe foolish notions that come to one sometimes. The high stillness\r\nconfronted these two figures with its ominous patience, waiting for the\r\npassing away of a fantastic invasion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey swore aloud together--out of sheer fright, I believe--then\r\npretending not to know anything of my existence, turned back to the\r\nstation. The sun was low; and leaning forward side by side, they seemed\r\nto be tugging painfully uphill their two ridiculous shadows of unequal\r\nlength, that trailed behind them slowly over the tall grass without\r\nbending a single blade.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn a few days the Eldorado Expedition went into the patient wilderness,\r\nthat closed upon it as the sea closes over a diver. Long afterwards the\r\nnews came that all the donkeys were dead. I know nothing as to the fate\r\nof the less valuable animals. They, no doubt, like the rest of us, found\r\nwhat they deserved. I did not inquire. I was then rather excited at\r\nthe prospect of meeting Kurtz very soon. When I say very soon I mean\r\nit comparatively. It was just two months from the day we left the creek\r\nwhen we came to the bank below Kurtz\xe2\x80\x99s station.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGoing up that river was like traveling back to the earliest beginnings\r\nof the world, when vegetation rioted on the earth and the big trees were\r\nkings. An empty stream, a great silence, an impenetrable forest. The air\r\nwas warm, thick, heavy, sluggish. There was no joy in the brilliance of\r\nsunshine. The long stretches of the waterway ran on, deserted, into\r\nthe gloom of overshadowed distances. On silvery sand-banks hippos and\r\nalligators sunned themselves side by side. The broadening waters flowed\r\nthrough a mob of wooded islands; you lost your way on that river as you\r\nwould in a desert, and butted all day long against shoals, trying to\r\nfind the channel, till you thought yourself bewitched and cut off for\r\never from everything you had known once--somewhere--far away--in another\r\nexistence perhaps. There were moments when one\xe2\x80\x99s past came back to one,\r\nas it will sometimes when you have not a moment to spare for yourself;\r\nbut it came in the shape of an unrestful and noisy dream, remembered\r\nwith wonder amongst the overwhelming realities of this strange world of\r\nplants, and water, and silence. And this stillness of life did not in\r\nthe least resemble a peace. It was the stillness of an implacable force\r\nbrooding over an inscrutable intention. It looked at you with a vengeful\r\naspect. I got used to it afterwards; I did not see it any more; I had no\r\ntime. I had to keep guessing at the channel; I had to discern, mostly by\r\ninspiration, the signs of hidden banks; I watched for sunken stones; I\r\nwas learning to clap my teeth smartly before my heart flew out, when I\r\nshaved by a fluke some infernal sly old snag that would have ripped the\r\nlife out of the tin-pot steamboat and drowned all the pilgrims; I had to\r\nkeep a lookout for the signs of dead wood we could cut up in the night\r\nfor next day\xe2\x80\x99s steaming. When you have to attend to things of that sort,\r\nto the mere incidents of the surface, the reality--the reality, I tell\r\nyou--fades. The inner truth is hidden--luckily, luckily. But I felt it\r\nall the same; I felt often its mysterious stillness watching me at\r\nmy monkey tricks, just as it watches you fellows performing on your\r\nrespective tight-ropes for--what is it? half-a-crown a tumble--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTry to be civil, Marlow,\xe2\x80\x9d growled a voice, and I knew there was at\r\nleast one listener awake besides myself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI beg your pardon. I forgot the heartache which makes up the rest of\r\nthe price. And indeed what does the price matter, if the trick be well\r\ndone? You do your tricks very well. And I didn\xe2\x80\x99t do badly either, since\r\nI managed not to sink that steamboat on my first trip. It\xe2\x80\x99s a wonder to\r\nme yet. Imagine a blindfolded man set to drive a van over a bad road.\r\nI sweated and shivered over that business considerably, I can tell\r\nyou. After all, for a seaman, to scrape the bottom of the thing that\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsupposed to float all the time under his care is the unpardonable sin.\r\nNo one may know of it, but you never forget the thump--eh? A blow on the\r\nvery heart. You remember it, you dream of it, you wake up at night and\r\nthink of it--years after--and go hot and cold all over. I don\xe2\x80\x99t pretend\r\nto say that steamboat floated all the time. More than once she had to\r\nwade for a bit, with twenty cannibals splashing around and pushing.\r\nWe had enlisted some of these chaps on the way for a crew. Fine\r\nfellows--cannibals--in their place. They were men one could work with,\r\nand I am grateful to them. And, after all, they did not eat each other\r\nbefore my face: they had brought along a provision of hippo-meat\r\nwhich went rotten, and made the mystery of the wilderness stink in my\r\nnostrils. Phoo! I can sniff it now. I had the manager on board and three\r\nor four pilgrims with their staves--all complete. Sometimes we came\r\nupon a station close by the bank, clinging to the skirts of the unknown,\r\nand the white men rushing out of a tumble-down hovel, with great\r\ngestures of joy and surprise and welcome, seemed very strange--had the\r\nappearance of being held there captive by a spell. The word ivory would\r\nring in the air for a while--and on we went again into the silence,\r\nalong empty reaches, round the still bends, between the high walls of\r\nour winding way, reverberating in hollow claps the ponderous beat of the\r\nstern-wheel. Trees, trees, millions of trees, massive, immense, running\r\nup high; and at their foot, hugging the bank against the stream, crept\r\nthe little begrimed steamboat, like a sluggish beetle crawling on the\r\nfloor of a lofty portico. It made you feel very small, very lost, and\r\nyet it was not altogether depressing, that feeling. After all, if you\r\nwere small, the grimy beetle crawled on--which was just what you wanted\r\nit to do. Where the pilgrims imagined it crawled to I don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\r\nTo some place where they expected to get something. I bet! For me it\r\ncrawled towards Kurtz--exclusively; but when the steam-pipes started\r\nleaking we crawled very slow. The reaches opened before us and closed\r\nbehind, as if the forest had stepped leisurely across the water to bar\r\nthe way for our return. We penetrated deeper and deeper into the heart\r\nof darkness. It was very quiet there. At night sometimes the roll of\r\ndrums behind the curtain of trees would run up the river and remain\r\nsustained faintly, as if hovering in the air high over our heads, till\r\nthe first break of day. Whether it meant war, peace, or prayer we could\r\nnot tell. The dawns were heralded by the descent of a chill stillness;\r\nthe wood-cutters slept, their fires burned low; the snapping of a twig\r\nwould make you start. We were wanderers on a prehistoric earth, on an\r\nearth that wore the aspect of an unknown planet. We could have fancied\r\nourselves the first of men taking possession of an accursed inheritance,\r\nto be subdued at the cost of profound anguish and of excessive toil. But\r\nsuddenly, as we struggled round a bend, there would be a glimpse of rush\r\nwalls, of peaked grass-roofs, a burst of yells, a whirl of black limbs,\r\na mass of hands clapping of feet stamping, of bodies swaying, of eyes\r\nrolling, under the droop of heavy and motionless foliage. The steamer\r\ntoiled along slowly on the edge of a black and incomprehensible frenzy.\r\nThe prehistoric man was cursing us, praying to us, welcoming us--who\r\ncould tell? We were cut off from the comprehension of our surroundings;\r\nwe glided past like phantoms, wondering and secretly appalled, as sane\r\nmen would be before an enthusiastic outbreak in a madhouse. We could\r\nnot understand because we were too far and could not remember because we\r\nwere travelling in the night of first ages, of those ages that are gone,\r\nleaving hardly a sign--and no memories.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe earth seemed unearthly. We are accustomed to look upon the shackled\r\nform of a conquered monster, but there--there you could look at a thing\r\nmonstrous and free. It was unearthly, and the men were--No, they were\r\nnot inhuman. Well, you know, that was the worst of it--this suspicion\r\nof their not being inhuman. It would come slowly to one. They howled and\r\nleaped, and spun, and made horrid faces; but what thrilled you was just\r\nthe thought of their humanity--like yours--the thought of your remote\r\nkinship with this wild and passionate uproar. Ugly. Yes, it was ugly\r\nenough; but if you were man enough you would admit to yourself that\r\nthere was in you just the faintest trace of a response to the terrible\r\nfrankness of that noise, a dim suspicion of there being a meaning in it\r\nwhich you--you so remote from the night of first ages--could comprehend.\r\nAnd why not? The mind of man is capable of anything--because everything\r\nis in it, all the past as well as all the future. What was there after\r\nall? Joy, fear, sorrow, devotion, valour, rage--who can tell?--but\r\ntruth--truth stripped of its cloak of time. Let the fool gape and\r\nshudder--the man knows, and can look on without a wink. But he must at\r\nleast be as much of a man as these on the shore. He must meet that truth\r\nwith his own true stuff--with his own inborn strength. Principles won\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ndo. Acquisitions, clothes, pretty rags--rags that would fly off at the\r\nfirst good shake. No; you want a deliberate belief. An appeal to me in\r\nthis fiendish row--is there? Very well; I hear; I admit, but I have\r\na voice, too, and for good or evil mine is the speech that cannot be\r\nsilenced. Of course, a fool, what with sheer fright and fine sentiments,\r\nis always safe. Who\xe2\x80\x99s that grunting? You wonder I didn\xe2\x80\x99t go ashore for\r\na howl and a dance? Well, no--I didn\xe2\x80\x99t. Fine sentiments, you say?\r\nFine sentiments, be hanged! I had no time. I had to mess about with\r\nwhite-lead and strips of woolen blanket helping to put bandages on\r\nthose leaky steam-pipes--I tell you. I had to watch the steering, and\r\ncircumvent those snags, and get the tin-pot along by hook or by crook.\r\nThere was surface-truth enough in these things to save a wiser man. And\r\nbetween whiles I had to look after the savage who was fireman. He was\r\nan improved specimen; he could fire up a vertical boiler. He was there\r\nbelow me, and, upon my word, to look at him was as edifying as seeing a\r\ndog in a parody of breeches and a feather hat, walking on his hind-legs.\r\nA few months of training had done for that really fine chap. He squinted\r\nat the steam-gauge and at the water-gauge with an evident effort of\r\nintrepidity--and he had filed teeth, too, the poor devil, and the wool\r\nof his pate shaved into queer patterns, and three ornamental scars\r\non each of his cheeks. He ought to have been clapping his hands and\r\nstamping his feet on the bank, instead of which he was hard at work, a\r\nthrall to strange witchcraft, full of improving knowledge. He was useful\r\nbecause he had been instructed; and what he knew was this--that should\r\nthe water in that transparent thing disappear, the evil spirit inside\r\nthe boiler would get angry through the greatness of his thirst, and take\r\na terrible vengeance. So he sweated and fired up and watched the glass\r\nfearfully (with an impromptu charm, made of rags, tied to his arm, and\r\na piece of polished bone, as big as a watch, stuck flatways through his\r\nlower lip), while the wooded banks slipped past us slowly, the short\r\nnoise was left behind, the interminable miles of silence--and we crept\r\non, towards Kurtz. But the snags were thick, the water was treacherous\r\nand shallow, the boiler seemed indeed to have a sulky devil in it, and\r\nthus neither that fireman nor I had any time to peer into our creepy\r\nthoughts.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSome fifty miles below the Inner Station we came upon a hut of reeds,\r\nan inclined and melancholy pole, with the unrecognizable tatters of\r\nwhat had been a flag of some sort flying from it, and a neatly stacked\r\nwood-pile. This was unexpected. We came to the bank, and on the stack of\r\nfirewood found a flat piece of board with some faded pencil-writing\r\non it. When deciphered it said: \xe2\x80\x98Wood for you. Hurry up. Approach\r\ncautiously.\xe2\x80\x99 There was a signature, but it was illegible--not\r\nKurtz--a much longer word. \xe2\x80\x98Hurry up.\xe2\x80\x99 Where? Up the river? \xe2\x80\x98Approach\r\ncautiously.\xe2\x80\x99 We had not done so. But the warning could not have been\r\nmeant for the place where it could be only found after approach.\r\nSomething was wrong above. But what--and how much? That was the\r\nquestion. We commented adversely upon the imbecility of that telegraphic\r\nstyle. The bush around said nothing, and would not let us look very far,\r\neither. A torn curtain of red twill hung in the doorway of the hut, and\r\nflapped sadly in our faces. The dwelling was dismantled; but we could\r\nsee a white man had lived there not very long ago. There remained a rude\r\ntable--a plank on two posts; a heap of rubbish reposed in a dark corner,\r\nand by the door I picked up a book. It had lost its covers, and the\r\npages had been thumbed into a state of extremely dirty softness; but the\r\nback had been lovingly stitched afresh with white cotton thread, which\r\nlooked clean yet. It was an extraordinary find. Its title was, _An\r\nInquiry into some Points of Seamanship_, by a man Towser, Towson--some\r\nsuch name--Master in his Majesty\xe2\x80\x99s Navy. The matter looked dreary\r\nreading enough, with illustrative diagrams and repulsive tables of\r\nfigures, and the copy was sixty years old. I handled this amazing\r\nantiquity with the greatest possible tenderness, lest it should dissolve\r\nin my hands. Within, Towson or Towser was inquiring earnestly into the\r\nbreaking strain of ships\xe2\x80\x99 chains and tackle, and other such matters. Not\r\na very enthralling book; but at the first glance you could see there a\r\nsingleness of intention, an honest concern for the right way of going\r\nto work, which made these humble pages, thought out so many years ago,\r\nluminous with another than a professional light. The simple old sailor,\r\nwith his talk of chains and purchases, made me forget the jungle and\r\nthe pilgrims in a delicious sensation of having come upon something\r\nunmistakably real. Such a book being there was wonderful enough; but\r\nstill more astounding were the notes pencilled in the margin, and\r\nplainly referring to the text. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t believe my eyes! They were in\r\ncipher! Yes, it looked like cipher. Fancy a man lugging with him a\r\nbook of that description into this nowhere and studying it--and making\r\nnotes--in cipher at that! It was an extravagant mystery.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had been dimly aware for some time of a worrying noise, and when I\r\nlifted my eyes I saw the wood-pile was gone, and the manager, aided by\r\nall the pilgrims, was shouting at me from the riverside. I slipped the\r\nbook into my pocket. I assure you to leave off reading was like tearing\r\nmyself away from the shelter of an old and solid friendship.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI started the lame engine ahead. \xe2\x80\x98It must be this miserable trader--this\r\nintruder,\xe2\x80\x99 exclaimed the manager, looking back malevolently at the place\r\nwe had left. \xe2\x80\x98He must be English,\xe2\x80\x99 I said. \xe2\x80\x98It will not save him from\r\ngetting into trouble if he is not careful,\xe2\x80\x99 muttered the manager darkly.\r\nI observed with assumed innocence that no man was safe from trouble in\r\nthis world.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe current was more rapid now, the steamer seemed at her last gasp,\r\nthe stern-wheel flopped languidly, and I caught myself listening on\r\ntiptoe for the next beat of the boat, for in sober truth I expected the\r\nwretched thing to give up every moment. It was like watching the last\r\nflickers of a life. But still we crawled. Sometimes I would pick out a\r\ntree a little way ahead to measure our progress towards Kurtz by, but\r\nI lost it invariably before we got abreast. To keep the eyes so long\r\non one thing was too much for human patience. The manager displayed\r\na beautiful resignation. I fretted and fumed and took to arguing with\r\nmyself whether or no I would talk openly with Kurtz; but before I could\r\ncome to any conclusion it occurred to me that my speech or my silence,\r\nindeed any action of mine, would be a mere futility. What did it matter\r\nwhat any one knew or ignored? What did it matter who was manager? One\r\ngets sometimes such a flash of insight. The essentials of this affair\r\nlay deep under the surface, beyond my reach, and beyond my power of\r\nmeddling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTowards the evening of the second day we judged ourselves about eight\r\nmiles from Kurtz\xe2\x80\x99s station. I wanted to push on; but the manager looked\r\ngrave, and told me the navigation up there was so dangerous that it\r\nwould be advisable, the sun being very low already, to wait where we\r\nwere till next morning. Moreover, he pointed out that if the warning\r\nto approach cautiously were to be followed, we must approach in\r\ndaylight--not at dusk or in the dark. This was sensible enough. Eight\r\nmiles meant nearly three hours\xe2\x80\x99 steaming for us, and I could also see\r\nsuspicious ripples at the upper end of the reach. Nevertheless, I was\r\nannoyed beyond expression at the delay, and most unreasonably, too,\r\nsince one night more could not matter much after so many months. As we\r\nhad plenty of wood, and caution was the word, I brought up in the middle\r\nof the stream. The reach was narrow, straight, with high sides like a\r\nrailway cutting. The dusk came gliding into it long before the sun had\r\nset. The current ran smooth and swift, but a dumb immobility sat on the\r\nbanks. The living trees, lashed together by the creepers and every\r\nliving bush of the undergrowth, might have been changed into stone, even\r\nto the slenderest twig, to the lightest leaf. It was not sleep--it\r\nseemed unnatural, like a state of trance. Not the faintest sound of any\r\nkind could be heard. You looked on amazed, and began to suspect yourself\r\nof being deaf--then the night came suddenly, and struck you blind as\r\nwell. About three in the morning some large fish leaped, and the loud\r\nsplash made me jump as though a gun had been fired. When the sun rose\r\nthere was a white fog, very warm and clammy, and more blinding than the\r\nnight. It did not shift or drive; it was just there, standing all round\r\nyou like something solid. At eight or nine, perhaps, it lifted as a\r\nshutter lifts. We had a glimpse of the towering multitude of trees, of\r\nthe immense matted jungle, with the blazing little ball of the sun\r\nhanging over it--all perfectly still--and then the white shutter came\r\ndown again, smoothly, as if sliding in greased grooves. I ordered the\r\nchain, which we had begun to heave in, to be paid out again. Before it\r\nstopped running with a muffled rattle, a cry, a very loud cry, as of\r\ninfinite desolation, soared slowly in the opaque air. It ceased. A\r\ncomplaining clamour, modulated in savage discords, filled our ears. The\r\nsheer unexpectedness of it made my hair stir under my cap. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know\r\nhow it struck the others: to me it seemed as though the mist itself had\r\nscreamed, so suddenly, and apparently from all sides at once, did this\r\ntumultuous and mournful uproar arise. It culminated in a hurried\r\noutbreak of almost intolerably excessive shrieking, which stopped short,\r\nleaving us stiffened in a variety of silly attitudes, and obstinately\r\nlistening to the nearly as appalling and excessive silence. \xe2\x80\x98Good God!\r\nWhat is the meaning--\xe2\x80\x99 stammered at my elbow one of the pilgrims--a\r\nlittle fat man, with sandy hair and red whiskers, who wore sidespring\r\nboots, and pink pyjamas tucked into his socks. Two others remained\r\nopen-mouthed a while minute, then dashed into the little cabin, to rush\r\nout incontinently and stand darting scared glances, with Winchesters at\r\n\xe2\x80\x98ready\xe2\x80\x99 in their hands. What we could see was just the steamer we were\r\non, her outlines blurred as though she had been on the point of\r\ndissolving, and a misty strip of water, perhaps two feet broad, around\r\nher--and that was all. The rest of the world was nowhere, as far as our\r\neyes and ears were concerned. Just nowhere. Gone, disappeared; swept off\r\nwithout leaving a whisper or a shadow behind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI went forward, and ordered the chain to be hauled in short, so as to\r\nbe ready to trip the anchor and move the steamboat at once if necessary.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Will they attack?\xe2\x80\x99 whispered an awed voice. \xe2\x80\x98We will be all butchered\r\nin this fog,\xe2\x80\x99 murmured another. The faces twitched with the strain, the\r\nhands trembled slightly, the eyes forgot to wink. It was very curious\r\nto see the contrast of expressions of the white men and of the black\r\nfellows of our crew, who were as much strangers to that part of the\r\nriver as we, though their homes were only eight hundred miles away. The\r\nwhites, of course greatly discomposed, had besides a curious look of\r\nbeing painfully shocked by such an outrageous row. The others had an\r\nalert, naturally interested expression; but their faces were essentially\r\nquiet, even those of the one or two who grinned as they hauled at the\r\nchain. Several exchanged short, grunting phrases, which seemed to settle\r\nthe matter to their satisfaction. Their headman, a young, broad-chested\r\nblack, severely draped in dark-blue fringed cloths, with fierce nostrils\r\nand his hair all done up artfully in oily ringlets, stood near me.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Aha!\xe2\x80\x99 I said, just for good fellowship\xe2\x80\x99s sake. \xe2\x80\x98Catch \xe2\x80\x98im,\xe2\x80\x99 he snapped,\r\nwith a bloodshot widening of his eyes and a flash of sharp teeth--\xe2\x80\x98catch\r\n\xe2\x80\x98im. Give \xe2\x80\x98im to us.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98To you, eh?\xe2\x80\x99 I asked; \xe2\x80\x98what would you do with\r\nthem?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Eat \xe2\x80\x98im!\xe2\x80\x99 he said curtly, and, leaning his elbow on the rail,\r\nlooked out into the fog in a dignified and profoundly pensive attitude.\r\nI would no doubt have been properly horrified, had it not occurred to\r\nme that he and his chaps must be very hungry: that they must have been\r\ngrowing increasingly hungry for at least this month past. They had been\r\nengaged for six months (I don\xe2\x80\x99t think a single one of them had any\r\nclear idea of time, as we at the end of countless ages have. They still\r\nbelonged to the beginnings of time--had no inherited experience to teach\r\nthem as it were), and of course, as long as there was a piece of paper\r\nwritten over in accordance with some farcical law or other made down the\r\nriver, it didn\xe2\x80\x99t enter anybody\xe2\x80\x99s head to trouble how they would live.\r\nCertainly they had brought with them some rotten hippo-meat, which\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have lasted very long, anyway, even if the pilgrims hadn\xe2\x80\x99t, in\r\nthe midst of a shocking hullabaloo, thrown a considerable quantity of it\r\noverboard. It looked like a high-handed proceeding; but it was really\r\na case of legitimate self-defence. You can\xe2\x80\x99t breathe dead hippo waking,\r\nsleeping, and eating, and at the same time keep your precarious grip on\r\nexistence. Besides that, they had given them every week three pieces of\r\nbrass wire, each about nine inches long; and the theory was they were to\r\nbuy their provisions with that currency in riverside villages. You can\r\nsee how _that_ worked. There were either no villages, or the people were\r\nhostile, or the director, who like the rest of us fed out of tins, with\r\nan occasional old he-goat thrown in, didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to stop the steamer for\r\nsome more or less recondite reason. So, unless they swallowed the wire\r\nitself, or made loops of it to snare the fishes with, I don\xe2\x80\x99t see what\r\ngood their extravagant salary could be to them. I must say it was paid\r\nwith a regularity worthy of a large and honourable trading company. For\r\nthe rest, the only thing to eat--though it didn\xe2\x80\x99t look eatable in the\r\nleast--I saw in their possession was a few lumps of some stuff like\r\nhalf-cooked dough, of a dirty lavender colour, they kept wrapped in\r\nleaves, and now and then swallowed a piece of, but so small that it\r\nseemed done more for the looks of the thing than for any serious purpose\r\nof sustenance. Why in the name of all the gnawing devils of hunger they\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t go for us--they were thirty to five--and have a good tuck-in for\r\nonce, amazes me now when I think of it. They were big powerful men,\r\nwith not much capacity to weigh the consequences, with courage, with\r\nstrength, even yet, though their skins were no longer glossy and their\r\nmuscles no longer hard. And I saw that something restraining, one of\r\nthose human secrets that baffle probability, had come into play there.\r\nI looked at them with a swift quickening of interest--not because it\r\noccurred to me I might be eaten by them before very long, though I own\r\nto you that just then I perceived--in a new light, as it were--how\r\nunwholesome the pilgrims looked, and I hoped, yes, I positively hoped,\r\nthat my aspect was not so--what shall I say?--so--unappetizing: a touch\r\nof fantastic vanity which fitted well with the dream-sensation that\r\npervaded all my days at that time. Perhaps I had a little fever, too.\r\nOne can\xe2\x80\x99t live with one\xe2\x80\x99s finger everlastingly on one\xe2\x80\x99s pulse. I had\r\noften \xe2\x80\x98a little fever,\xe2\x80\x99 or a little touch of other things--the playful\r\npaw-strokes of the wilderness, the preliminary trifling before the more\r\nserious onslaught which came in due course. Yes; I looked at them as you\r\nwould on any human being, with a curiosity of their impulses, motives,\r\ncapacities, weaknesses, when brought to the test of an inexorable\r\nphysical necessity. Restraint! What possible restraint? Was it\r\nsuperstition, disgust, patience, fear--or some kind of primitive honour?\r\nNo fear can stand up to hunger, no patience can wear it out, disgust\r\nsimply does not exist where hunger is; and as to superstition, beliefs,\r\nand what you may call principles, they are less than chaff in a breeze.\r\nDon\xe2\x80\x99t you know the devilry of lingering starvation, its exasperating\r\ntorment, its black thoughts, its sombre and brooding ferocity? Well,\r\nI do. It takes a man all his inborn strength to fight hunger properly.\r\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s really easier to face bereavement, dishonour, and the perdition of\r\none\xe2\x80\x99s soul--than this kind of prolonged hunger. Sad, but true. And these\r\nchaps, too, had no earthly reason for any kind of scruple. Restraint! I\r\nwould just as soon have expected restraint from a hyena prowling amongst\r\nthe corpses of a battlefield. But there was the fact facing me--the fact\r\ndazzling, to be seen, like the foam on the depths of the sea, like a\r\nripple on an unfathomable enigma, a mystery greater--when I thought\r\nof it--than the curious, inexplicable note of desperate grief in this\r\nsavage clamour that had swept by us on the river-bank, behind the blind\r\nwhiteness of the fog.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cTwo pilgrims were quarrelling in hurried whispers as to which bank.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Left.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98no, no; how can you? Right, right, of course.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98It is very\r\nserious,\xe2\x80\x99 said the manager\xe2\x80\x99s voice behind me; \xe2\x80\x98I would be desolated if\r\nanything should happen to Mr. Kurtz before we came up.\xe2\x80\x99 I looked at him,\r\nand had not the slightest doubt he was sincere. He was just the kind of\r\nman who would wish to preserve appearances. That was his restraint. But\r\nwhen he muttered something about going on at once, I did not even take\r\nthe trouble to answer him. I knew, and he knew, that it was impossible.\r\nWere we to let go our hold of the bottom, we would be absolutely in\r\nthe air--in space. We wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be able to tell where we were going\r\nto--whether up or down stream, or across--till we fetched against one\r\nbank or the other--and then we wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t know at first which it was.\r\nOf course I made no move. I had no mind for a smash-up. You couldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nimagine a more deadly place for a shipwreck. Whether we drowned at\r\nonce or not, we were sure to perish speedily in one way or another. \xe2\x80\x98I\r\nauthorize you to take all the risks,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, after a short silence.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I refuse to take any,\xe2\x80\x99 I said shortly; which was just the answer he\r\nexpected, though its tone might have surprised him. \xe2\x80\x98Well, I must defer\r\nto your judgment. You are captain,\xe2\x80\x99 he said with marked civility. I\r\nturned my shoulder to him in sign of my appreciation, and looked into\r\nthe fog. How long would it last? It was the most hopeless lookout. The\r\napproach to this Kurtz grubbing for ivory in the wretched bush was beset\r\nby as many dangers as though he had been an enchanted princess sleeping\r\nin a fabulous castle. \xe2\x80\x98Will they attack, do you think?\xe2\x80\x99 asked the\r\nmanager, in a confidential tone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI did not think they would attack, for several obvious reasons. The\r\nthick fog was one. If they left the bank in their canoes they would get\r\nlost in it, as we would be if we attempted to move. Still, I had also\r\njudged the jungle of both banks quite impenetrable--and yet eyes were\r\nin it, eyes that had seen us. The riverside bushes were certainly very\r\nthick; but the undergrowth behind was evidently penetrable.\r\nHowever, during the short lift I had seen no canoes anywhere in the\r\nreach--certainly not abreast of the steamer. But what made the idea of\r\nattack inconceivable to me was the nature of the noise--of the cries we\r\nhad heard. They had not the fierce character boding immediate hostile\r\nintention. Unexpected, wild, and violent as they had been, they had\r\ngiven me an irresistible impression of sorrow. The glimpse of the\r\nsteamboat had for some reason filled those savages with unrestrained\r\ngrief. The danger, if any, I expounded, was from our proximity to a\r\ngreat human passion let loose. Even extreme grief may ultimately vent\r\nitself in violence--but more generally takes the form of apathy....\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou should have seen the pilgrims stare! They had no heart to grin, or\r\neven to revile me: but I believe they thought me gone mad--with fright,\r\nmaybe. I delivered a regular lecture. My dear boys, it was no good\r\nbothering. Keep a lookout? Well, you may guess I watched the fog for\r\nthe signs of lifting as a cat watches a mouse; but for anything else our\r\neyes were of no more use to us than if we had been buried miles deep in\r\na heap of cotton-wool. It felt like it, too--choking, warm, stifling.\r\nBesides, all I said, though it sounded extravagant, was absolutely\r\ntrue to fact. What we afterwards alluded to as an attack was really an\r\nattempt at repulse. The action was very far from being aggressive--it\r\nwas not even defensive, in the usual sense: it was undertaken under the\r\nstress of desperation, and in its essence was purely protective.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt developed itself, I should say, two hours after the fog lifted, and\r\nits commencement was at a spot, roughly speaking, about a mile and a\r\nhalf below Kurtz\xe2\x80\x99s station. We had just floundered and flopped round a\r\nbend, when I saw an islet, a mere grassy hummock of bright green, in the\r\nmiddle of the stream. It was the only thing of the kind; but as we opened\r\nthe reach more, I perceived it was the head of a long sand-bank, or\r\nrather of a chain of shallow patches stretching down the middle of the\r\nriver. They were discoloured, just awash, and the whole lot was seen\r\njust under the water, exactly as a man\xe2\x80\x99s backbone is seen running down\r\nthe middle of his back under the skin. Now, as far as I did see, I could\r\ngo to the right or to the left of this. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know either channel, of\r\ncourse. The banks looked pretty well alike, the depth appeared the same;\r\nbut as I had been informed the station was on the west side, I naturally\r\nheaded for the western passage.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo sooner had we fairly entered it than I became aware it was much\r\nnarrower than I had supposed. To the left of us there was the long\r\nuninterrupted shoal, and to the right a high, steep bank heavily\r\novergrown with bushes. Above the bush the trees stood in serried ranks.\r\nThe twigs overhung the current thickly, and from distance to distance a\r\nlarge limb of some tree projected rigidly over the stream. It was then\r\nwell on in the afternoon, the face of the forest was gloomy, and a\r\nbroad strip of shadow had already fallen on the water. In this shadow\r\nwe steamed up--very slowly, as you may imagine. I sheered her well\r\ninshore--the water being deepest near the bank, as the sounding-pole\r\ninformed me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne of my hungry and forbearing friends was sounding in the bows just\r\nbelow me. This steamboat was exactly like a decked scow. On the deck,\r\nthere were two little teakwood houses, with doors and windows. The\r\nboiler was in the fore-end, and the machinery right astern. Over\r\nthe whole there was a light roof, supported on stanchions. The funnel\r\nprojected through that roof, and in front of the funnel a small cabin\r\nbuilt of light planks served for a pilot-house. It contained a couch,\r\ntwo camp-stools, a loaded Martini-Henry leaning in one corner, a tiny\r\ntable, and the steering-wheel. It had a wide door in front and a broad\r\nshutter at each side. All these were always thrown open, of course. I\r\nspent my days perched up there on the extreme fore-end of that roof,\r\nbefore the door. At night I slept, or tried to, on the couch. An\r\nathletic black belonging to some coast tribe and educated by my poor\r\npredecessor, was the helmsman. He sported a pair of brass earrings, wore\r\na blue cloth wrapper from the waist to the ankles, and thought all the\r\nworld of himself. He was the most unstable kind of fool I had ever seen.\r\nHe steered with no end of a swagger while you were by; but if he lost\r\nsight of you, he became instantly the prey of an abject funk, and would\r\nlet that cripple of a steamboat get the upper hand of him in a minute.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was looking down at the sounding-pole, and feeling much annoyed to\r\nsee at each try a little more of it stick out of that river, when I saw\r\nmy poleman give up on the business suddenly, and stretch himself flat on\r\nthe deck, without even taking the trouble to haul his pole in. He kept\r\nhold on it though, and it trailed in the water. At the same time the\r\nfireman, whom I could also see below me, sat down abruptly before his\r\nfurnace and ducked his head. I was amazed. Then I had to look at the\r\nriver mighty quick, because there was a snag in the fairway. Sticks,\r\nlittle sticks, were flying about--thick: they were whizzing before my\r\nnose, dropping below me, striking behind me against my pilot-house. All\r\nthis time the river, the shore, the woods, were very quiet--perfectly\r\nquiet. I could only hear the heavy splashing thump of the stern-wheel\r\nand the patter of these things. We cleared the snag clumsily. Arrows, by\r\nJove! We were being shot at! I stepped in quickly to close the shutter\r\non the landside. That fool-helmsman, his hands on the spokes, was\r\nlifting his knees high, stamping his feet, champing his mouth, like a\r\nreined-in horse. Confound him! And we were staggering within ten feet of\r\nthe bank. I had to lean right out to swing the heavy shutter, and I saw\r\na face amongst the leaves on the level with my own, looking at me very\r\nfierce and steady; and then suddenly, as though a veil had been removed\r\nfrom my eyes, I made out, deep in the tangled gloom, naked breasts,\r\narms, legs, glaring eyes--the bush was swarming with human limbs in\r\nmovement, glistening of bronze colour. The twigs shook, swayed, and\r\nrustled, the arrows flew out of them, and then the shutter came to.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Steer her straight,\xe2\x80\x99 I said to the helmsman. He held his head rigid,\r\nface forward; but his eyes rolled, he kept on lifting and setting down\r\nhis feet gently, his mouth foamed a little. \xe2\x80\x98Keep quiet!\xe2\x80\x99 I said in a\r\nfury. I might just as well have ordered a tree not to sway in the wind.\r\nI darted out. Below me there was a great scuffle of feet on the iron\r\ndeck; confused exclamations; a voice screamed, \xe2\x80\x98Can you turn back?\xe2\x80\x99\r\nI caught sight of a V-shaped ripple on the water ahead. What? Another\r\nsnag! A fusillade burst out under my feet. The pilgrims had opened with\r\ntheir Winchesters, and were simply squirting lead into that bush. A\r\ndeuce of a lot of smoke came up and drove slowly forward. I swore at\r\nit. Now I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t see the ripple or the snag either. I stood in the\r\ndoorway, peering, and the arrows came in swarms. They might have been\r\npoisoned, but they looked as though they wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t kill a cat. The bush\r\nbegan to howl. Our wood-cutters raised a warlike whoop; the report of a\r\nrifle just at my back deafened me. I glanced over my shoulder, and the\r\npilot-house was yet full of noise and smoke when I made a dash at the\r\nwheel. The fool-nigger had dropped everything, to throw the shutter\r\nopen and let off that Martini-Henry. He stood before the wide opening,\r\nglaring, and I yelled at him to come back, while I straightened the\r\nsudden twist out of that steamboat. There was no room to turn even if I\r\nhad wanted to, the snag was somewhere very near ahead in that confounded\r\nsmoke, there was no time to lose, so I just crowded her into the\r\nbank--right into the bank, where I knew the water was deep.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe tore slowly along the overhanging bushes in a whirl of broken twigs\r\nand flying leaves. The fusillade below stopped short, as I had foreseen\r\nit would when the squirts got empty. I threw my head back to a glinting\r\nwhizz that traversed the pilot-house, in at one shutter-hole and out\r\nat the other. Looking past that mad helmsman, who was shaking the empty\r\nrifle and yelling at the shore, I saw vague forms of men running bent\r\ndouble, leaping, gliding, distinct, incomplete, evanescent. Something\r\nbig appeared in the air before the shutter, the rifle went overboard,\r\nand the man stepped back swiftly, looked at me over his shoulder in an\r\nextraordinary, profound, familiar manner, and fell upon my feet. The\r\nside of his head hit the wheel twice, and the end of what appeared\r\na long cane clattered round and knocked over a little camp-stool. It\r\nlooked as though after wrenching that thing from somebody ashore he had\r\nlost his balance in the effort. The thin smoke had blown away, we were\r\nclear of the snag, and looking ahead I could see that in another hundred\r\nyards or so I would be free to sheer off, away from the bank; but my\r\nfeet felt so very warm and wet that I had to look down. The man had\r\nrolled on his back and stared straight up at me; both his hands clutched\r\nthat cane. It was the shaft of a spear that, either thrown or lunged\r\nthrough the opening, had caught him in the side, just below the ribs;\r\nthe blade had gone in out of sight, after making a frightful gash; my\r\nshoes were full; a pool of blood lay very still, gleaming dark-red under\r\nthe wheel; his eyes shone with an amazing lustre. The fusillade burst\r\nout again. He looked at me anxiously, gripping the spear like something\r\nprecious, with an air of being afraid I would try to take it away from\r\nhim. I had to make an effort to free my eyes from his gaze and attend\r\nto the steering. With one hand I felt above my head for the line of\r\nthe steam whistle, and jerked out screech after screech hurriedly. The\r\ntumult of angry and warlike yells was checked instantly, and then from\r\nthe depths of the woods went out such a tremulous and prolonged wail of\r\nmournful fear and utter despair as may be imagined to follow the flight\r\nof the last hope from the earth. There was a great commotion in the\r\nbush; the shower of arrows stopped, a few dropping shots rang out\r\nsharply--then silence, in which the languid beat of the stern-wheel came\r\nplainly to my ears. I put the helm hard a-starboard at the moment when\r\nthe pilgrim in pink pyjamas, very hot and agitated, appeared in the\r\ndoorway. \xe2\x80\x98The manager sends me--\xe2\x80\x99 he began in an official tone, and\r\nstopped short. \xe2\x80\x98Good God!\xe2\x80\x99 he said, glaring at the wounded man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe two whites stood over him, and his lustrous and inquiring glance\r\nenveloped us both. I declare it looked as though he would presently put\r\nto us some questions in an understandable language; but he died without\r\nuttering a sound, without moving a limb, without twitching a muscle.\r\nOnly in the very last moment, as though in response to some sign we\r\ncould not see, to some whisper we could not hear, he frowned heavily,\r\nand that frown gave to his black death-mask an inconceivably sombre,\r\nbrooding, and menacing expression. The lustre of inquiring glance faded\r\nswiftly into vacant glassiness. \xe2\x80\x98Can you steer?\xe2\x80\x99 I asked the agent\r\neagerly. He looked very dubious; but I made a grab at his arm, and he\r\nunderstood at once I meant him to steer whether or no. To tell you\r\nthe truth, I was morbidly anxious to change my shoes and socks. \xe2\x80\x98He is\r\ndead,\xe2\x80\x99 murmured the fellow, immensely impressed. \xe2\x80\x98No doubt about it,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsaid I, tugging like mad at the shoe-laces. \xe2\x80\x98And by the way, I suppose\r\nMr. Kurtz is dead as well by this time.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor the moment that was the dominant thought. There was a sense of\r\nextreme disappointment, as though I had found out I had been striving\r\nafter something altogether without a substance. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have been\r\nmore disgusted if I had travelled all this way for the sole purpose of\r\ntalking with Mr. Kurtz. Talking with... I flung one shoe overboard,\r\nand became aware that that was exactly what I had been looking forward\r\nto--a talk with Kurtz. I made the strange discovery that I had never\r\nimagined him as doing, you know, but as discoursing. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t say to\r\nmyself, \xe2\x80\x98Now I will never see him,\xe2\x80\x99 or \xe2\x80\x98Now I will never shake him by\r\nthe hand,\xe2\x80\x99 but, \xe2\x80\x98Now I will never hear him.\xe2\x80\x99 The man presented himself\r\nas a voice. Not of course that I did not connect him with some sort of\r\naction. Hadn\xe2\x80\x99t I been told in all the tones of jealousy and admiration\r\nthat he had collected, bartered, swindled, or stolen more ivory than all\r\nthe other agents together? That was not the point. The point was in his\r\nbeing a gifted creature, and that of all his gifts the one that stood\r\nout preeminently, that carried with it a sense of real presence, was his\r\nability to talk, his words--the gift of expression, the bewildering,\r\nthe illuminating, the most exalted and the most contemptible, the\r\npulsating stream of light, or the deceitful flow from the heart of an\r\nimpenetrable darkness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe other shoe went flying unto the devil-god of that river. I thought,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98By Jove! it\xe2\x80\x99s all over. We are too late; he has vanished--the gift has\r\nvanished, by means of some spear, arrow, or club. I will never hear that\r\nchap speak after all\xe2\x80\x99--and my sorrow had a startling extravagance of\r\nemotion, even such as I had noticed in the howling sorrow of these\r\nsavages in the bush. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have felt more of lonely desolation\r\nsomehow, had I been robbed of a belief or had missed my destiny in\r\nlife.... Why do you sigh in this beastly way, somebody? Absurd? Well,\r\nabsurd. Good Lord! mustn\xe2\x80\x99t a man ever--Here, give me some tobacco.\xe2\x80\x9d...\r\n\r\nThere was a pause of profound stillness, then a match flared, and\r\nMarlow\xe2\x80\x99s lean face appeared, worn, hollow, with downward folds and\r\ndropped eyelids, with an aspect of concentrated attention; and as he\r\ntook vigorous draws at his pipe, it seemed to retreat and advance out of\r\nthe night in the regular flicker of tiny flame. The match went out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAbsurd!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is the worst of trying to tell.... Here\r\nyou all are, each moored with two good addresses, like a hulk with\r\ntwo anchors, a butcher round one corner, a policeman round another,\r\nexcellent appetites, and temperature normal--you hear--normal from\r\nyear\xe2\x80\x99s end to year\xe2\x80\x99s end. And you say, Absurd! Absurd be--exploded!\r\nAbsurd! My dear boys, what can you expect from a man who out of sheer\r\nnervousness had just flung overboard a pair of new shoes! Now I think of\r\nit, it is amazing I did not shed tears. I am, upon the whole, proud\r\nof my fortitude. I was cut to the quick at the idea of having lost the\r\ninestimable privilege of listening to the gifted Kurtz. Of course I\r\nwas wrong. The privilege was waiting for me. Oh, yes, I heard more than\r\nenough. And I was right, too. A voice. He was very little more than a\r\nvoice. And I heard--him--it--this voice--other voices--all of them were\r\nso little more than voices--and the memory of that time itself lingers\r\naround me, impalpable, like a dying vibration of one immense jabber,\r\nsilly, atrocious, sordid, savage, or simply mean, without any kind of\r\nsense. Voices, voices--even the girl herself--now--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nHe was silent for a long time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI laid the ghost of his gifts at last with a lie,\xe2\x80\x9d he began, suddenly.\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cGirl! What? Did I mention a girl? Oh, she is out of it--completely.\r\nThey--the women, I mean--are out of it--should be out of it. We must\r\nhelp them to stay in that beautiful world of their own, lest ours\r\ngets worse. Oh, she had to be out of it. You should have heard the\r\ndisinterred body of Mr. Kurtz saying, \xe2\x80\x98My Intended.\xe2\x80\x99 You would have\r\nperceived directly then how completely she was out of it. And the lofty\r\nfrontal bone of Mr. Kurtz! They say the hair goes on growing sometimes,\r\nbut this--ah--specimen, was impressively bald. The wilderness had\r\npatted him on the head, and, behold, it was like a ball--an ivory ball;\r\nit had caressed him, and--lo!--he had withered; it had taken him, loved\r\nhim, embraced him, got into his veins, consumed his flesh, and sealed\r\nhis soul to its own by the inconceivable ceremonies of some devilish\r\ninitiation. He was its spoiled and pampered favourite. Ivory? I should\r\nthink so. Heaps of it, stacks of it. The old mud shanty was bursting\r\nwith it. You would think there was not a single tusk left either above\r\nor below the ground in the whole country. \xe2\x80\x98Mostly fossil,\xe2\x80\x99 the manager\r\nhad remarked, disparagingly. It was no more fossil than I am; but they\r\ncall it fossil when it is dug up. It appears these niggers do bury the\r\ntusks sometimes--but evidently they couldn\xe2\x80\x99t bury this parcel deep\r\nenough to save the gifted Mr. Kurtz from his fate. We filled the\r\nsteamboat with it, and had to pile a lot on the deck. Thus he could\r\nsee and enjoy as long as he could see, because the appreciation of this\r\nfavour had remained with him to the last. You should have heard him say,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98My ivory.\xe2\x80\x99 Oh, yes, I heard him. \xe2\x80\x98My Intended, my ivory, my station,\r\nmy river, my--\xe2\x80\x99 everything belonged to him. It made me hold my breath\r\nin expectation of hearing the wilderness burst into a prodigious peal\r\nof laughter that would shake the fixed stars in their places. Everything\r\nbelonged to him--but that was a trifle. The thing was to know what he\r\nbelonged to, how many powers of darkness claimed him for their own. That\r\nwas the reflection that made you creepy all over. It was impossible--it\r\nwas not good for one either--trying to imagine. He had taken a high seat\r\namongst the devils of the land--I mean literally. You can\xe2\x80\x99t understand.\r\nHow could you?--with solid pavement under your feet, surrounded by kind\r\nneighbours ready to cheer you or to fall on you, stepping delicately\r\nbetween the butcher and the policeman, in the holy terror of scandal and\r\ngallows and lunatic asylums--how can you imagine what particular region\r\nof the first ages a man\xe2\x80\x99s untrammelled feet may take him into by the\r\nway of solitude--utter solitude without a policeman--by the way of\r\nsilence--utter silence, where no warning voice of a kind neighbour can\r\nbe heard whispering of public opinion? These little things make all the\r\ngreat difference. When they are gone you must fall back upon your own\r\ninnate strength, upon your own capacity for faithfulness. Of course you\r\nmay be too much of a fool to go wrong--too dull even to know you are\r\nbeing assaulted by the powers of darkness. I take it, no fool ever made\r\na bargain for his soul with the devil; the fool is too much of a fool,\r\nor the devil too much of a devil--I don\xe2\x80\x99t know which. Or you may be such\r\na thunderingly exalted creature as to be altogether deaf and blind to\r\nanything but heavenly sights and sounds. Then the earth for you is only\r\na standing place--and whether to be like this is your loss or your gain\r\nI won\xe2\x80\x99t pretend to say. But most of us are neither one nor the other.\r\nThe earth for us is a place to live in, where we must put up with\r\nsights, with sounds, with smells, too, by Jove!--breathe dead hippo,\r\nso to speak, and not be contaminated. And there, don\xe2\x80\x99t you see?\r\nYour strength comes in, the faith in your ability for the digging of\r\nunostentatious holes to bury the stuff in--your power of devotion,\r\nnot to yourself, but to an obscure, back-breaking business. And that\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndifficult enough. Mind, I am not trying to excuse or even explain--I am\r\ntrying to account to myself for--for--Mr. Kurtz--for the shade of Mr.\r\nKurtz. This initiated wraith from the back of Nowhere honoured me with\r\nits amazing confidence before it vanished altogether. This was because\r\nit could speak English to me. The original Kurtz had been educated\r\npartly in England, and--as he was good enough to say himself--his\r\nsympathies were in the right place. His mother was half-English, his\r\nfather was half-French. All Europe contributed to the making of Kurtz;\r\nand by and by I learned that, most appropriately, the International\r\nSociety for the Suppression of Savage Customs had intrusted him with the\r\nmaking of a report, for its future guidance. And he had written it, too.\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve seen it. I\xe2\x80\x99ve read it. It was eloquent, vibrating with eloquence,\r\nbut too high-strung, I think. Seventeen pages of close writing he had\r\nfound time for! But this must have been before his--let us say--nerves,\r\nwent wrong, and caused him to preside at certain midnight dances ending\r\nwith unspeakable rites, which--as far as I reluctantly gathered\r\nfrom what I heard at various times--were offered up to him--do you\r\nunderstand?--to Mr. Kurtz himself. But it was a beautiful piece\r\nof writing. The opening paragraph, however, in the light of later\r\ninformation, strikes me now as ominous. He began with the argument\r\nthat we whites, from the point of development we had arrived at, \xe2\x80\x98must\r\nnecessarily appear to them [savages] in the nature of supernatural\r\nbeings--we approach them with the might of a deity,\xe2\x80\x99 and so on, and so\r\non. \xe2\x80\x98By the simple exercise of our will we can exert a power for good\r\npractically unbounded,\xe2\x80\x99 etc., etc. From that point he soared and took me\r\nwith him. The peroration was magnificent, though difficult to remember,\r\nyou know. It gave me the notion of an exotic Immensity ruled by an\r\naugust Benevolence. It made me tingle with enthusiasm. This was the\r\nunbounded power of eloquence--of words--of burning noble words. There\r\nwere no practical hints to interrupt the magic current of phrases,\r\nunless a kind of note at the foot of the last page, scrawled evidently\r\nmuch later, in an unsteady hand, may be regarded as the exposition of\r\na method. It was very simple, and at the end of that moving appeal to\r\nevery altruistic sentiment it blazed at you, luminous and terrifying,\r\nlike a flash of lightning in a serene sky: \xe2\x80\x98Exterminate all the brutes!\xe2\x80\x99\r\nThe curious part was that he had apparently forgotten all about that\r\nvaluable postscriptum, because, later on, when he in a sense came to\r\nhimself, he repeatedly entreated me to take good care of \xe2\x80\x98my pamphlet\xe2\x80\x99\r\n(he called it), as it was sure to have in the future a good influence\r\nupon his career. I had full information about all these things, and,\r\nbesides, as it turned out, I was to have the care of his memory. I\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\ndone enough for it to give me the indisputable right to lay it, if I\r\nchoose, for an everlasting rest in the dust-bin of progress, amongst\r\nall the sweepings and, figuratively speaking, all the dead cats of\r\ncivilization. But then, you see, I can\xe2\x80\x99t choose. He won\xe2\x80\x99t be forgotten.\r\nWhatever he was, he was not common. He had the power to charm or\r\nfrighten rudimentary souls into an aggravated witch-dance in his\r\nhonour; he could also fill the small souls of the pilgrims with bitter\r\nmisgivings: he had one devoted friend at least, and he had conquered\r\none soul in the world that was neither rudimentary nor tainted with\r\nself-seeking. No; I can\xe2\x80\x99t forget him, though I am not prepared to affirm\r\nthe fellow was exactly worth the life we lost in getting to him. I\r\nmissed my late helmsman awfully--I missed him even while his body\r\nwas still lying in the pilot-house. Perhaps you will think it passing\r\nstrange this regret for a savage who was no more account than a grain of\r\nsand in a black Sahara. Well, don\xe2\x80\x99t you see, he had done something, he\r\nhad steered; for months I had him at my back--a help--an instrument. It\r\nwas a kind of partnership. He steered for me--I had to look after him, I\r\nworried about his deficiencies, and thus a subtle bond had been created,\r\nof which I only became aware when it was suddenly broken. And the\r\nintimate profundity of that look he gave me when he received his hurt\r\nremains to this day in my memory--like a claim of distant kinship\r\naffirmed in a supreme moment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cPoor fool! If he had only left that shutter alone. He had no restraint,\r\nno restraint--just like Kurtz--a tree swayed by the wind. As soon as\r\nI had put on a dry pair of slippers, I dragged him out, after first\r\njerking the spear out of his side, which operation I confess I performed\r\nwith my eyes shut tight. His heels leaped together over the little\r\ndoorstep; his shoulders were pressed to my breast; I hugged him from\r\nbehind desperately. Oh! he was heavy, heavy; heavier than any man on\r\nearth, I should imagine. Then without more ado I tipped him overboard.\r\nThe current snatched him as though he had been a wisp of grass, and I\r\nsaw the body roll over twice before I lost sight of it for ever. All the\r\npilgrims and the manager were then congregated on the awning-deck\r\nabout the pilot-house, chattering at each other like a flock of excited\r\nmagpies, and there was a scandalized murmur at my heartless promptitude.\r\nWhat they wanted to keep that body hanging about for I can\xe2\x80\x99t guess.\r\nEmbalm it, maybe. But I had also heard another, and a very ominous,\r\nmurmur on the deck below. My friends the wood-cutters were likewise\r\nscandalized, and with a better show of reason--though I admit that the\r\nreason itself was quite inadmissible. Oh, quite! I had made up my mind\r\nthat if my late helmsman was to be eaten, the fishes alone should have\r\nhim. He had been a very second-rate helmsman while alive, but now he was\r\ndead he might have become a first-class temptation, and possibly cause\r\nsome startling trouble. Besides, I was anxious to take the wheel, the\r\nman in pink pyjamas showing himself a hopeless duffer at the business.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis I did directly the simple funeral was over. We were going\r\nhalf-speed, keeping right in the middle of the stream, and I listened\r\nto the talk about me. They had given up Kurtz, they had given up the\r\nstation; Kurtz was dead, and the station had been burnt--and so on--and\r\nso on. The red-haired pilgrim was beside himself with the thought that\r\nat least this poor Kurtz had been properly avenged. \xe2\x80\x98Say! We must have\r\nmade a glorious slaughter of them in the bush. Eh? What do you think?\r\nSay?\xe2\x80\x99 He positively danced, the bloodthirsty little gingery beggar.\r\nAnd he had nearly fainted when he saw the wounded man! I could not help\r\nsaying, \xe2\x80\x98You made a glorious lot of smoke, anyhow.\xe2\x80\x99 I had seen, from the\r\nway the tops of the bushes rustled and flew, that almost all the shots\r\nhad gone too high. You can\xe2\x80\x99t hit anything unless you take aim and fire\r\nfrom the shoulder; but these chaps fired from the hip with their eyes\r\nshut. The retreat, I maintained--and I was right--was caused by the\r\nscreeching of the steam whistle. Upon this they forgot Kurtz, and began\r\nto howl at me with indignant protests.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe manager stood by the wheel murmuring confidentially about the\r\nnecessity of getting well away down the river before dark at all events,\r\nwhen I saw in the distance a clearing on the riverside and the outlines\r\nof some sort of building. \xe2\x80\x98What\xe2\x80\x99s this?\xe2\x80\x99 I asked. He clapped his hands\r\nin wonder. \xe2\x80\x98The station!\xe2\x80\x99 he cried. I edged in at once, still going\r\nhalf-speed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThrough my glasses I saw the slope of a hill interspersed with rare\r\ntrees and perfectly free from undergrowth. A long decaying building on\r\nthe summit was half buried in the high grass; the large holes in the\r\npeaked roof gaped black from afar; the jungle and the woods made a\r\nbackground. There was no enclosure or fence of any kind; but there had\r\nbeen one apparently, for near the house half-a-dozen slim posts remained\r\nin a row, roughly trimmed, and with their upper ends ornamented with\r\nround carved balls. The rails, or whatever there had been between, had\r\ndisappeared. Of course the forest surrounded all that. The river-bank\r\nwas clear, and on the waterside I saw a white man under a hat like a\r\ncart-wheel beckoning persistently with his whole arm. Examining the\r\nedge of the forest above and below, I was almost certain I could see\r\nmovements--human forms gliding here and there. I steamed past prudently,\r\nthen stopped the engines and let her drift down. The man on the shore\r\nbegan to shout, urging us to land. \xe2\x80\x98We have been attacked,\xe2\x80\x99 screamed\r\nthe manager. \xe2\x80\x98I know--I know. It\xe2\x80\x99s all right,\xe2\x80\x99 yelled back the other, as\r\ncheerful as you please. \xe2\x80\x98Come along. It\xe2\x80\x99s all right. I am glad.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHis aspect reminded me of something I had seen--something funny I had\r\nseen somewhere. As I manoeuvred to get alongside, I was asking myself,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What does this fellow look like?\xe2\x80\x99 Suddenly I got it. He looked like\r\na harlequin. His clothes had been made of some stuff that was brown\r\nholland probably, but it was covered with patches all over, with bright\r\npatches, blue, red, and yellow--patches on the back, patches on the\r\nfront, patches on elbows, on knees; coloured binding around his jacket,\r\nscarlet edging at the bottom of his trousers; and the sunshine made him\r\nlook extremely gay and wonderfully neat withal, because you could see\r\nhow beautifully all this patching had been done. A beardless, boyish\r\nface, very fair, no features to speak of, nose peeling, little blue\r\neyes, smiles and frowns chasing each other over that open countenance\r\nlike sunshine and shadow on a wind-swept plain. \xe2\x80\x98Look out, captain!\xe2\x80\x99 he\r\ncried; \xe2\x80\x98there\xe2\x80\x99s a snag lodged in here last night.\xe2\x80\x99 What! Another snag? I\r\nconfess I swore shamefully. I had nearly holed my cripple, to finish off\r\nthat charming trip. The harlequin on the bank turned his little pug-nose\r\nup to me. \xe2\x80\x98You English?\xe2\x80\x99 he asked, all smiles. \xe2\x80\x98Are you?\xe2\x80\x99 I shouted from\r\nthe wheel. The smiles vanished, and he shook his head as if sorry for\r\nmy disappointment. Then he brightened up. \xe2\x80\x98Never mind!\xe2\x80\x99 he cried\r\nencouragingly. \xe2\x80\x98Are we in time?\xe2\x80\x99 I asked. \xe2\x80\x98He is up there,\xe2\x80\x99 he replied,\r\nwith a toss of the head up the hill, and becoming gloomy all of a\r\nsudden. His face was like the autumn sky, overcast one moment and bright\r\nthe next.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen the manager, escorted by the pilgrims, all of them armed to the\r\nteeth, had gone to the house this chap came on board. \xe2\x80\x98I say, I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nlike this. These natives are in the bush,\xe2\x80\x99 I said. He assured me\r\nearnestly it was all right. \xe2\x80\x98They are simple people,\xe2\x80\x99 he added; \xe2\x80\x98well,\r\nI am glad you came. It took me all my time to keep them off.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98But you\r\nsaid it was all right,\xe2\x80\x99 I cried. \xe2\x80\x98Oh, they meant no harm,\xe2\x80\x99 he said; and\r\nas I stared he corrected himself, \xe2\x80\x98Not exactly.\xe2\x80\x99 Then vivaciously, \xe2\x80\x98My\r\nfaith, your pilot-house wants a clean-up!\xe2\x80\x99 In the next breath he advised\r\nme to keep enough steam on the boiler to blow the whistle in case of any\r\ntrouble. \xe2\x80\x98One good screech will do more for you than all your rifles.\r\nThey are simple people,\xe2\x80\x99 he repeated. He rattled away at such a rate\r\nhe quite overwhelmed me. He seemed to be trying to make up for lots of\r\nsilence, and actually hinted, laughing, that such was the case. \xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nyou talk with Mr. Kurtz?\xe2\x80\x99 I said. \xe2\x80\x98You don\xe2\x80\x99t talk with that man--you\r\nlisten to him,\xe2\x80\x99 he exclaimed with severe exaltation. \xe2\x80\x98But now--\xe2\x80\x99 He\r\nwaved his arm, and in the twinkling of an eye was in the uttermost\r\ndepths of despondency. In a moment he came up again with a jump,\r\npossessed himself of both my hands, shook them continuously, while he\r\ngabbled: \xe2\x80\x98Brother sailor... honour... pleasure... delight...\r\nintroduce myself... Russian... son of an arch-priest...\r\nGovernment of Tambov... What? Tobacco! English tobacco; the excellent\r\nEnglish tobacco! Now, that\xe2\x80\x99s brotherly. Smoke? Where\xe2\x80\x99s a sailor that\r\ndoes not smoke?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe pipe soothed him, and gradually I made out he had run away from\r\nschool, had gone to sea in a Russian ship; ran away again; served some\r\ntime in English ships; was now reconciled with the arch-priest. He made\r\na point of that. \xe2\x80\x98But when one is young one must see things, gather\r\nexperience, ideas; enlarge the mind.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Here!\xe2\x80\x99 I interrupted. \xe2\x80\x98You\r\ncan never tell! Here I met Mr. Kurtz,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, youthfully solemn and\r\nreproachful. I held my tongue after that. It appears he had persuaded a\r\nDutch trading-house on the coast to fit him out with stores and goods,\r\nand had started for the interior with a light heart and no more idea of\r\nwhat would happen to him than a baby. He had been wandering about that\r\nriver for nearly two years alone, cut off from everybody and everything.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am not so young as I look. I am twenty-five,\xe2\x80\x99 he said. \xe2\x80\x98At first old\r\nVan Shuyten would tell me to go to the devil,\xe2\x80\x99 he narrated with keen\r\nenjoyment; \xe2\x80\x98but I stuck to him, and talked and talked, till at last he\r\ngot afraid I would talk the hind-leg off his favourite dog, so he gave\r\nme some cheap things and a few guns, and told me he hoped he would never\r\nsee my face again. Good old Dutchman, Van Shuyten. I\xe2\x80\x99ve sent him one\r\nsmall lot of ivory a year ago, so that he can\xe2\x80\x99t call me a little thief\r\nwhen I get back. I hope he got it. And for the rest I don\xe2\x80\x99t care. I had\r\nsome wood stacked for you. That was my old house. Did you see?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI gave him Towson\xe2\x80\x99s book. He made as though he would kiss me, but\r\nrestrained himself. \xe2\x80\x98The only book I had left, and I thought I had lost\r\nit,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, looking at it ecstatically. \xe2\x80\x98So many accidents happen to\r\na man going about alone, you know. Canoes get upset sometimes--and\r\nsometimes you\xe2\x80\x99ve got to clear out so quick when the people get angry.\xe2\x80\x99\r\nHe thumbed the pages. \xe2\x80\x98You made notes in Russian?\xe2\x80\x99 I asked. He nodded.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I thought they were written in cipher,\xe2\x80\x99 I said. He laughed, then became\r\nserious. \xe2\x80\x98I had lots of trouble to keep these people off,\xe2\x80\x99 he said.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Did they want to kill you?\xe2\x80\x99 I asked. \xe2\x80\x98Oh, no!\xe2\x80\x99 he cried, and checked\r\nhimself. \xe2\x80\x98Why did they attack us?\xe2\x80\x99 I pursued. He hesitated, then\r\nsaid shamefacedly, \xe2\x80\x98They don\xe2\x80\x99t want him to go.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t they?\xe2\x80\x99 I said\r\ncuriously. He nodded a nod full of mystery and wisdom. \xe2\x80\x98I tell you,\xe2\x80\x99 he\r\ncried, \xe2\x80\x98this man has enlarged my mind.\xe2\x80\x99 He opened his arms wide, staring\r\nat me with his little blue eyes that were perfectly round.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI looked at him, lost in astonishment. There he was before me, in\r\nmotley, as though he had absconded from a troupe of mimes, enthusiastic,\r\nfabulous. His very existence was improbable, inexplicable, and\r\naltogether bewildering. He was an insoluble problem. It was\r\ninconceivable how he had existed, how he had succeeded in getting so\r\nfar, how he had managed to remain--why he did not instantly disappear.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I went a little farther,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, \xe2\x80\x98then still a little farther--till\r\nI had gone so far that I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how I\xe2\x80\x99ll ever get back. Never mind.\r\nPlenty time. I can manage. You take Kurtz away quick--quick--I tell\r\nyou.\xe2\x80\x99 The glamour of youth enveloped his parti-coloured rags, his\r\ndestitution, his loneliness, the essential desolation of his futile\r\nwanderings. For months--for years--his life hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been worth a day\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npurchase; and there he was gallantly, thoughtlessly alive, to all\r\nappearances indestructible solely by the virtue of his few years and\r\nof his unreflecting audacity. I was seduced into something like\r\nadmiration--like envy. Glamour urged him on, glamour kept him\r\nunscathed. He surely wanted nothing from the wilderness but space to\r\nbreathe in and to push on through. His need was to exist, and to move\r\nonwards at the greatest possible risk, and with a maximum of privation.\r\nIf the absolutely pure, uncalculating, unpractical spirit of adventure\r\nhad ever ruled a human being, it ruled this bepatched youth. I almost\r\nenvied him the possession of this modest and clear flame. It seemed to\r\nhave consumed all thought of self so completely, that even while he\r\nwas talking to you, you forgot that it was he--the man before your\r\neyes--who had gone through these things. I did not envy him his devotion\r\nto Kurtz, though. He had not meditated over it. It came to him, and\r\nhe accepted it with a sort of eager fatalism. I must say that to me it\r\nappeared about the most dangerous thing in every way he had come upon so\r\nfar.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey had come together unavoidably, like two ships becalmed near\r\neach other, and lay rubbing sides at last. I suppose Kurtz wanted an\r\naudience, because on a certain occasion, when encamped in the forest,\r\nthey had talked all night, or more probably Kurtz had talked. \xe2\x80\x98We talked\r\nof everything,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, quite transported at the recollection. \xe2\x80\x98I\r\nforgot there was such a thing as sleep. The night did not seem to last\r\nan hour. Everything! Everything!... Of love, too.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Ah, he talked to\r\nyou of love!\xe2\x80\x99 I said, much amused. \xe2\x80\x98It isn\xe2\x80\x99t what you think,\xe2\x80\x99 he cried,\r\nalmost passionately. \xe2\x80\x98It was in general. He made me see things--things.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe threw his arms up. We were on deck at the time, and the headman\r\nof my wood-cutters, lounging near by, turned upon him his heavy and\r\nglittering eyes. I looked around, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t know why, but I assure you\r\nthat never, never before, did this land, this river, this jungle, the\r\nvery arch of this blazing sky, appear to me so hopeless and so dark, so\r\nimpenetrable to human thought, so pitiless to human weakness. \xe2\x80\x98And, ever\r\nsince, you have been with him, of course?\xe2\x80\x99 I said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn the contrary. It appears their intercourse had been very much broken\r\nby various causes. He had, as he informed me proudly, managed to nurse\r\nKurtz through two illnesses (he alluded to it as you would to some risky\r\nfeat), but as a rule Kurtz wandered alone, far in the depths of the\r\nforest. \xe2\x80\x98Very often coming to this station, I had to wait days and\r\ndays before he would turn up,\xe2\x80\x99 he said. \xe2\x80\x98Ah, it was worth waiting\r\nfor!--sometimes.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98What was he doing? exploring or what?\xe2\x80\x99 I asked. \xe2\x80\x98Oh,\r\nyes, of course\xe2\x80\x99; he had discovered lots of villages, a lake, too--he\r\ndid not know exactly in what direction; it was dangerous to inquire\r\ntoo much--but mostly his expeditions had been for ivory. \xe2\x80\x98But he had no\r\ngoods to trade with by that time,\xe2\x80\x99 I objected. \xe2\x80\x98There\xe2\x80\x99s a good lot of\r\ncartridges left even yet,\xe2\x80\x99 he answered, looking away. \xe2\x80\x98To speak plainly,\r\nhe raided the country,\xe2\x80\x99 I said. He nodded. \xe2\x80\x98Not alone, surely!\xe2\x80\x99 He\r\nmuttered something about the villages round that lake. \xe2\x80\x98Kurtz got the\r\ntribe to follow him, did he?\xe2\x80\x99 I suggested. He fidgeted a little. \xe2\x80\x98They\r\nadored him,\xe2\x80\x99 he said. The tone of these words was so extraordinary that\r\nI looked at him searchingly. It was curious to see his mingled eagerness\r\nand reluctance to speak of Kurtz. The man filled his life, occupied his\r\nthoughts, swayed his emotions. \xe2\x80\x98What can you expect?\xe2\x80\x99 he burst out; \xe2\x80\x98he\r\ncame to them with thunder and lightning, you know--and they had never\r\nseen anything like it--and very terrible. He could be very terrible.\r\nYou can\xe2\x80\x99t judge Mr. Kurtz as you would an ordinary man. No, no, no!\r\nNow--just to give you an idea--I don\xe2\x80\x99t mind telling you, he wanted to\r\nshoot me, too, one day--but I don\xe2\x80\x99t judge him.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Shoot you!\xe2\x80\x99 I cried\r\n\xe2\x80\x98What for?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Well, I had a small lot of ivory the chief of that village\r\nnear my house gave me. You see I used to shoot game for them. Well,\r\nhe wanted it, and wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t hear reason. He declared he would shoot me\r\nunless I gave him the ivory and then cleared out of the country, because\r\nhe could do so, and had a fancy for it, and there was nothing on earth\r\nto prevent him killing whom he jolly well pleased. And it was true, too.\r\nI gave him the ivory. What did I care! But I didn\xe2\x80\x99t clear out. No, no. I\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t leave him. I had to be careful, of course, till we got friendly\r\nagain for a time. He had his second illness then. Afterwards I had to\r\nkeep out of the way; but I didn\xe2\x80\x99t mind. He was living for the most part\r\nin those villages on the lake. When he came down to the river, sometimes\r\nhe would take to me, and sometimes it was better for me to be careful.\r\nThis man suffered too much. He hated all this, and somehow he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nget away. When I had a chance I begged him to try and leave while there\r\nwas time; I offered to go back with him. And he would say yes, and then\r\nhe would remain; go off on another ivory hunt; disappear for weeks;\r\nforget himself amongst these people--forget himself--you know.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Why!\r\nhe\xe2\x80\x99s mad,\xe2\x80\x99 I said. He protested indignantly. Mr. Kurtz couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be mad.\r\nIf I had heard him talk, only two days ago, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t dare hint at such\r\na thing.... I had taken up my binoculars while we talked, and was\r\nlooking at the shore, sweeping the limit of the forest at each side and\r\nat the back of the house. The consciousness of there being people in\r\nthat bush, so silent, so quiet--as silent and quiet as the ruined house\r\non the hill--made me uneasy. There was no sign on the face of nature\r\nof this amazing tale that was not so much told as suggested to me in\r\ndesolate exclamations, completed by shrugs, in interrupted phrases, in\r\nhints ending in deep sighs. The woods were unmoved, like a mask--heavy,\r\nlike the closed door of a prison--they looked with their air of hidden\r\nknowledge, of patient expectation, of unapproachable silence. The\r\nRussian was explaining to me that it was only lately that Mr. Kurtz had\r\ncome down to the river, bringing along with him all the fighting men of\r\nthat lake tribe. He had been absent for several months--getting himself\r\nadored, I suppose--and had come down unexpectedly, with the intention\r\nto all appearance of making a raid either across the river or down\r\nstream. Evidently the appetite for more ivory had got the better of\r\nthe--what shall I say?--less material aspirations. However he had\r\ngot much worse suddenly. \xe2\x80\x98I heard he was lying helpless, and so I came\r\nup--took my chance,\xe2\x80\x99 said the Russian. \xe2\x80\x98Oh, he is bad, very bad.\xe2\x80\x99 I\r\ndirected my glass to the house. There were no signs of life, but there\r\nwas the ruined roof, the long mud wall peeping above the grass, with\r\nthree little square window-holes, no two of the same size; all this\r\nbrought within reach of my hand, as it were. And then I made a brusque\r\nmovement, and one of the remaining posts of that vanished fence leaped\r\nup in the field of my glass. You remember I told you I had been struck\r\nat the distance by certain attempts at ornamentation, rather remarkable\r\nin the ruinous aspect of the place. Now I had suddenly a nearer view,\r\nand its first result was to make me throw my head back as if before a\r\nblow. Then I went carefully from post to post with my glass, and I saw\r\nmy mistake. These round knobs were not ornamental but symbolic; they\r\nwere expressive and puzzling, striking and disturbing--food for thought\r\nand also for vultures if there had been any looking down from the sky;\r\nbut at all events for such ants as were industrious enough to ascend\r\nthe pole. They would have been even more impressive, those heads on the\r\nstakes, if their faces had not been turned to the house. Only one, the\r\nfirst I had made out, was facing my way. I was not so shocked as you may\r\nthink. The start back I had given was really nothing but a movement\r\nof surprise. I had expected to see a knob of wood there, you know. I\r\nreturned deliberately to the first I had seen--and there it was, black,\r\ndried, sunken, with closed eyelids--a head that seemed to sleep at the\r\ntop of that pole, and, with the shrunken dry lips showing a narrow\r\nwhite line of the teeth, was smiling, too, smiling continuously at some\r\nendless and jocose dream of that eternal slumber.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI am not disclosing any trade secrets. In fact, the manager said\r\nafterwards that Mr. Kurtz\xe2\x80\x99s methods had ruined the district. I have no\r\nopinion on that point, but I want you clearly to understand that there\r\nwas nothing exactly profitable in these heads being there. They only\r\nshowed that Mr. Kurtz lacked restraint in the gratification of his\r\nvarious lusts, that there was something wanting in him--some small\r\nmatter which, when the pressing need arose, could not be found under\r\nhis magnificent eloquence. Whether he knew of this deficiency himself I\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t say. I think the knowledge came to him at last--only at the very\r\nlast. But the wilderness had found him out early, and had taken on him a\r\nterrible vengeance for the fantastic invasion. I think it had whispered\r\nto him things about himself which he did not know, things of which he\r\nhad no conception till he took counsel with this great solitude--and the\r\nwhisper had proved irresistibly fascinating. It echoed loudly within him\r\nbecause he was hollow at the core.... I put down the glass, and the\r\nhead that had appeared near enough to be spoken to seemed at once to\r\nhave leaped away from me into inaccessible distance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe admirer of Mr. Kurtz was a bit crestfallen. In a hurried,\r\nindistinct voice he began to assure me he had not dared to take\r\nthese--say, symbols--down. He was not afraid of the natives; they would\r\nnot stir till Mr. Kurtz gave the word. His ascendancy was extraordinary.\r\nThe camps of these people surrounded the place, and the chiefs came\r\nevery day to see him. They would crawl.... \xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to know\r\nanything of the ceremonies used when approaching Mr. Kurtz,\xe2\x80\x99 I shouted.\r\nCurious, this feeling that came over me that such details would be more\r\nintolerable than those heads drying on the stakes under Mr. Kurtz\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwindows. After all, that was only a savage sight, while I seemed at\r\none bound to have been transported into some lightless region of subtle\r\nhorrors, where pure, uncomplicated savagery was a positive relief, being\r\nsomething that had a right to exist--obviously--in the sunshine. The\r\nyoung man looked at me with surprise. I suppose it did not occur to\r\nhim that Mr. Kurtz was no idol of mine. He forgot I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t heard any of\r\nthese splendid monologues on, what was it? on love, justice, conduct\r\nof life--or what not. If it had come to crawling before Mr. Kurtz, he\r\ncrawled as much as the veriest savage of them all. I had no idea of the\r\nconditions, he said: these heads were the heads of rebels. I shocked him\r\nexcessively by laughing. Rebels! What would be the next definition I\r\nwas to hear? There had been enemies, criminals, workers--and these\r\nwere rebels. Those rebellious heads looked very subdued to me on their\r\nsticks. \xe2\x80\x98You don\xe2\x80\x99t know how such a life tries a man like Kurtz,\xe2\x80\x99 cried\r\nKurtz\xe2\x80\x99s last disciple. \xe2\x80\x98Well, and you?\xe2\x80\x99 I said. \xe2\x80\x98I! I! I am a simple\r\nman. I have no great thoughts. I want nothing from anybody. How can\r\nyou compare me to...?\xe2\x80\x99 His feelings were too much for speech, and\r\nsuddenly he broke down. \xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand,\xe2\x80\x99 he groaned. \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ve been\r\ndoing my best to keep him alive, and that\xe2\x80\x99s enough. I had no hand in\r\nall this. I have no abilities. There hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been a drop of medicine or a\r\nmouthful of invalid food for months here. He was shamefully abandoned.\r\nA man like this, with such ideas. Shamefully! Shamefully! I--I--haven\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nslept for the last ten nights...\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHis voice lost itself in the calm of the evening. The long shadows of\r\nthe forest had slipped downhill while we talked, had gone far beyond\r\nthe ruined hovel, beyond the symbolic row of stakes. All this was in the\r\ngloom, while we down there were yet in the sunshine, and the stretch\r\nof the river abreast of the clearing glittered in a still and dazzling\r\nsplendour, with a murky and overshadowed bend above and below. Not a\r\nliving soul was seen on the shore. The bushes did not rustle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSuddenly round the corner of the house a group of men appeared, as\r\nthough they had come up from the ground. They waded waist-deep in the\r\ngrass, in a compact body, bearing an improvised stretcher in their\r\nmidst. Instantly, in the emptiness of the landscape, a cry arose whose\r\nshrillness pierced the still air like a sharp arrow flying straight to\r\nthe very heart of the land; and, as if by enchantment, streams of human\r\nbeings--of naked human beings--with spears in their hands, with bows,\r\nwith shields, with wild glances and savage movements, were poured into\r\nthe clearing by the dark-faced and pensive forest. The bushes shook, the\r\ngrass swayed for a time, and then everything stood still in attentive\r\nimmobility.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Now, if he does not say the right thing to them we are all done for,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsaid the Russian at my elbow. The knot of men with the stretcher had\r\nstopped, too, halfway to the steamer, as if petrified. I saw the man on\r\nthe stretcher sit up, lank and with an uplifted arm, above the shoulders\r\nof the bearers. \xe2\x80\x98Let us hope that the man who can talk so well of love\r\nin general will find some particular reason to spare us this time,\xe2\x80\x99 I\r\nsaid. I resented bitterly the absurd danger of our situation, as if\r\nto be at the mercy of that atrocious phantom had been a dishonouring\r\nnecessity. I could not hear a sound, but through my glasses I saw the\r\nthin arm extended commandingly, the lower jaw moving, the eyes of\r\nthat apparition shining darkly far in its bony head that nodded with\r\ngrotesque jerks. Kurtz--Kurtz--that means short in German--don\xe2\x80\x99t it?\r\nWell, the name was as true as everything else in his life--and death.\r\nHe looked at least seven feet long. His covering had fallen off, and his\r\nbody emerged from it pitiful and appalling as from a winding-sheet. I\r\ncould see the cage of his ribs all astir, the bones of his arm waving.\r\nIt was as though an animated image of death carved out of old ivory had\r\nbeen shaking its hand with menaces at a motionless crowd of men made of\r\ndark and glittering bronze. I saw him open his mouth wide--it gave him\r\na weirdly voracious aspect, as though he had wanted to swallow all the\r\nair, all the earth, all the men before him. A deep voice reached\r\nme faintly. He must have been shouting. He fell back suddenly. The\r\nstretcher shook as the bearers staggered forward again, and almost at\r\nthe same time I noticed that the crowd of savages was vanishing without\r\nany perceptible movement of retreat, as if the forest that had ejected\r\nthese beings so suddenly had drawn them in again as the breath is drawn\r\nin a long aspiration.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSome of the pilgrims behind the stretcher carried his\r\narms--two shot-guns, a heavy rifle, and a light revolver-carbine--the\r\nthunderbolts of that pitiful Jupiter. The manager bent over him\r\nmurmuring as he walked beside his head. They laid him down in one of the\r\nlittle cabins--just a room for a bed place and a camp-stool or two,\r\nyou know. We had brought his belated correspondence, and a lot of torn\r\nenvelopes and open letters littered his bed. His hand roamed feebly\r\namongst these papers. I was struck by the fire of his eyes and the\r\ncomposed languor of his expression. It was not so much the exhaustion of\r\ndisease. He did not seem in pain. This shadow looked satiated and calm,\r\nas though for the moment it had had its fill of all the emotions.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe rustled one of the letters, and looking straight in my face said,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I am glad.\xe2\x80\x99 Somebody had been writing to him about me. These special\r\nrecommendations were turning up again. The volume of tone he emitted\r\nwithout effort, almost without the trouble of moving his lips, amazed\r\nme. A voice! a voice! It was grave, profound, vibrating, while the man\r\ndid not seem capable of a whisper. However, he had enough strength in\r\nhim--factitious no doubt--to very nearly make an end of us, as you\r\nshall hear directly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe manager appeared silently in the doorway; I stepped out at once\r\nand he drew the curtain after me. The Russian, eyed curiously by the\r\npilgrims, was staring at the shore. I followed the direction of his\r\nglance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cDark human shapes could be made out in the distance, flitting\r\nindistinctly against the gloomy border of the forest, and near the river\r\ntwo bronze figures, leaning on tall spears, stood in the sunlight under\r\nfantastic head-dresses of spotted skins, warlike and still in statuesque\r\nrepose. And from right to left along the lighted shore moved a wild and\r\ngorgeous apparition of a woman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe walked with measured steps, draped in striped and fringed cloths,\r\ntreading the earth proudly, with a slight jingle and flash of barbarous\r\nornaments. She carried her head high; her hair was done in the shape of\r\na helmet; she had brass leggings to the knee, brass wire gauntlets to\r\nthe elbow, a crimson spot on her tawny cheek, innumerable necklaces of\r\nglass beads on her neck; bizarre things, charms, gifts of witch-men,\r\nthat hung about her, glittered and trembled at every step. She must have\r\nhad the value of several elephant tusks upon her. She was savage and\r\nsuperb, wild-eyed and magnificent; there was something ominous and\r\nstately in her deliberate progress. And in the hush that had fallen\r\nsuddenly upon the whole sorrowful land, the immense wilderness, the\r\ncolossal body of the fecund and mysterious life seemed to look at her,\r\npensive, as though it had been looking at the image of its own tenebrous\r\nand passionate soul.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe came abreast of the steamer, stood still, and faced us. Her long\r\nshadow fell to the water\xe2\x80\x99s edge. Her face had a tragic and fierce\r\naspect of wild sorrow and of dumb pain mingled with the fear of some\r\nstruggling, half-shaped resolve. She stood looking at us without a\r\nstir, and like the wilderness itself, with an air of brooding over an\r\ninscrutable purpose. A whole minute passed, and then she made a step\r\nforward. There was a low jingle, a glint of yellow metal, a sway of\r\nfringed draperies, and she stopped as if her heart had failed her. The\r\nyoung fellow by my side growled. The pilgrims murmured at my back.\r\nShe looked at us all as if her life had depended upon the unswerving\r\nsteadiness of her glance. Suddenly she opened her bared arms and threw\r\nthem up rigid above her head, as though in an uncontrollable desire to\r\ntouch the sky, and at the same time the swift shadows darted out on the\r\nearth, swept around on the river, gathering the steamer into a shadowy\r\nembrace. A formidable silence hung over the scene.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe turned away slowly, walked on, following the bank, and passed into\r\nthe bushes to the left. Once only her eyes gleamed back at us in the\r\ndusk of the thickets before she disappeared.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98If she had offered to come aboard I really think I would have tried to\r\nshoot her,\xe2\x80\x99 said the man of patches, nervously. \xe2\x80\x98I have been risking my\r\nlife every day for the last fortnight to keep her out of the house. She\r\ngot in one day and kicked up a row about those miserable rags I picked\r\nup in the storeroom to mend my clothes with. I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t decent. At least\r\nit must have been that, for she talked like a fury to Kurtz for an hour,\r\npointing at me now and then. I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand the dialect of this\r\ntribe. Luckily for me, I fancy Kurtz felt too ill that day to care, or\r\nthere would have been mischief. I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand.... No--it\xe2\x80\x99s too\r\nmuch for me. Ah, well, it\xe2\x80\x99s all over now.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt this moment I heard Kurtz\xe2\x80\x99s deep voice behind the curtain: \xe2\x80\x98Save\r\nme!--save the ivory, you mean. Don\xe2\x80\x99t tell me. Save _me!_ Why, I\xe2\x80\x99ve had to\r\nsave you. You are interrupting my plans now. Sick! Sick! Not so sick as\r\nyou would like to believe. Never mind. I\xe2\x80\x99ll carry my ideas out yet--I\r\nwill return. I\xe2\x80\x99ll show you what can be done. You with your little\r\npeddling notions--you are interfering with me. I will return. I....\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe manager came out. He did me the honour to take me under the arm\r\nand lead me aside. \xe2\x80\x98He is very low, very low,\xe2\x80\x99 he said. He considered it\r\nnecessary to sigh, but neglected to be consistently sorrowful. \xe2\x80\x98We have\r\ndone all we could for him--haven\xe2\x80\x99t we? But there is no disguising the\r\nfact, Mr. Kurtz has done more harm than good to the Company. He did\r\nnot see the time was not ripe for vigorous action. Cautiously,\r\ncautiously--that\xe2\x80\x99s my principle. We must be cautious yet. The district\r\nis closed to us for a time. Deplorable! Upon the whole, the trade will\r\nsuffer. I don\xe2\x80\x99t deny there is a remarkable quantity of ivory--mostly\r\nfossil. We must save it, at all events--but look how precarious the\r\nposition is--and why? Because the method is unsound.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Do you,\xe2\x80\x99 said I,\r\nlooking at the shore, \xe2\x80\x98call it \xe2\x80\x9cunsound method?\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Without doubt,\xe2\x80\x99 he\r\nexclaimed hotly. \xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x99... \xe2\x80\x98No method at all,\xe2\x80\x99 I murmured after\r\na while. \xe2\x80\x98Exactly,\xe2\x80\x99 he exulted. \xe2\x80\x98I anticipated this. Shows a complete\r\nwant of judgment. It is my duty to point it out in the proper quarter.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Oh,\xe2\x80\x99 said I, \xe2\x80\x98that fellow--what\xe2\x80\x99s his name?--the brickmaker, will make\r\na readable report for you.\xe2\x80\x99 He appeared confounded for a moment. It\r\nseemed to me I had never breathed an atmosphere so vile, and I turned\r\nmentally to Kurtz for relief--positively for relief. \xe2\x80\x98Nevertheless I\r\nthink Mr. Kurtz is a remarkable man,\xe2\x80\x99 I said with emphasis. He started,\r\ndropped on me a heavy glance, said very quietly, \xe2\x80\x98he _was_,\xe2\x80\x99 and turned\r\nhis back on me. My hour of favour was over; I found myself lumped along\r\nwith Kurtz as a partisan of methods for which the time was not ripe:\r\nI was unsound! Ah! but it was something to have at least a choice of\r\nnightmares.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI had turned to the wilderness really, not to Mr. Kurtz, who, I was\r\nready to admit, was as good as buried. And for a moment it seemed to me\r\nas if I also were buried in a vast grave full of unspeakable secrets. I\r\nfelt an intolerable weight oppressing my breast, the smell of the damp\r\nearth, the unseen presence of victorious corruption, the darkness of an\r\nimpenetrable night.... The Russian tapped me on the shoulder. I heard\r\nhim mumbling and stammering something about \xe2\x80\x98brother seaman--couldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nconceal--knowledge of matters that would affect Mr. Kurtz\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nreputation.\xe2\x80\x99 I waited. For him evidently Mr. Kurtz was not in his grave;\r\nI suspect that for him Mr. Kurtz was one of the immortals. \xe2\x80\x98Well!\xe2\x80\x99 said\r\nI at last, \xe2\x80\x98speak out. As it happens, I am Mr. Kurtz\xe2\x80\x99s friend--in a\r\nway.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe stated with a good deal of formality that had we not been \xe2\x80\x98of the\r\nsame profession,\xe2\x80\x99 he would have kept the matter to himself without\r\nregard to consequences. \xe2\x80\x98He suspected there was an active ill-will\r\ntowards him on the part of these white men that--\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98You are right,\xe2\x80\x99 I\r\nsaid, remembering a certain conversation I had overheard. \xe2\x80\x98The manager\r\nthinks you ought to be hanged.\xe2\x80\x99 He showed a concern at this intelligence\r\nwhich amused me at first. \xe2\x80\x98I had better get out of the way quietly,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nhe said earnestly. \xe2\x80\x98I can do no more for Kurtz now, and they would soon\r\nfind some excuse. What\xe2\x80\x99s to stop them? There\xe2\x80\x99s a military post three\r\nhundred miles from here.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Well, upon my word,\xe2\x80\x99 said I, \xe2\x80\x98perhaps you\r\nhad better go if you have any friends amongst the savages near by.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Plenty,\xe2\x80\x99 he said. \xe2\x80\x98They are simple people--and I want nothing, you\r\nknow.\xe2\x80\x99 He stood biting his lip, then: \xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t want any harm to happen\r\nto these whites here, but of course I was thinking of Mr. Kurtz\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nreputation--but you are a brother seaman and--\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98All right,\xe2\x80\x99 said I,\r\nafter a time. \xe2\x80\x98Mr. Kurtz\xe2\x80\x99s reputation is safe with me.\xe2\x80\x99 I did not know\r\nhow truly I spoke.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe informed me, lowering his voice, that it was Kurtz who had ordered\r\nthe attack to be made on the steamer. \xe2\x80\x98He hated sometimes the idea of\r\nbeing taken away--and then again.... But I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand these\r\nmatters. I am a simple man. He thought it would scare you away--that you\r\nwould give it up, thinking him dead. I could not stop him. Oh, I had an\r\nawful time of it this last month.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Very well,\xe2\x80\x99 I said. \xe2\x80\x98He is all right\r\nnow.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Ye-e-es,\xe2\x80\x99 he muttered, not very convinced apparently. \xe2\x80\x98Thanks,\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsaid I; \xe2\x80\x98I shall keep my eyes open.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98But quiet-eh?\xe2\x80\x99 he urged anxiously.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98It would be awful for his reputation if anybody here--\xe2\x80\x99 I promised a\r\ncomplete discretion with great gravity. \xe2\x80\x98I have a canoe and three\r\nblack fellows waiting not very far. I am off. Could you give me a few\r\nMartini-Henry cartridges?\xe2\x80\x99 I could, and did, with proper secrecy. He\r\nhelped himself, with a wink at me, to a handful of my tobacco. \xe2\x80\x98Between\r\nsailors--you know--good English tobacco.\xe2\x80\x99 At the door of the pilot-house\r\nhe turned round--\xe2\x80\x98I say, haven\xe2\x80\x99t you a pair of shoes you could spare?\xe2\x80\x99\r\nHe raised one leg. \xe2\x80\x98Look.\xe2\x80\x99 The soles were tied with knotted strings\r\nsandalwise under his bare feet. I rooted out an old pair, at which he\r\nlooked with admiration before tucking it under his left arm. One of his\r\npockets (bright red) was bulging with cartridges, from the other (dark\r\nblue) peeped \xe2\x80\x98Towson\xe2\x80\x99s Inquiry,\xe2\x80\x99 etc., etc. He seemed to think himself\r\nexcellently well equipped for a renewed encounter with the wilderness.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Ah! I\xe2\x80\x99ll never, never meet such a man again. You ought to have heard\r\nhim recite poetry--his own, too, it was, he told me. Poetry!\xe2\x80\x99 He rolled\r\nhis eyes at the recollection of these delights. \xe2\x80\x98Oh, he enlarged my\r\nmind!\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Good-bye,\xe2\x80\x99 said I. He shook hands and vanished in the night.\r\nSometimes I ask myself whether I had ever really seen him--whether it\r\nwas possible to meet such a phenomenon!...\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen I woke up shortly after midnight his warning came to my mind with\r\nits hint of danger that seemed, in the starred darkness, real enough to\r\nmake me get up for the purpose of having a look round. On the hill a\r\nbig fire burned, illuminating fitfully a crooked corner of the\r\nstation-house. One of the agents with a picket of a few of our blacks,\r\narmed for the purpose, was keeping guard over the ivory; but deep within\r\nthe forest, red gleams that wavered, that seemed to sink and rise from\r\nthe ground amongst confused columnar shapes of intense blackness, showed\r\nthe exact position of the camp where Mr. Kurtz\xe2\x80\x99s adorers were keeping\r\ntheir uneasy vigil. The monotonous beating of a big drum filled the air\r\nwith muffled shocks and a lingering vibration. A steady droning sound of\r\nmany men chanting each to himself some weird incantation came out from\r\nthe black, flat wall of the woods as the humming of bees comes out of\r\na hive, and had a strange narcotic effect upon my half-awake senses.\r\nI believe I dozed off leaning over the rail, till an abrupt burst of\r\nyells, an overwhelming outbreak of a pent-up and mysterious frenzy, woke\r\nme up in a bewildered wonder. It was cut short all at once, and the\r\nlow droning went on with an effect of audible and soothing silence. I\r\nglanced casually into the little cabin. A light was burning within, but\r\nMr. Kurtz was not there.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think I would have raised an outcry if I had believed my eyes. But I\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t believe them at first--the thing seemed so impossible. The fact\r\nis I was completely unnerved by a sheer blank fright, pure abstract\r\nterror, unconnected with any distinct shape of physical danger. What\r\nmade this emotion so overpowering was--how shall I define it?--the\r\nmoral shock I received, as if something altogether monstrous,\r\nintolerable to thought and odious to the soul, had been thrust upon me\r\nunexpectedly. This lasted of course the merest fraction of a second, and\r\nthen the usual sense of commonplace, deadly danger, the possibility of\r\na sudden onslaught and massacre, or something of the kind, which I saw\r\nimpending, was positively welcome and composing. It pacified me, in\r\nfact, so much that I did not raise an alarm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere was an agent buttoned up inside an ulster and sleeping on a chair\r\non deck within three feet of me. The yells had not awakened him; he\r\nsnored very slightly; I left him to his slumbers and leaped ashore.\r\nI did not betray Mr. Kurtz--it was ordered I should never betray him--it\r\nwas written I should be loyal to the nightmare of my choice. I was\r\nanxious to deal with this shadow by myself alone--and to this day I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t know why I was so jealous of sharing with any one the peculiar\r\nblackness of that experience.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAs soon as I got on the bank I saw a trail--a broad trail through the\r\ngrass. I remember the exultation with which I said to myself, \xe2\x80\x98He can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nwalk--he is crawling on all-fours--I\xe2\x80\x99ve got him.\xe2\x80\x99 The grass was wet\r\nwith dew. I strode rapidly with clenched fists. I fancy I had some vague\r\nnotion of falling upon him and giving him a drubbing. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. I\r\nhad some imbecile thoughts. The knitting old woman with the cat obtruded\r\nherself upon my memory as a most improper person to be sitting at the\r\nother end of such an affair. I saw a row of pilgrims squirting lead in\r\nthe air out of Winchesters held to the hip. I thought I would never get\r\nback to the steamer, and imagined myself living alone and unarmed in the\r\nwoods to an advanced age. Such silly things--you know. And I remember\r\nI confounded the beat of the drum with the beating of my heart, and was\r\npleased at its calm regularity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI kept to the track though--then stopped to listen. The night was very\r\nclear; a dark blue space, sparkling with dew and starlight, in which\r\nblack things stood very still. I thought I could see a kind of motion\r\nahead of me. I was strangely cocksure of everything that night. I\r\nactually left the track and ran in a wide semicircle (I verily believe\r\nchuckling to myself) so as to get in front of that stir, of that motion\r\nI had seen--if indeed I had seen anything. I was circumventing Kurtz as\r\nthough it had been a boyish game.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI came upon him, and, if he had not heard me coming, I would have\r\nfallen over him, too, but he got up in time. He rose, unsteady, long,\r\npale, indistinct, like a vapour exhaled by the earth, and swayed\r\nslightly, misty and silent before me; while at my back the fires loomed\r\nbetween the trees, and the murmur of many voices issued from the forest.\r\nI had cut him off cleverly; but when actually confronting him I seemed\r\nto come to my senses, I saw the danger in its right proportion. It was\r\nby no means over yet. Suppose he began to shout? Though he could hardly\r\nstand, there was still plenty of vigour in his voice. \xe2\x80\x98Go away--hide\r\nyourself,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, in that profound tone. It was very awful. I glanced\r\nback. We were within thirty yards from the nearest fire. A black figure\r\nstood up, strode on long black legs, waving long black arms, across the\r\nglow. It had horns--antelope horns, I think--on its head. Some sorcerer,\r\nsome witch-man, no doubt: it looked fiendlike enough. \xe2\x80\x98Do you know what\r\nyou are doing?\xe2\x80\x99 I whispered. \xe2\x80\x98Perfectly,\xe2\x80\x99 he answered, raising his voice\r\nfor that single word: it sounded to me far off and yet loud, like a hail\r\nthrough a speaking-trumpet. \xe2\x80\x98If he makes a row we are lost,\xe2\x80\x99 I thought\r\nto myself. This clearly was not a case for fisticuffs, even apart from\r\nthe very natural aversion I had to beat that Shadow--this wandering and\r\ntormented thing. \xe2\x80\x98You will be lost,\xe2\x80\x99 I said--\xe2\x80\x98utterly lost.\xe2\x80\x99 One gets\r\nsometimes such a flash of inspiration, you know. I did say the right\r\nthing, though indeed he could not have been more irretrievably lost than\r\nhe was at this very moment, when the foundations of our intimacy were\r\nbeing laid--to endure--to endure--even to the end--even beyond.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98I had immense plans,\xe2\x80\x99 he muttered irresolutely. \xe2\x80\x98Yes,\xe2\x80\x99 said I; \xe2\x80\x98but if\r\nyou try to shout I\xe2\x80\x99ll smash your head with--\xe2\x80\x99 There was not a stick or\r\na stone near. \xe2\x80\x98I will throttle you for good,\xe2\x80\x99 I corrected myself. \xe2\x80\x98I was\r\non the threshold of great things,\xe2\x80\x99 he pleaded, in a voice of longing,\r\nwith a wistfulness of tone that made my blood run cold. \xe2\x80\x98And now for\r\nthis stupid scoundrel--\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Your success in Europe is assured in any\r\ncase,\xe2\x80\x99 I affirmed steadily. I did not want to have the throttling of\r\nhim, you understand--and indeed it would have been very little use for\r\nany practical purpose. I tried to break the spell--the heavy, mute spell\r\nof the wilderness--that seemed to draw him to its pitiless breast\r\nby the awakening of forgotten and brutal instincts, by the memory of\r\ngratified and monstrous passions. This alone, I was convinced, had\r\ndriven him out to the edge of the forest, to the bush, towards the gleam\r\nof fires, the throb of drums, the drone of weird incantations; this\r\nalone had beguiled his unlawful soul beyond the bounds of permitted\r\naspirations. And, don\xe2\x80\x99t you see, the terror of the position was not in\r\nbeing knocked on the head--though I had a very lively sense of that\r\ndanger, too--but in this, that I had to deal with a being to whom I\r\ncould not appeal in the name of anything high or low. I had, even like\r\nthe niggers, to invoke him--himself--his own exalted and incredible\r\ndegradation. There was nothing either above or below him, and I knew\r\nit. He had kicked himself loose of the earth. Confound the man! he had\r\nkicked the very earth to pieces. He was alone, and I before him did\r\nnot know whether I stood on the ground or floated in the air. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been\r\ntelling you what we said--repeating the phrases we pronounced--but\r\nwhat\xe2\x80\x99s the good? They were common everyday words--the familiar, vague\r\nsounds exchanged on every waking day of life. But what of that? They had\r\nbehind them, to my mind, the terrific suggestiveness of words heard in\r\ndreams, of phrases spoken in nightmares. Soul! If anybody ever struggled\r\nwith a soul, I am the man. And I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t arguing with a lunatic either.\r\nBelieve me or not, his intelligence was perfectly clear--concentrated,\r\nit is true, upon himself with horrible intensity, yet clear; and therein\r\nwas my only chance--barring, of course, the killing him there and then,\r\nwhich wasn\xe2\x80\x99t so good, on account of unavoidable noise. But his soul was\r\nmad. Being alone in the wilderness, it had looked within itself, and, by\r\nheavens! I tell you, it had gone mad. I had--for my sins, I suppose--to\r\ngo through the ordeal of looking into it myself. No eloquence could\r\nhave been so withering to one\xe2\x80\x99s belief in mankind as his final burst of\r\nsincerity. He struggled with himself, too. I saw it--I heard it. I saw\r\nthe inconceivable mystery of a soul that knew no restraint, no faith,\r\nand no fear, yet struggling blindly with itself. I kept my head pretty\r\nwell; but when I had him at last stretched on the couch, I wiped my\r\nforehead, while my legs shook under me as though I had carried half a\r\nton on my back down that hill. And yet I had only supported him, his\r\nbony arm clasped round my neck--and he was not much heavier than a\r\nchild.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen next day we left at noon, the crowd, of whose presence behind the\r\ncurtain of trees I had been acutely conscious all the time, flowed out\r\nof the woods again, filled the clearing, covered the slope with a mass\r\nof naked, breathing, quivering, bronze bodies. I steamed up a bit, then\r\nswung down stream, and two thousand eyes followed the evolutions of\r\nthe splashing, thumping, fierce river-demon beating the water with its\r\nterrible tail and breathing black smoke into the air. In front of the\r\nfirst rank, along the river, three men, plastered with bright red earth\r\nfrom head to foot, strutted to and fro restlessly. When we came abreast\r\nagain, they faced the river, stamped their feet, nodded their horned\r\nheads, swayed their scarlet bodies; they shook towards the fierce\r\nriver-demon a bunch of black feathers, a mangy skin with a pendent\r\ntail--something that looked a dried gourd; they shouted periodically\r\ntogether strings of amazing words that resembled no sounds of human\r\nlanguage; and the deep murmurs of the crowd, interrupted suddenly, were\r\nlike the responses of some satanic litany.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe had carried Kurtz into the pilot-house: there was more air there.\r\nLying on the couch, he stared through the open shutter. There was an\r\neddy in the mass of human bodies, and the woman with helmeted head and\r\ntawny cheeks rushed out to the very brink of the stream. She put out her\r\nhands, shouted something, and all that wild mob took up the shout in a\r\nroaring chorus of articulated, rapid, breathless utterance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Do you understand this?\xe2\x80\x99 I asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHe kept on looking out past me with fiery, longing eyes, with a mingled\r\nexpression of wistfulness and hate. He made no answer, but I saw a\r\nsmile, a smile of indefinable meaning, appear on his colourless lips\r\nthat a moment after twitched convulsively. \xe2\x80\x98Do I not?\xe2\x80\x99 he said slowly,\r\ngasping, as if the words had been torn out of him by a supernatural\r\npower.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI pulled the string of the whistle, and I did this because I saw the\r\npilgrims on deck getting out their rifles with an air of anticipating a\r\njolly lark. At the sudden screech there was a movement of abject terror\r\nthrough that wedged mass of bodies. \xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t! don\xe2\x80\x99t you frighten them\r\naway,\xe2\x80\x99 cried some one on deck disconsolately. I pulled the string\r\ntime after time. They broke and ran, they leaped, they crouched, they\r\nswerved, they dodged the flying terror of the sound. The three red chaps\r\nhad fallen flat, face down on the shore, as though they had been shot\r\ndead. Only the barbarous and superb woman did not so much as flinch,\r\nand stretched tragically her bare arms after us over the sombre and\r\nglittering river.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd then that imbecile crowd down on the deck started their little fun,\r\nand I could see nothing more for smoke.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe brown current ran swiftly out of the heart of darkness, bearing us\r\ndown towards the sea with twice the speed of our upward progress; and\r\nKurtz\xe2\x80\x99s life was running swiftly, too, ebbing, ebbing out of his heart\r\ninto the sea of inexorable time. The manager was very placid, he had\r\nno vital anxieties now, he took us both in with a comprehensive and\r\nsatisfied glance: the \xe2\x80\x98affair\xe2\x80\x99 had come off as well as could be wished.\r\nI saw the time approaching when I would be left alone of the party of\r\n\xe2\x80\x98unsound method.\xe2\x80\x99 The pilgrims looked upon me with disfavour. I was,\r\nso to speak, numbered with the dead. It is strange how I accepted this\r\nunforeseen partnership, this choice of nightmares forced upon me in the\r\ntenebrous land invaded by these mean and greedy phantoms.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cKurtz discoursed. A voice! a voice! It rang deep to the very last. It\r\nsurvived his strength to hide in the magnificent folds of eloquence the\r\nbarren darkness of his heart. Oh, he struggled! he struggled! The wastes\r\nof his weary brain were haunted by shadowy images now--images of wealth\r\nand fame revolving obsequiously round his unextinguishable gift of noble\r\nand lofty expression. My Intended, my station, my career, my\r\nideas--these were the subjects for the occasional utterances of elevated\r\nsentiments. The shade of the original Kurtz frequented the bedside of\r\nthe hollow sham, whose fate it was to be buried presently in the mould\r\nof primeval earth. But both the diabolic love and the unearthly hate of\r\nthe mysteries it had penetrated fought for the possession of that\r\nsoul satiated with primitive emotions, avid of lying fame, of sham\r\ndistinction, of all the appearances of success and power.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cSometimes he was contemptibly childish. He desired to have kings meet\r\nhim at railway-stations on his return from some ghastly Nowhere, where\r\nhe intended to accomplish great things. \xe2\x80\x98You show them you have in you\r\nsomething that is really profitable, and then there will be no limits to\r\nthe recognition of your ability,\xe2\x80\x99 he would say. \xe2\x80\x98Of course you must take\r\ncare of the motives--right motives--always.\xe2\x80\x99 The long reaches that were\r\nlike one and the same reach, monotonous bends that were exactly alike,\r\nslipped past the steamer with their multitude of secular trees looking\r\npatiently after this grimy fragment of another world, the forerunner\r\nof change, of conquest, of trade, of massacres, of blessings. I looked\r\nahead--piloting. \xe2\x80\x98Close the shutter,\xe2\x80\x99 said Kurtz suddenly one day; \xe2\x80\x98I\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t bear to look at this.\xe2\x80\x99 I did so. There was a silence. \xe2\x80\x98Oh, but I\r\nwill wring your heart yet!\xe2\x80\x99 he cried at the invisible wilderness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe broke down--as I had expected--and had to lie up for repairs at the\r\nhead of an island. This delay was the first thing that shook Kurtz\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nconfidence. One morning he gave me a packet of papers and a\r\nphotograph--the lot tied together with a shoe-string. \xe2\x80\x98Keep this for\r\nme,\xe2\x80\x99 he said. \xe2\x80\x98This noxious fool\xe2\x80\x99 (meaning the manager) \xe2\x80\x98is capable of\r\nprying into my boxes when I am not looking.\xe2\x80\x99 In the afternoon I saw him.\r\nHe was lying on his back with closed eyes, and I withdrew quietly, but I\r\nheard him mutter, \xe2\x80\x98Live rightly, die, die...\xe2\x80\x99 I listened. There was\r\nnothing more. Was he rehearsing some speech in his sleep, or was it a\r\nfragment of a phrase from some newspaper article? He had been writing\r\nfor the papers and meant to do so again, \xe2\x80\x98for the furthering of my\r\nideas. It\xe2\x80\x99s a duty.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHis was an impenetrable darkness. I looked at him as you peer down at\r\na man who is lying at the bottom of a precipice where the sun never\r\nshines. But I had not much time to give him, because I was helping the\r\nengine-driver to take to pieces the leaky cylinders, to straighten a\r\nbent connecting-rod, and in other such matters. I lived in an\r\ninfernal mess of rust, filings, nuts, bolts, spanners, hammers,\r\nratchet-drills--things I abominate, because I don\xe2\x80\x99t get on with them. I\r\ntended the little forge we fortunately had aboard; I toiled wearily in a\r\nwretched scrap-heap--unless I had the shakes too bad to stand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne evening coming in with a candle I was startled to hear him say a\r\nlittle tremulously, \xe2\x80\x98I am lying here in the dark waiting for death.\xe2\x80\x99\r\nThe light was within a foot of his eyes. I forced myself to murmur, \xe2\x80\x98Oh,\r\nnonsense!\xe2\x80\x99 and stood over him as if transfixed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnything approaching the change that came over his features I have\r\nnever seen before, and hope never to see again. Oh, I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t touched.\r\nI was fascinated. It was as though a veil had been rent. I saw on that\r\nivory face the expression of sombre pride, of ruthless power, of craven\r\nterror--of an intense and hopeless despair. Did he live his life again\r\nin every detail of desire, temptation, and surrender during that supreme\r\nmoment of complete knowledge? He cried in a whisper at some image, at\r\nsome vision--he cried out twice, a cry that was no more than a breath:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98The horror! The horror!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI blew the candle out and left the cabin. The pilgrims were dining in\r\nthe mess-room, and I took my place opposite the manager, who lifted his\r\neyes to give me a questioning glance, which I successfully ignored.\r\nHe leaned back, serene, with that peculiar smile of his sealing the\r\nunexpressed depths of his meanness. A continuous shower of small flies\r\nstreamed upon the lamp, upon the cloth, upon our hands and faces.\r\nSuddenly the manager\xe2\x80\x99s boy put his insolent black head in the doorway,\r\nand said in a tone of scathing contempt:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Mistah Kurtz--he dead.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll the pilgrims rushed out to see. I remained, and went on with my\r\ndinner. I believe I was considered brutally callous. However, I did not\r\neat much. There was a lamp in there--light, don\xe2\x80\x99t you know--and outside\r\nit was so beastly, beastly dark. I went no more near the remarkable man\r\nwho had pronounced a judgment upon the adventures of his soul on this\r\nearth. The voice was gone. What else had been there? But I am of course\r\naware that next day the pilgrims buried something in a muddy hole.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cAnd then they very nearly buried me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cHowever, as you see, I did not go to join Kurtz there and then. I did\r\nnot. I remained to dream the nightmare out to the end, and to show my\r\nloyalty to Kurtz once more. Destiny. My destiny! Droll thing life\r\nis--that mysterious arrangement of merciless logic for a futile purpose.\r\nThe most you can hope from it is some knowledge of yourself--that comes\r\ntoo late--a crop of unextinguishable regrets. I have wrestled with\r\ndeath. It is the most unexciting contest you can imagine. It takes place\r\nin an impalpable greyness, with nothing underfoot, with nothing around,\r\nwithout spectators, without clamour, without glory, without the great\r\ndesire of victory, without the great fear of defeat, in a sickly\r\natmosphere of tepid scepticism, without much belief in your own right,\r\nand still less in that of your adversary. If such is the form of\r\nultimate wisdom, then life is a greater riddle than some of us think it\r\nto be. I was within a hair\xe2\x80\x99s breadth of the last opportunity for\r\npronouncement, and I found with humiliation that probably I would have\r\nnothing to say. This is the reason why I affirm that Kurtz was a\r\nremarkable man. He had something to say. He said it. Since I had peeped\r\nover the edge myself, I understand better the meaning of his stare, that\r\ncould not see the flame of the candle, but was wide enough to embrace\r\nthe whole universe, piercing enough to penetrate all the hearts that\r\nbeat in the darkness. He had summed up--he had judged. \xe2\x80\x98The horror!\xe2\x80\x99 He\r\nwas a remarkable man. After all, this was the expression of some sort of\r\nbelief; it had candour, it had conviction, it had a vibrating note of\r\nrevolt in its whisper, it had the appalling face of a glimpsed\r\ntruth--the strange commingling of desire and hate. And it is not my own\r\nextremity I remember best--a vision of greyness without form filled\r\nwith physical pain, and a careless contempt for the evanescence of all\r\nthings--even of this pain itself. No! It is his extremity that I seem to\r\nhave lived through. True, he had made that last stride, he had stepped\r\nover the edge, while I had been permitted to draw back my hesitating\r\nfoot. And perhaps in this is the whole difference; perhaps all the\r\nwisdom, and all truth, and all sincerity, are just compressed into that\r\ninappreciable moment of time in which we step over the threshold of the\r\ninvisible. Perhaps! I like to think my summing-up would not have been a\r\nword of careless contempt. Better his cry--much better. It was an\r\naffirmation, a moral victory paid for by innumerable defeats, by\r\nabominable terrors, by abominable satisfactions. But it was a victory!\r\nThat is why I have remained loyal to Kurtz to the last, and even beyond,\r\nwhen a long time after I heard once more, not his own voice, but the\r\necho of his magnificent eloquence thrown to me from a soul as\r\ntranslucently pure as a cliff of crystal.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, they did not bury me, though there is a period of time which I\r\nremember mistily, with a shuddering wonder, like a passage through some\r\ninconceivable world that had no hope in it and no desire. I found myself\r\nback in the sepulchral city resenting the sight of people hurrying\r\nthrough the streets to filch a little money from each other, to devour\r\ntheir infamous cookery, to gulp their unwholesome beer, to dream their\r\ninsignificant and silly dreams. They trespassed upon my thoughts. They\r\nwere intruders whose knowledge of life was to me an irritating pretence,\r\nbecause I felt so sure they could not possibly know the things I knew.\r\nTheir bearing, which was simply the bearing of commonplace individuals\r\ngoing about their business in the assurance of perfect safety, was\r\noffensive to me like the outrageous flauntings of folly in the face of\r\na danger it is unable to comprehend. I had no particular desire to\r\nenlighten them, but I had some difficulty in restraining myself from\r\nlaughing in their faces so full of stupid importance. I daresay I was\r\nnot very well at that time. I tottered about the streets--there were\r\nvarious affairs to settle--grinning bitterly at perfectly respectable\r\npersons. I admit my behaviour was inexcusable, but then my temperature\r\nwas seldom normal in these days. My dear aunt\xe2\x80\x99s endeavours to \xe2\x80\x98nurse up\r\nmy strength\xe2\x80\x99 seemed altogether beside the mark. It was not my strength\r\nthat wanted nursing, it was my imagination that wanted soothing. I kept\r\nthe bundle of papers given me by Kurtz, not knowing exactly what to do\r\nwith it. His mother had died lately, watched over, as I was told, by\r\nhis Intended. A clean-shaved man, with an official manner and wearing\r\ngold-rimmed spectacles, called on me one day and made inquiries, at\r\nfirst circuitous, afterwards suavely pressing, about what he was pleased\r\nto denominate certain \xe2\x80\x98documents.\xe2\x80\x99 I was not surprised, because I had\r\nhad two rows with the manager on the subject out there. I had refused\r\nto give up the smallest scrap out of that package, and I took the same\r\nattitude with the spectacled man. He became darkly menacing at last,\r\nand with much heat argued that the Company had the right to every bit of\r\ninformation about its \xe2\x80\x98territories.\xe2\x80\x99 And said he, \xe2\x80\x98Mr. Kurtz\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nknowledge of unexplored regions must have been necessarily extensive\r\nand peculiar--owing to his great abilities and to the deplorable\r\ncircumstances in which he had been placed: therefore--\xe2\x80\x99 I assured him\r\nMr. Kurtz\xe2\x80\x99s knowledge, however extensive, did not bear upon the problems\r\nof commerce or administration. He invoked then the name of science. \xe2\x80\x98It\r\nwould be an incalculable loss if,\xe2\x80\x99 etc., etc. I offered him the report\r\non the \xe2\x80\x98Suppression of Savage Customs,\xe2\x80\x99 with the postscriptum torn\r\noff. He took it up eagerly, but ended by sniffing at it with an air\r\nof contempt. \xe2\x80\x98This is not what we had a right to expect,\xe2\x80\x99 he remarked.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Expect nothing else,\xe2\x80\x99 I said. \xe2\x80\x98There are only private letters.\xe2\x80\x99 He\r\nwithdrew upon some threat of legal proceedings, and I saw him no more;\r\nbut another fellow, calling himself Kurtz\xe2\x80\x99s cousin, appeared two days\r\nlater, and was anxious to hear all the details about his dear relative\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlast moments. Incidentally he gave me to understand that Kurtz had\r\nbeen essentially a great musician. \xe2\x80\x98There was the making of an immense\r\nsuccess,\xe2\x80\x99 said the man, who was an organist, I believe, with lank grey\r\nhair flowing over a greasy coat-collar. I had no reason to doubt\r\nhis statement; and to this day I am unable to say what was Kurtz\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nprofession, whether he ever had any--which was the greatest of his\r\ntalents. I had taken him for a painter who wrote for the papers, or else\r\nfor a journalist who could paint--but even the cousin (who took snuff\r\nduring the interview) could not tell me what he had been--exactly. He\r\nwas a universal genius--on that point I agreed with the old chap, who\r\nthereupon blew his nose noisily into a large cotton handkerchief and\r\nwithdrew in senile agitation, bearing off some family letters and\r\nmemoranda without importance. Ultimately a journalist anxious to know\r\nsomething of the fate of his \xe2\x80\x98dear colleague\xe2\x80\x99 turned up. This visitor\r\ninformed me Kurtz\xe2\x80\x99s proper sphere ought to have been politics \xe2\x80\x98on the\r\npopular side.\xe2\x80\x99 He had furry straight eyebrows, bristly hair cropped\r\nshort, an eyeglass on a broad ribbon, and, becoming expansive, confessed\r\nhis opinion that Kurtz really couldn\xe2\x80\x99t write a bit--\xe2\x80\x98but heavens! how\r\nthat man could talk. He electrified large meetings. He had faith--don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nyou see?--he had the faith. He could get himself to believe\r\nanything--anything. He would have been a splendid leader of an extreme\r\nparty.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98What party?\xe2\x80\x99 I asked. \xe2\x80\x98Any party,\xe2\x80\x99 answered the other. \xe2\x80\x98He\r\nwas an--an--extremist.\xe2\x80\x99 Did I not think so? I assented. Did I know, he\r\nasked, with a sudden flash of curiosity, \xe2\x80\x98what it was that had induced\r\nhim to go out there?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Yes,\xe2\x80\x99 said I, and forthwith handed him the\r\nfamous Report for publication, if he thought fit. He glanced through it\r\nhurriedly, mumbling all the time, judged \xe2\x80\x98it would do,\xe2\x80\x99 and took himself\r\noff with this plunder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThus I was left at last with a slim packet of letters and the girl\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nportrait. She struck me as beautiful--I mean she had a beautiful\r\nexpression. I know that the sunlight can be made to lie, too, yet one\r\nfelt that no manipulation of light and pose could have conveyed the\r\ndelicate shade of truthfulness upon those features. She seemed ready to\r\nlisten without mental reservation, without suspicion, without a thought\r\nfor herself. I concluded I would go and give her back her portrait\r\nand those letters myself. Curiosity? Yes; and also some other feeling\r\nperhaps. All that had been Kurtz\xe2\x80\x99s had passed out of my hands: his soul,\r\nhis body, his station, his plans, his ivory, his career. There remained\r\nonly his memory and his Intended--and I wanted to give that up, too,\r\nto the past, in a way--to surrender personally all that remained of him\r\nwith me to that oblivion which is the last word of our common fate. I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t defend myself. I had no clear perception of what it was I really\r\nwanted. Perhaps it was an impulse of unconscious loyalty, or the\r\nfulfilment of one of those ironic necessities that lurk in the facts of\r\nhuman existence. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. I can\xe2\x80\x99t tell. But I went.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI thought his memory was like the other memories of the dead that\r\naccumulate in every man\xe2\x80\x99s life--a vague impress on the brain of shadows\r\nthat had fallen on it in their swift and final passage; but before the\r\nhigh and ponderous door, between the tall houses of a street as still\r\nand decorous as a well-kept alley in a cemetery, I had a vision of him\r\non the stretcher, opening his mouth voraciously, as if to devour all the\r\nearth with all its mankind. He lived then before me; he lived as much\r\nas he had ever lived--a shadow insatiable of splendid appearances, of\r\nfrightful realities; a shadow darker than the shadow of the night, and\r\ndraped nobly in the folds of a gorgeous eloquence. The vision seemed to\r\nenter the house with me--the stretcher, the phantom-bearers, the wild\r\ncrowd of obedient worshippers, the gloom of the forests, the glitter\r\nof the reach between the murky bends, the beat of the drum, regular and\r\nmuffled like the beating of a heart--the heart of a conquering darkness.\r\nIt was a moment of triumph for the wilderness, an invading and vengeful\r\nrush which, it seemed to me, I would have to keep back alone for the\r\nsalvation of another soul. And the memory of what I had heard him say\r\nafar there, with the horned shapes stirring at my back, in the glow of\r\nfires, within the patient woods, those broken phrases came back to\r\nme, were heard again in their ominous and terrifying simplicity. I\r\nremembered his abject pleading, his abject threats, the colossal scale\r\nof his vile desires, the meanness, the torment, the tempestuous anguish\r\nof his soul. And later on I seemed to see his collected languid manner,\r\nwhen he said one day, \xe2\x80\x98This lot of ivory now is really mine. The Company\r\ndid not pay for it. I collected it myself at a very great personal risk.\r\nI am afraid they will try to claim it as theirs though. H\xe2\x80\x99m. It is a\r\ndifficult case. What do you think I ought to do--resist? Eh? I want no\r\nmore than justice.\xe2\x80\x99... He wanted no more than justice--no more than\r\njustice. I rang the bell before a mahogany door on the first floor, and\r\nwhile I waited he seemed to stare at me out of the glassy panel--stare\r\nwith that wide and immense stare embracing, condemning, loathing all the\r\nuniverse. I seemed to hear the whispered cry, \xe2\x80\x9cThe horror! The horror!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe dusk was falling. I had to wait in a lofty drawing-room with three\r\nlong windows from floor to ceiling that were like three luminous and\r\nbedraped columns. The bent gilt legs and backs of the furniture shone in\r\nindistinct curves. The tall marble fireplace had a cold and monumental\r\nwhiteness. A grand piano stood massively in a corner; with dark gleams\r\non the flat surfaces like a sombre and polished sarcophagus. A high door\r\nopened--closed. I rose.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe came forward, all in black, with a pale head, floating towards\r\nme in the dusk. She was in mourning. It was more than a year since his\r\ndeath, more than a year since the news came; she seemed as though she\r\nwould remember and mourn forever. She took both my hands in hers and\r\nmurmured, \xe2\x80\x98I had heard you were coming.\xe2\x80\x99 I noticed she was not very\r\nyoung--I mean not girlish. She had a mature capacity for fidelity, for\r\nbelief, for suffering. The room seemed to have grown darker, as if all\r\nthe sad light of the cloudy evening had taken refuge on her forehead.\r\nThis fair hair, this pale visage, this pure brow, seemed surrounded by\r\nan ashy halo from which the dark eyes looked out at me. Their glance was\r\nguileless, profound, confident, and trustful. She carried her sorrowful\r\nhead as though she were proud of that sorrow, as though she would say,\r\n\xe2\x80\x98I--I alone know how to mourn for him as he deserves.\xe2\x80\x99 But while we were\r\nstill shaking hands, such a look of awful desolation came upon her\r\nface that I perceived she was one of those creatures that are not the\r\nplaythings of Time. For her he had died only yesterday. And, by Jove!\r\nthe impression was so powerful that for me, too, he seemed to have died\r\nonly yesterday--nay, this very minute. I saw her and him in the same\r\ninstant of time--his death and her sorrow--I saw her sorrow in the very\r\nmoment of his death. Do you understand? I saw them together--I heard\r\nthem together. She had said, with a deep catch of the breath, \xe2\x80\x98I have\r\nsurvived\xe2\x80\x99 while my strained ears seemed to hear distinctly, mingled with\r\nher tone of despairing regret, the summing up whisper of his eternal\r\ncondemnation. I asked myself what I was doing there, with a sensation\r\nof panic in my heart as though I had blundered into a place of cruel and\r\nabsurd mysteries not fit for a human being to behold. She motioned me to\r\na chair. We sat down. I laid the packet gently on the little table, and\r\nshe put her hand over it.... \xe2\x80\x98You knew him well,\xe2\x80\x99 she murmured, after\r\na moment of mourning silence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Intimacy grows quickly out there,\xe2\x80\x99 I said. \xe2\x80\x98I knew him as well as it\r\nis possible for one man to know another.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98And you admired him,\xe2\x80\x99 she said. \xe2\x80\x98It was impossible to know him and not\r\nto admire him. Was it?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98He was a remarkable man,\xe2\x80\x99 I said, unsteadily. Then before the\r\nappealing fixity of her gaze, that seemed to watch for more words on my\r\nlips, I went on, \xe2\x80\x98It was impossible not to--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Love him,\xe2\x80\x99 she finished eagerly, silencing me into an appalled\r\ndumbness. \xe2\x80\x98How true! how true! But when you think that no one knew him\r\nso well as I! I had all his noble confidence. I knew him best.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98You knew him best,\xe2\x80\x99 I repeated. And perhaps she did. But with every\r\nword spoken the room was growing darker, and only her forehead, smooth\r\nand white, remained illumined by the inextinguishable light of belief\r\nand love.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98You were his friend,\xe2\x80\x99 she went on. \xe2\x80\x98His friend,\xe2\x80\x99 she repeated, a\r\nlittle louder. \xe2\x80\x98You must have been, if he had given you this, and sent\r\nyou to me. I feel I can speak to you--and oh! I must speak. I want\r\nyou--you who have heard his last words--to know I have been worthy of\r\nhim.... It is not pride.... Yes! I am proud to know I understood\r\nhim better than any one on earth--he told me so himself. And since his\r\nmother died I have had no one--no one--to--to--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI listened. The darkness deepened. I was not even sure whether he had\r\ngiven me the right bundle. I rather suspect he wanted me to take care\r\nof another batch of his papers which, after his death, I saw the manager\r\nexamining under the lamp. And the girl talked, easing her pain in the\r\ncertitude of my sympathy; she talked as thirsty men drink. I had heard\r\nthat her engagement with Kurtz had been disapproved by her people. He\r\nwasn\xe2\x80\x99t rich enough or something. And indeed I don\xe2\x80\x99t know whether he had\r\nnot been a pauper all his life. He had given me some reason to infer\r\nthat it was his impatience of comparative poverty that drove him out\r\nthere.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98... Who was not his friend who had heard him speak once?\xe2\x80\x99 she was\r\nsaying. \xe2\x80\x98He drew men towards him by what was best in them.\xe2\x80\x99 She looked\r\nat me with intensity. \xe2\x80\x98It is the gift of the great,\xe2\x80\x99 she went on, and\r\nthe sound of her low voice seemed to have the accompaniment of all\r\nthe other sounds, full of mystery, desolation, and sorrow, I had ever\r\nheard--the ripple of the river, the soughing of the trees swayed by\r\nthe wind, the murmurs of the crowds, the faint ring of incomprehensible\r\nwords cried from afar, the whisper of a voice speaking from beyond the\r\nthreshold of an eternal darkness. \xe2\x80\x98But you have heard him! You know!\xe2\x80\x99\r\nshe cried.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Yes, I know,\xe2\x80\x99 I said with something like despair in my heart, but\r\nbowing my head before the faith that was in her, before that great and\r\nsaving illusion that shone with an unearthly glow in the darkness, in\r\nthe triumphant darkness from which I could not have defended her--from\r\nwhich I could not even defend myself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98What a loss to me--to us!\xe2\x80\x99--she corrected herself with beautiful\r\ngenerosity; then added in a murmur, \xe2\x80\x98To the world.\xe2\x80\x99 By the last gleams\r\nof twilight I could see the glitter of her eyes, full of tears--of tears\r\nthat would not fall.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98I have been very happy--very fortunate--very proud,\xe2\x80\x99 she went on. \xe2\x80\x98Too\r\nfortunate. Too happy for a little while. And now I am unhappy for--for\r\nlife.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe stood up; her fair hair seemed to catch all the remaining light in\r\na glimmer of gold. I rose, too.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98And of all this,\xe2\x80\x99 she went on mournfully, \xe2\x80\x98of all his promise, and\r\nof all his greatness, of his generous mind, of his noble heart, nothing\r\nremains--nothing but a memory. You and I--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98We shall always remember him,\xe2\x80\x99 I said hastily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98No!\xe2\x80\x99 she cried. \xe2\x80\x98It is impossible that all this should be lost--that\r\nsuch a life should be sacrificed to leave nothing--but sorrow. You\r\nknow what vast plans he had. I knew of them, too--I could not perhaps\r\nunderstand--but others knew of them. Something must remain. His words,\r\nat least, have not died.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98His words will remain,\xe2\x80\x99 I said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98And his example,\xe2\x80\x99 she whispered to herself. \xe2\x80\x98Men looked up to\r\nhim--his goodness shone in every act. His example--\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98True,\xe2\x80\x99 I said; \xe2\x80\x98his example, too. Yes, his example. I forgot that.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cBut I do not. I cannot--I cannot believe--not yet. I cannot believe\r\nthat I shall never see him again, that nobody will see him again, never,\r\nnever, never.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cShe put out her arms as if after a retreating figure, stretching them\r\nback and with clasped pale hands across the fading and narrow sheen of\r\nthe window. Never see him! I saw him clearly enough then. I shall see\r\nthis eloquent phantom as long as I live, and I shall see her, too,\r\na tragic and familiar Shade, resembling in this gesture another one,\r\ntragic also, and bedecked with powerless charms, stretching bare brown\r\narms over the glitter of the infernal stream, the stream of darkness.\r\nShe said suddenly very low, \xe2\x80\x98He died as he lived.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98His end,\xe2\x80\x99 said I, with dull anger stirring in me, \xe2\x80\x98was in every way\r\nworthy of his life.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98And I was not with him,\xe2\x80\x99 she murmured. My anger subsided before a\r\nfeeling of infinite pity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Everything that could be done--\xe2\x80\x99 I mumbled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Ah, but I believed in him more than any one on earth--more than his\r\nown mother, more than--himself. He needed me! Me! I would have treasured\r\nevery sigh, every word, every sign, every glance.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI felt like a chill grip on my chest. \xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x99 I said, in a muffled\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Forgive me. I--I have mourned so long in silence--in silence....\r\nYou were with him--to the last? I think of his loneliness. Nobody near\r\nto understand him as I would have understood. Perhaps no one to\r\nhear....\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98To the very end,\xe2\x80\x99 I said, shakily. \xe2\x80\x98I heard his very last words....\xe2\x80\x99\r\nI stopped in a fright.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Repeat them,\xe2\x80\x99 she murmured in a heart-broken tone. \xe2\x80\x98I want--I\r\nwant--something--something--to--to live with.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI was on the point of crying at her, \xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t you hear them?\xe2\x80\x99 The dusk\r\nwas repeating them in a persistent whisper all around us, in a whisper\r\nthat seemed to swell menacingly like the first whisper of a rising wind.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98The horror! The horror!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98His last word--to live with,\xe2\x80\x99 she insisted. \xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t you understand I\r\nloved him--I loved him--I loved him!\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI pulled myself together and spoke slowly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98The last word he pronounced was--your name.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9cI heard a light sigh and then my heart stood still, stopped dead short\r\nby an exulting and terrible cry, by the cry of inconceivable triumph and\r\nof unspeakable pain. \xe2\x80\x98I knew it--I was sure!\xe2\x80\x99... She knew. She was\r\nsure. I heard her weeping; she had hidden her face in her hands. It\r\nseemed to me that the house would collapse before I could escape, that\r\nthe heavens would fall upon my head. But nothing happened. The heavens\r\ndo not fall for such a trifle. Would they have fallen, I wonder, if I\r\nhad rendered Kurtz that justice which was his due? Hadn\xe2\x80\x99t he said he\r\nwanted only justice? But I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t. I could not tell her. It would have\r\nbeen too dark--too dark altogether....\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nMarlow ceased, and sat apart, indistinct and silent, in the pose of a\r\nmeditating Buddha. Nobody moved for a time. \xe2\x80\x9cWe have lost the first of\r\nthe ebb,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Director suddenly. I raised my head. The offing was\r\nbarred by a black bank of clouds, and the tranquil waterway leading to\r\nthe uttermost ends of the earth flowed sombre under an overcast\r\nsky--seemed to lead into the heart of an immense darkness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Heart of Darkness, by Joseph Conrad\r\n\r\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK HEART OF DARKNESS ***\r\n\r\n***** This file should be named 219-0.txt or 219-0.zip *****\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/2/1/219/\r\n\r\nProduced by Judith Boss and David Widger\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\r\nwill be renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\r\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\r\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\r\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.

To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\r\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n'

A yellow dressinggown,\r\nungirdled, was sustained gently behind him on the mild morning air. He\r\nheld the bowl aloft and intoned:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Introibo ad altare Dei.\r\n\r\nHalted, he peered down the dark winding stairs and called out coarsely:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Come up, Kinch! Come up, you fearful jesuit!\r\n\r\nSolemnly he came forward and mounted the round gunrest. He faced about\r\nand blessed gravely thrice the tower, the surrounding land and the\r\nawaking mountains. Then, catching sight of Stephen Dedalus, he bent\r\ntowards him and made rapid crosses in the air, gurgling in his throat\r\nand shaking his head. Stephen Dedalus, displeased and sleepy, leaned\r\nhis arms on the top of the staircase and looked coldly at the shaking\r\ngurgling face that blessed him, equine in its length, and at the light\r\nuntonsured hair, grained and hued like pale oak.\r\n\r\nBuck Mulligan peeped an instant under the mirror and then covered the\r\nbowl smartly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Back to barracks! he said sternly.\r\n\r\nHe added in a preacher\xe2\x80\x99s tone:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94For this, O dearly beloved, is the genuine Christine: body and soul and\r\nblood and ouns. Slow music, please. Shut your eyes, gents. One moment. A\r\nlittle trouble about those white corpuscles. Silence, all.\r\n\r\nHe peered sideways up and gave a long slow whistle of call, then paused\r\nawhile in rapt attention, his even white teeth glistening here and there\r\nwith gold points. Chrysostomos. Two strong shrill whistles answered\r\nthrough the calm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Thanks, old chap, he cried briskly. That will do nicely. Switch off the\r\ncurrent, will you?\r\n\r\nHe skipped off the gunrest and looked gravely at his watcher, gathering\r\nabout his legs the loose folds of his gown. The plump shadowed face and\r\nsullen oval jowl recalled a prelate, patron of arts in the middle ages.\r\nA pleasant smile broke quietly over his lips.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94The mockery of it! he said gaily. Your absurd name, an ancient Greek!\r\n\r\nHe pointed his finger in friendly jest and went over to the parapet,\r\nlaughing to himself. Stephen Dedalus stepped up, followed him wearily\r\nhalfway and sat down on the edge of the gunrest, watching him still as\r\nhe propped his mirror on the parapet, dipped the brush in the bowl and\r\nlathered cheeks and neck.\r\n\r\nBuck Mulligan\xe2\x80\x99s gay voice went on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94My name is absurd too: Malachi Mulligan, two dactyls. But it has a\r\nHellenic ring, hasn\xe2\x80\x99t it? Tripping and sunny like the buck himself.\r\nWe must go to Athens. Will you come if I can get the aunt to fork out\r\ntwenty quid?\r\n\r\nHe laid the brush aside and, laughing with delight, cried:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Will he come? The jejune jesuit!\r\n\r\nCeasing, he began to shave with care.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Tell me, Mulligan, Stephen said quietly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Yes, my love?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94How long is Haines going to stay in this tower?\r\n\r\nBuck Mulligan showed a shaven cheek over his right shoulder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94God, isn\xe2\x80\x99t he dreadful? he said frankly. A ponderous Saxon. He thinks\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99re not a gentleman. God, these bloody English! Bursting with money\r\nand indigestion. Because he comes from Oxford. You know, Dedalus, you\r\nhave the real Oxford manner. He can\xe2\x80\x99t make you out. O, my name for you\r\nis the best: Kinch, the knife-blade.\r\n\r\nHe shaved warily over his chin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94He was raving all night about a black panther, Stephen said. Where is\r\nhis guncase?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94A woful lunatic! Mulligan said. Were you in a funk?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I was, Stephen said with energy and growing fear. Out here in the dark\r\nwith a man I don\xe2\x80\x99t know raving and moaning to himself about shooting a\r\nblack panther. You saved men from drowning. I\xe2\x80\x99m not a hero, however. If\r\nhe stays on here I am off.\r\n\r\nBuck Mulligan frowned at the lather on his razorblade. He hopped down\r\nfrom his perch and began to search his trouser pockets hastily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Scutter! he cried thickly.\r\n\r\nHe came over to the gunrest and, thrusting a hand into Stephen\xe2\x80\x99s upper\r\npocket, said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Lend us a loan of your noserag to wipe my razor.\r\n\r\nStephen suffered him to pull out and hold up on show by its corner a\r\ndirty crumpled handkerchief. Buck Mulligan wiped the razorblade neatly.\r\nThen, gazing over the handkerchief, he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94The bard\xe2\x80\x99s noserag! A new art colour for our Irish poets: snotgreen.\r\nYou can almost taste it, can\xe2\x80\x99t you?\r\n\r\nHe mounted to the parapet again and gazed out over Dublin bay, his fair\r\noakpale hair stirring slightly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94God! he said quietly. Isn\xe2\x80\x99t the sea what Algy calls it: a great sweet\r\nmother? The snotgreen sea. The scrotumtightening sea. Epi oinopa ponton.\r\nAh, Dedalus, the Greeks! I must teach you. You must read them in the\r\noriginal. Thalatta! Thalatta! She is our great sweet mother. Come and\r\nlook.\r\n\r\nStephen stood up and went over to the parapet. Leaning on it he looked\r\ndown on the water and on the mailboat clearing the harbourmouth of\r\nKingstown.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Our mighty mother! Buck Mulligan said.\r\n\r\nHe turned abruptly his grey searching eyes from the sea to Stephen\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nface.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94The aunt thinks you killed your mother, he said. That\xe2\x80\x99s why she won\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nlet me have anything to do with you.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Someone killed her, Stephen said gloomily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94You could have knelt down, damn it, Kinch, when your dying mother asked\r\nyou, Buck Mulligan said. I\xe2\x80\x99m hyperborean as much as you. But to think of\r\nyour mother begging you with her last breath to kneel down and pray for\r\nher. And you refused. There is something sinister in you....\r\n\r\nHe broke off and lathered again lightly his farther cheek. A tolerant\r\nsmile curled his lips.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94But a lovely mummer! he murmured to himself. Kinch, the loveliest\r\nmummer of them all!\r\n\r\nHe shaved evenly and with care, in silence, seriously.\r\n\r\nStephen, an elbow rested on the jagged granite, leaned his palm against\r\nhis brow and gazed at the fraying edge of his shiny black coat-sleeve.\r\nPain, that was not yet the pain of love, fretted his heart. Silently, in\r\na dream she had come to him after her death, her wasted body within its\r\nloose brown graveclothes giving off an odour of wax and rosewood, her\r\nbreath, that had bent upon him, mute, reproachful, a faint odour of\r\nwetted ashes. Across the threadbare cuffedge he saw the sea hailed as a\r\ngreat sweet mother by the wellfed voice beside him. The ring of bay\r\nand skyline held a dull green mass of liquid. A bowl of white china had\r\nstood beside her deathbed holding the green sluggish bile which she had\r\ntorn up from her rotting liver by fits of loud groaning vomiting.\r\n\r\nBuck Mulligan wiped again his razorblade.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Ah, poor dogsbody! he said in a kind voice. I must give you a shirt and\r\na few noserags. How are the secondhand breeks?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94They fit well enough, Stephen answered.\r\n\r\nBuck Mulligan attacked the hollow beneath his underlip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94The mockery of it, he said contentedly. Secondleg they should be. God\r\nknows what poxy bowsy left them off. I have a lovely pair with a hair\r\nstripe, grey. You\xe2\x80\x99ll look spiffing in them. I\xe2\x80\x99m not joking, Kinch. You\r\nlook damn well when you\xe2\x80\x99re dressed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Thanks, Stephen said. I can\xe2\x80\x99t wear them if they are grey.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94He can\xe2\x80\x99t wear them, Buck Mulligan told his face in the mirror.\r\nEtiquette is etiquette. He kills his mother but he can\xe2\x80\x99t wear grey\r\ntrousers.\r\n\r\nHe folded his razor neatly and with stroking palps of fingers felt the\r\nsmooth skin.\r\n\r\nStephen turned his gaze from the sea and to the plump face with its\r\nsmokeblue mobile eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94That fellow I was with in the Ship last night, said Buck Mulligan, says\r\nyou have g. p. i. He\xe2\x80\x99s up in Dottyville with Connolly Norman. General\r\nparalysis of the insane!\r\n\r\nHe swept the mirror a half circle in the air to flash the tidings abroad\r\nin sunlight now radiant on the sea. His curling shaven lips laughed and\r\nthe edges of his white glittering teeth. Laughter seized all his strong\r\nwellknit trunk.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Look at yourself, he said, you dreadful bard!\r\n\r\nStephen bent forward and peered at the mirror held out to him, cleft by\r\na crooked crack. Hair on end. As he and others see me. Who chose this\r\nface for me? This dogsbody to rid of vermin. It asks me too.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I pinched it out of the skivvy\xe2\x80\x99s room, Buck Mulligan said. It does her\r\nall right. The aunt always keeps plainlooking servants for Malachi. Lead\r\nhim not into temptation. And her name is Ursula.\r\n\r\nLaughing again, he brought the mirror away from Stephen\xe2\x80\x99s peering eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94The rage of Caliban at not seeing his face in a mirror, he said. If\r\nWilde were only alive to see you!\r\n\r\nDrawing back and pointing, Stephen said with bitterness:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94It is a symbol of Irish art. The cracked lookingglass of a servant.\r\n\r\nBuck Mulligan suddenly linked his arm in Stephen\xe2\x80\x99s and walked with him\r\nround the tower, his razor and mirror clacking in the pocket where he\r\nhad thrust them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94It\xe2\x80\x99s not fair to tease you like that, Kinch, is it? he said kindly. God\r\nknows you have more spirit than any of them.\r\n\r\nParried again. He fears the lancet of my art as I fear that of his. The\r\ncold steel pen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Cracked lookingglass of a servant! Tell that to the oxy chap downstairs\r\nand touch him for a guinea. He\xe2\x80\x99s stinking with money and thinks you\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nnot a gentleman. His old fellow made his tin by selling jalap to Zulus\r\nor some bloody swindle or other. God, Kinch, if you and I could only\r\nwork together we might do something for the island. Hellenise it.\r\n\r\nCranly\xe2\x80\x99s arm. His arm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94And to think of your having to beg from these swine. I\xe2\x80\x99m the only one\r\nthat knows what you are. Why don\xe2\x80\x99t you trust me more? What have you\r\nup your nose against me? Is it Haines? If he makes any noise here I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nbring down Seymour and we\xe2\x80\x99ll give him a ragging worse than they gave\r\nClive Kempthorpe.\r\n\r\nYoung shouts of moneyed voices in Clive Kempthorpe\xe2\x80\x99s rooms. Palefaces:\r\nthey hold their ribs with laughter, one clasping another. O, I shall\r\nexpire! Break the news to her gently, Aubrey! I shall die! With slit\r\nribbons of his shirt whipping the air he hops and hobbles round the\r\ntable, with trousers down at heels, chased by Ades of Magdalen with the\r\ntailor\xe2\x80\x99s shears. A scared calf\xe2\x80\x99s face gilded with marmalade. I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nwant to be debagged! Don\xe2\x80\x99t you play the giddy ox with me!\r\n\r\nShouts from the open window startling evening in the quadrangle. A deaf\r\ngardener, aproned, masked with Matthew Arnold\xe2\x80\x99s face, pushes his mower\r\non the sombre lawn watching narrowly the dancing motes of grasshalms.\r\n\r\nTo ourselves... new paganism... omphalos.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Let him stay, Stephen said. There\xe2\x80\x99s nothing wrong with him except at\r\nnight.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Then what is it? Buck Mulligan asked impatiently. Cough it up. I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nquite frank with you. What have you against me now?\r\n\r\nThey halted, looking towards the blunt cape of Bray Head that lay on the\r\nwater like the snout of a sleeping whale. Stephen freed his arm quietly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Do you wish me to tell you? he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Yes, what is it? Buck Mulligan answered. I don\xe2\x80\x99t remember anything.\r\n\r\nHe looked in Stephen\xe2\x80\x99s face as he spoke. A light wind passed his brow,\r\nfanning softly his fair uncombed hair and stirring silver points of\r\nanxiety in his eyes.\r\n\r\nStephen, depressed by his own voice, said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Do you remember the first day I went to your house after my mother\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndeath?\r\n\r\nBuck Mulligan frowned quickly and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94What? Where? I can\xe2\x80\x99t remember anything. I remember only ideas and\r\nsensations. Why? What happened in the name of God?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94You were making tea, Stephen said, and went across the landing to\r\nget more hot water. Your mother and some visitor came out of the\r\ndrawingroom. She asked you who was in your room.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Yes? Buck Mulligan said. What did I say? I forget.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94You said, Stephen answered, O, it\xe2\x80\x99s only Dedalus whose mother is\r\nbeastly dead.\r\n\r\nA flush which made him seem younger and more engaging rose to Buck\r\nMulligan\xe2\x80\x99s cheek.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Did I say that? he asked. Well? What harm is that?\r\n\r\nHe shook his constraint from him nervously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94And what is death, he asked, your mother\xe2\x80\x99s or yours or my own? You\r\nsaw only your mother die. I see them pop off every day in the Mater and\r\nRichmond and cut up into tripes in the dissectingroom. It\xe2\x80\x99s a beastly\r\nthing and nothing else. It simply doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter. You wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t kneel\r\ndown to pray for your mother on her deathbed when she asked you. Why?\r\nBecause you have the cursed jesuit strain in you, only it\xe2\x80\x99s injected the\r\nwrong way. To me it\xe2\x80\x99s all a mockery and beastly. Her cerebral lobes\r\nare not functioning. She calls the doctor sir Peter Teazle and picks\r\nbuttercups off the quilt. Humour her till it\xe2\x80\x99s over. You crossed her\r\nlast wish in death and yet you sulk with me because I don\xe2\x80\x99t whinge like\r\nsome hired mute from Lalouette\xe2\x80\x99s. Absurd! I suppose I did say it. I\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t mean to offend the memory of your mother.\r\n\r\nHe had spoken himself into boldness. Stephen, shielding the gaping\r\nwounds which the words had left in his heart, said very coldly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I am not thinking of the offence to my mother.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Of what then? Buck Mulligan asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Of the offence to me, Stephen answered.\r\n\r\nBuck Mulligan swung round on his heel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94O, an impossible person! he exclaimed.\r\n\r\nHe walked off quickly round the parapet. Stephen stood at his post,\r\ngazing over the calm sea towards the headland. Sea and headland now grew\r\ndim. Pulses were beating in his eyes, veiling their sight, and he felt\r\nthe fever of his cheeks.\r\n\r\nA voice within the tower called loudly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Are you up there, Mulligan?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99m coming, Buck Mulligan answered.\r\n\r\nHe turned towards Stephen and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Look at the sea. What does it care about offences? Chuck Loyola, Kinch,\r\nand come on down. The Sassenach wants his morning rashers.\r\n\r\nHis head halted again for a moment at the top of the staircase, level\r\nwith the roof:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Don\xe2\x80\x99t mope over it all day, he said. I\xe2\x80\x99m inconsequent. Give up the\r\nmoody brooding.\r\n\r\nHis head vanished but the drone of his descending voice boomed out of\r\nthe stairhead:\r\n\r\n     And no more turn aside and brood\r\n     Upon love\xe2\x80\x99s bitter mystery\r\n     For Fergus rules the brazen cars.\r\n\r\nWoodshadows floated silently by through the morning peace from the\r\nstairhead seaward where he gazed. Inshore and farther out the mirror of\r\nwater whitened, spurned by lightshod hurrying feet. White breast of\r\nthe dim sea. The twining stresses, two by two. A hand plucking the\r\nharpstrings, merging their twining chords. Wavewhite wedded words\r\nshimmering on the dim tide.\r\n\r\nA cloud began to cover the sun slowly, wholly, shadowing the bay in\r\ndeeper green. It lay beneath him, a bowl of bitter waters. Fergus\xe2\x80\x99 song:\r\nI sang it alone in the house, holding down the long dark chords. Her\r\ndoor was open: she wanted to hear my music. Silent with awe and pity\r\nI went to her bedside. She was crying in her wretched bed. For those\r\nwords, Stephen: love\xe2\x80\x99s bitter mystery.\r\n\r\nWhere now?\r\n\r\nHer secrets: old featherfans, tasselled dancecards, powdered with musk,\r\na gaud of amber beads in her locked drawer. A birdcage hung in the sunny\r\nwindow of her house when she was a girl. She heard old Royce sing in the\r\npantomime of Turko the Terrible and laughed with others when he sang:\r\n\r\n     I am the boy\r\n     That can enjoy\r\n     Invisibility.\r\n\r\nPhantasmal mirth, folded away: muskperfumed.\r\n\r\nAnd no more turn aside and brood.\r\n\r\nFolded away in the memory of nature with her toys. Memories beset his\r\nbrooding brain. Her glass of water from the kitchen tap when she had\r\napproached the sacrament. A cored apple, filled with brown sugar,\r\nroasting for her at the hob on a dark autumn evening. Her shapely\r\nfingernails reddened by the blood of squashed lice from the children\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nshirts.\r\n\r\nIn a dream, silently, she had come to him, her wasted body within its\r\nloose graveclothes giving off an odour of wax and rosewood, her breath,\r\nbent over him with mute secret words, a faint odour of wetted ashes.\r\n\r\nHer glazing eyes, staring out of death, to shake and bend my soul. On me\r\nalone. The ghostcandle to light her agony. Ghostly light on the tortured\r\nface. Her hoarse loud breath rattling in horror, while all prayed on\r\ntheir knees. Her eyes on me to strike me down. Liliata rutilantium te\r\nconfessorum turma circumdet: iubilantium te virginum chorus excipiat.\r\n\r\nGhoul! Chewer of corpses!\r\n\r\nNo, mother! Let me be and let me live.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Kinch ahoy!\r\n\r\nBuck Mulligan\xe2\x80\x99s voice sang from within the tower. It came nearer up the\r\nstaircase, calling again. Stephen, still trembling at his soul\xe2\x80\x99s cry,\r\nheard warm running sunlight and in the air behind him friendly words.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Dedalus, come down, like a good mosey. Breakfast is ready. Haines is\r\napologising for waking us last night. It\xe2\x80\x99s all right.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99m coming, Stephen said, turning.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Do, for Jesus\xe2\x80\x99 sake, Buck Mulligan said. For my sake and for all our\r\nsakes.\r\n\r\nHis head disappeared and reappeared.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I told him your symbol of Irish art. He says it\xe2\x80\x99s very clever. Touch\r\nhim for a quid, will you? A guinea, I mean.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I get paid this morning, Stephen said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94The school kip? Buck Mulligan said. How much? Four quid? Lend us one.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94If you want it, Stephen said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Four shining sovereigns, Buck Mulligan cried with delight. We\xe2\x80\x99ll have\r\na glorious drunk to astonish the druidy druids. Four omnipotent\r\nsovereigns.\r\n\r\nHe flung up his hands and tramped down the stone stairs, singing out of\r\ntune with a Cockney accent:\r\n\r\n     O, won\xe2\x80\x99t we have a merry time,\r\n     Drinking whisky, beer and wine!\r\n     On coronation,\r\n     Coronation day!\r\n     O, won\xe2\x80\x99t we have a merry time\r\n     On coronation day!\r\n\r\nWarm sunshine merrying over the sea. The nickel shavingbowl shone,\r\nforgotten, on the parapet. Why should I bring it down? Or leave it there\r\nall day, forgotten friendship?\r\n\r\nHe went over to it, held it in his hands awhile, feeling its coolness,\r\nsmelling the clammy slaver of the lather in which the brush was stuck.\r\nSo I carried the boat of incense then at Clongowes. I am another now and\r\nyet the same. A servant too. A server of a servant.\r\n\r\nIn the gloomy domed livingroom of the tower Buck Mulligan\xe2\x80\x99s gowned form\r\nmoved briskly to and fro about the hearth, hiding and revealing its\r\nyellow glow. Two shafts of soft daylight fell across the flagged floor\r\nfrom the high barbacans: and at the meeting of their rays a cloud of\r\ncoalsmoke and fumes of fried grease floated, turning.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94We\xe2\x80\x99ll be choked, Buck Mulligan said. Haines, open that door, will you?\r\n\r\nStephen laid the shavingbowl on the locker. A tall figure rose from the\r\nhammock where it had been sitting, went to the doorway and pulled open\r\nthe inner doors.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Have you the key? a voice asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Dedalus has it, Buck Mulligan said. Janey Mack, I\xe2\x80\x99m choked!\r\n\r\nHe howled, without looking up from the fire:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Kinch!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94It\xe2\x80\x99s in the lock, Stephen said, coming forward.\r\n\r\nThe key scraped round harshly twice and, when the heavy door had been\r\nset ajar, welcome light and bright air entered. Haines stood at the\r\ndoorway, looking out. Stephen haled his upended valise to the table and\r\nsat down to wait. Buck Mulligan tossed the fry on to the dish beside\r\nhim. Then he carried the dish and a large teapot over to the table, set\r\nthem down heavily and sighed with relief.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99m melting, he said, as the candle remarked when... But, hush! Not a\r\nword more on that subject! Kinch, wake up! Bread, butter, honey. Haines,\r\ncome in. The grub is ready. Bless us, O Lord, and these thy gifts.\r\nWhere\xe2\x80\x99s the sugar? O, jay, there\xe2\x80\x99s no milk.\r\n\r\nStephen fetched the loaf and the pot of honey and the buttercooler from\r\nthe locker. Buck Mulligan sat down in a sudden pet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94What sort of a kip is this? he said. I told her to come after eight.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94We can drink it black, Stephen said thirstily. There\xe2\x80\x99s a lemon in the\r\nlocker.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94O, damn you and your Paris fads! Buck Mulligan said. I want Sandycove\r\nmilk.\r\n\r\nHaines came in from the doorway and said quietly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94That woman is coming up with the milk.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94The blessings of God on you! Buck Mulligan cried, jumping up from his\r\nchair. Sit down. Pour out the tea there. The sugar is in the bag. Here,\r\nI can\xe2\x80\x99t go fumbling at the damned eggs.\r\n\r\nHe hacked through the fry on the dish and slapped it out on three\r\nplates, saying:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94In nomine Patris et Filii et Spiritus Sancti.\r\n\r\nHaines sat down to pour out the tea.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99m giving you two lumps each, he said. But, I say, Mulligan, you do\r\nmake strong tea, don\xe2\x80\x99t you?\r\n\r\nBuck Mulligan, hewing thick slices from the loaf, said in an old woman\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwheedling voice:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94When I makes tea I makes tea, as old mother Grogan said. And when I\r\nmakes water I makes water.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94By Jove, it is tea, Haines said.\r\n\r\nBuck Mulligan went on hewing and wheedling:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94So I do, Mrs Cahill, says she. Begob, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, says Mrs Cahill, God send\r\nyou don\xe2\x80\x99t make them in the one pot.\r\n\r\nHe lunged towards his messmates in turn a thick slice of bread, impaled\r\non his knife.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94That\xe2\x80\x99s folk, he said very earnestly, for your book, Haines. Five\r\nlines of text and ten pages of notes about the folk and the fishgods of\r\nDundrum. Printed by the weird sisters in the year of the big wind.\r\n\r\nHe turned to Stephen and asked in a fine puzzled voice, lifting his\r\nbrows:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Can you recall, brother, is mother Grogan\xe2\x80\x99s tea and water pot spoken of\r\nin the Mabinogion or is it in the Upanishads?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I doubt it, said Stephen gravely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Do you now? Buck Mulligan said in the same tone. Your reasons, pray?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I fancy, Stephen said as he ate, it did not exist in or out of the\r\nMabinogion. Mother Grogan was, one imagines, a kinswoman of Mary Ann.\r\n\r\nBuck Mulligan\xe2\x80\x99s face smiled with delight.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Charming! he said in a finical sweet voice, showing his white teeth and\r\nblinking his eyes pleasantly. Do you think she was? Quite charming!\r\n\r\nThen, suddenly overclouding all his features, he growled in a hoarsened\r\nrasping voice as he hewed again vigorously at the loaf:\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x94For old Mary Ann\r\n     She doesn\xe2\x80\x99t care a damn.\r\n     But, hising up her petticoats...\r\n\r\nHe crammed his mouth with fry and munched and droned.\r\n\r\nThe doorway was darkened by an entering form.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94The milk, sir!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Come in, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, Mulligan said. Kinch, get the jug.\r\n\r\nAn old woman came forward and stood by Stephen\xe2\x80\x99s elbow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94That\xe2\x80\x99s a lovely morning, sir, she said. Glory be to God.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94To whom? Mulligan said, glancing at her. Ah, to be sure!\r\n\r\nStephen reached back and took the milkjug from the locker.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94The islanders, Mulligan said to Haines casually, speak frequently of\r\nthe collector of prepuces.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94How much, sir? asked the old woman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94A quart, Stephen said.\r\n\r\nHe watched her pour into the measure and thence into the jug rich white\r\nmilk, not hers. Old shrunken paps. She poured again a measureful and\r\na tilly. Old and secret she had entered from a morning world, maybe\r\na messenger. She praised the goodness of the milk, pouring it out.\r\nCrouching by a patient cow at daybreak in the lush field, a witch on her\r\ntoadstool, her wrinkled fingers quick at the squirting dugs. They lowed\r\nabout her whom they knew, dewsilky cattle. Silk of the kine and poor old\r\nwoman, names given her in old times. A wandering crone, lowly form of\r\nan immortal serving her conqueror and her gay betrayer, their common\r\ncuckquean, a messenger from the secret morning. To serve or to upbraid,\r\nwhether he could not tell: but scorned to beg her favour.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94It is indeed, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, Buck Mulligan said, pouring milk into their cups.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Taste it, sir, she said.\r\n\r\nHe drank at her bidding.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94If we could live on good food like that, he said to her somewhat\r\nloudly, we wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have the country full of rotten teeth and rotten\r\nguts. Living in a bogswamp, eating cheap food and the streets paved with\r\ndust, horsedung and consumptives\xe2\x80\x99 spits.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Are you a medical student, sir? the old woman asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I am, ma\xe2\x80\x99am, Buck Mulligan answered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Look at that now, she said.\r\n\r\nStephen listened in scornful silence. She bows her old head to a voice\r\nthat speaks to her loudly, her bonesetter, her medicineman: me she\r\nslights. To the voice that will shrive and oil for the grave all there\r\nis of her but her woman\xe2\x80\x99s unclean loins, of man\xe2\x80\x99s flesh made not in\r\nGod\xe2\x80\x99s likeness, the serpent\xe2\x80\x99s prey. And to the loud voice that now bids\r\nher be silent with wondering unsteady eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Do you understand what he says? Stephen asked her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Is it French you are talking, sir? the old woman said to Haines.\r\n\r\nHaines spoke to her again a longer speech, confidently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Irish, Buck Mulligan said. Is there Gaelic on you?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I thought it was Irish, she said, by the sound of it. Are you from the\r\nwest, sir?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I am an Englishman, Haines answered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94He\xe2\x80\x99s English, Buck Mulligan said, and he thinks we ought to speak Irish\r\nin Ireland.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Sure we ought to, the old woman said, and I\xe2\x80\x99m ashamed I don\xe2\x80\x99t speak the\r\nlanguage myself. I\xe2\x80\x99m told it\xe2\x80\x99s a grand language by them that knows.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Grand is no name for it, said Buck Mulligan. Wonderful entirely. Fill\r\nus out some more tea, Kinch. Would you like a cup, ma\xe2\x80\x99am?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94No, thank you, sir, the old woman said, slipping the ring of the\r\nmilkcan on her forearm and about to go.\r\n\r\nHaines said to her:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Have you your bill? We had better pay her, Mulligan, hadn\xe2\x80\x99t we?\r\n\r\nStephen filled again the three cups.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Bill, sir? she said, halting. Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s seven mornings a pint at\r\ntwopence is seven twos is a shilling and twopence over and these three\r\nmornings a quart at fourpence is three quarts is a shilling. That\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nshilling and one and two is two and two, sir.\r\n\r\nBuck Mulligan sighed and, having filled his mouth with a crust thickly\r\nbuttered on both sides, stretched forth his legs and began to search his\r\ntrouser pockets.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Pay up and look pleasant, Haines said to him, smiling.\r\n\r\nStephen filled a third cup, a spoonful of tea colouring faintly the\r\nthick rich milk. Buck Mulligan brought up a florin, twisted it round in\r\nhis fingers and cried:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94A miracle!\r\n\r\nHe passed it along the table towards the old woman, saying:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Ask nothing more of me, sweet. All I can give you I give.\r\n\r\nStephen laid the coin in her uneager hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94We\xe2\x80\x99ll owe twopence, he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Time enough, sir, she said, taking the coin. Time enough. Good morning,\r\nsir.\r\n\r\nShe curtseyed and went out, followed by Buck Mulligan\xe2\x80\x99s tender chant:\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x94Heart of my heart, were it more,\r\n     More would be laid at your feet.\r\n\r\nHe turned to Stephen and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Seriously, Dedalus. I\xe2\x80\x99m stony. Hurry out to your school kip and bring\r\nus back some money. Today the bards must drink and junket. Ireland\r\nexpects that every man this day will do his duty.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94That reminds me, Haines said, rising, that I have to visit your\r\nnational library today.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Our swim first, Buck Mulligan said.\r\n\r\nHe turned to Stephen and asked blandly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Is this the day for your monthly wash, Kinch?\r\n\r\nThen he said to Haines:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94The unclean bard makes a point of washing once a month.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94All Ireland is washed by the gulfstream, Stephen said as he let honey\r\ntrickle over a slice of the loaf.\r\n\r\nHaines from the corner where he was knotting easily a scarf about the\r\nloose collar of his tennis shirt spoke:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I intend to make a collection of your sayings if you will let me.\r\n\r\nSpeaking to me. They wash and tub and scrub. Agenbite of inwit.\r\nConscience. Yet here\xe2\x80\x99s a spot.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94That one about the cracked lookingglass of a servant being the symbol\r\nof Irish art is deuced good.\r\n\r\nBuck Mulligan kicked Stephen\xe2\x80\x99s foot under the table and said with warmth\r\nof tone:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Wait till you hear him on Hamlet, Haines.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Well, I mean it, Haines said, still speaking to Stephen. I was just\r\nthinking of it when that poor old creature came in.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Would I make any money by it? Stephen asked.\r\n\r\nHaines laughed and, as he took his soft grey hat from the holdfast of\r\nthe hammock, said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure.\r\n\r\nHe strolled out to the doorway. Buck Mulligan bent across to Stephen and\r\nsaid with coarse vigour:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94You put your hoof in it now. What did you say that for?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Well? Stephen said. The problem is to get money. From whom? From the\r\nmilkwoman or from him. It\xe2\x80\x99s a toss up, I think.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I blow him out about you, Buck Mulligan said, and then you come along\r\nwith your lousy leer and your gloomy jesuit jibes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I see little hope, Stephen said, from her or from him.\r\n\r\nBuck Mulligan sighed tragically and laid his hand on Stephen\xe2\x80\x99s arm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94From me, Kinch, he said.\r\n\r\nIn a suddenly changed tone he added:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94To tell you the God\xe2\x80\x99s truth I think you\xe2\x80\x99re right. Damn all else they\r\nare good for. Why don\xe2\x80\x99t you play them as I do? To hell with them all.\r\nLet us get out of the kip.\r\n\r\nHe stood up, gravely ungirdled and disrobed himself of his gown, saying\r\nresignedly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Mulligan is stripped of his garments.\r\n\r\nHe emptied his pockets on to the table.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94There\xe2\x80\x99s your snotrag, he said.\r\n\r\nAnd putting on his stiff collar and rebellious tie he spoke to them,\r\nchiding them, and to his dangling watchchain. His hands plunged and\r\nrummaged in his trunk while he called for a clean handkerchief. God,\r\nwe\xe2\x80\x99ll simply have to dress the character. I want puce gloves and\r\ngreen boots. Contradiction. Do I contradict myself? Very well then, I\r\ncontradict myself. Mercurial Malachi. A limp black missile flew out of\r\nhis talking hands.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94And there\xe2\x80\x99s your Latin quarter hat, he said.\r\n\r\nStephen picked it up and put it on. Haines called to them from the\r\ndoorway:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Are you coming, you fellows?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99m ready, Buck Mulligan answered, going towards the door. Come out,\r\nKinch. You have eaten all we left, I suppose. Resigned he passed out\r\nwith grave words and gait, saying, wellnigh with sorrow:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94And going forth he met Butterly.\r\n\r\nStephen, taking his ashplant from its leaningplace, followed them out\r\nand, as they went down the ladder, pulled to the slow iron door and\r\nlocked it. He put the huge key in his inner pocket.\r\n\r\nAt the foot of the ladder Buck Mulligan asked:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Did you bring the key?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I have it, Stephen said, preceding them.\r\n\r\nHe walked on. Behind him he heard Buck Mulligan club with his heavy\r\nbathtowel the leader shoots of ferns or grasses.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Down, sir! How dare you, sir!\r\n\r\nHaines asked:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Do you pay rent for this tower?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Twelve quid, Buck Mulligan said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94To the secretary of state for war, Stephen added over his shoulder.\r\n\r\nThey halted while Haines surveyed the tower and said at last:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Rather bleak in wintertime, I should say. Martello you call it?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Billy Pitt had them built, Buck Mulligan said, when the French were on\r\nthe sea. But ours is the omphalos.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94What is your idea of Hamlet? Haines asked Stephen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94No, no, Buck Mulligan shouted in pain. I\xe2\x80\x99m not equal to Thomas Aquinas\r\nand the fiftyfive reasons he has made out to prop it up. Wait till I\r\nhave a few pints in me first.\r\n\r\nHe turned to Stephen, saying, as he pulled down neatly the peaks of his\r\nprimrose waistcoat:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94You couldn\xe2\x80\x99t manage it under three pints, Kinch, could you?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94It has waited so long, Stephen said listlessly, it can wait longer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94You pique my curiosity, Haines said amiably. Is it some paradox?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Pooh! Buck Mulligan said. We have grown out of Wilde and paradoxes.\r\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s quite simple. He proves by algebra that Hamlet\xe2\x80\x99s grandson is\r\nShakespeare\xe2\x80\x99s grandfather and that he himself is the ghost of his own\r\nfather.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94What? Haines said, beginning to point at Stephen. He himself?\r\n\r\nBuck Mulligan slung his towel stolewise round his neck and, bending in\r\nloose laughter, said to Stephen\xe2\x80\x99s ear:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94O, shade of Kinch the elder! Japhet in search of a father!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94We\xe2\x80\x99re always tired in the morning, Stephen said to Haines. And it is\r\nrather long to tell.\r\n\r\nBuck Mulligan, walking forward again, raised his hands.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94The sacred pint alone can unbind the tongue of Dedalus, he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I mean to say, Haines explained to Stephen as they followed, this tower\r\nand these cliffs here remind me somehow of Elsinore. That beetles o\xe2\x80\x99er\r\nhis base into the sea, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\r\n\r\nBuck Mulligan turned suddenly for an instant towards Stephen but did not\r\nspeak. In the bright silent instant Stephen saw his own image in cheap\r\ndusty mourning between their gay attires.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94It\xe2\x80\x99s a wonderful tale, Haines said, bringing them to halt again.\r\n\r\nEyes, pale as the sea the wind had freshened, paler, firm and prudent.\r\nThe seas\xe2\x80\x99 ruler, he gazed southward over the bay, empty save for the\r\nsmokeplume of the mailboat vague on the bright skyline and a sail\r\ntacking by the Muglins.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I read a theological interpretation of it somewhere, he said bemused.\r\nThe Father and the Son idea. The Son striving to be atoned with the\r\nFather.\r\n\r\nBuck Mulligan at once put on a blithe broadly smiling face. He looked\r\nat them, his wellshaped mouth open happily, his eyes, from which he had\r\nsuddenly withdrawn all shrewd sense, blinking with mad gaiety. He moved\r\na doll\xe2\x80\x99s head to and fro, the brims of his Panama hat quivering, and\r\nbegan to chant in a quiet happy foolish voice:\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99m the queerest young fellow that ever you heard.\r\n     My mother\xe2\x80\x99s a jew, my father\xe2\x80\x99s a bird.\r\n     With Joseph the joiner I cannot agree.\r\n     So here\xe2\x80\x99s to disciples and Calvary.\r\n\r\nHe held up a forefinger of warning.\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x94If anyone thinks that I amn\xe2\x80\x99t divine\r\n     He\xe2\x80\x99ll get no free drinks when I\xe2\x80\x99m making the wine\r\n     But have to drink water and wish it were plain\r\n     That I make when the wine becomes water again.\r\n\r\nHe tugged swiftly at Stephen\xe2\x80\x99s ashplant in farewell and, running forward\r\nto a brow of the cliff, fluttered his hands at his sides like fins or\r\nwings of one about to rise in the air, and chanted:\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x94Goodbye, now, goodbye! Write down all I said\r\n     And tell Tom, Dick and Harry I rose from the dead.\r\n     What\xe2\x80\x99s bred in the bone cannot fail me to fly\r\n     And Olivet\xe2\x80\x99s breezy... Goodbye, now, goodbye!\r\n\r\nHe capered before them down towards the fortyfoot hole, fluttering his\r\nwinglike hands, leaping nimbly, Mercury\xe2\x80\x99s hat quivering in the fresh\r\nwind that bore back to them his brief birdsweet cries.\r\n\r\nHaines, who had been laughing guardedly, walked on beside Stephen and\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94We oughtn\xe2\x80\x99t to laugh, I suppose. He\xe2\x80\x99s rather blasphemous. I\xe2\x80\x99m not a\r\nbeliever myself, that is to say. Still his gaiety takes the harm out of\r\nit somehow, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t it? What did he call it? Joseph the Joiner?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94The ballad of joking Jesus, Stephen answered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94O, Haines said, you have heard it before?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Three times a day, after meals, Stephen said drily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94You\xe2\x80\x99re not a believer, are you? Haines asked. I mean, a believer in\r\nthe narrow sense of the word. Creation from nothing and miracles and a\r\npersonal God.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94There\xe2\x80\x99s only one sense of the word, it seems to me, Stephen said.\r\n\r\nHaines stopped to take out a smooth silver case in which twinkled a\r\ngreen stone. He sprang it open with his thumb and offered it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Thank you, Stephen said, taking a cigarette.\r\n\r\nHaines helped himself and snapped the case to. He put it back in his\r\nsidepocket and took from his waistcoatpocket a nickel tinderbox, sprang\r\nit open too, and, having lit his cigarette, held the flaming spunk\r\ntowards Stephen in the shell of his hands.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Yes, of course, he said, as they went on again. Either you believe\r\nor you don\xe2\x80\x99t, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it? Personally I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t stomach that idea of a\r\npersonal God. You don\xe2\x80\x99t stand for that, I suppose?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94You behold in me, Stephen said with grim displeasure, a horrible\r\nexample of free thought.\r\n\r\nHe walked on, waiting to be spoken to, trailing his ashplant by his\r\nside. Its ferrule followed lightly on the path, squealing at his heels.\r\nMy familiar, after me, calling, Steeeeeeeeeeeephen! A wavering line\r\nalong the path. They will walk on it tonight, coming here in the dark.\r\nHe wants that key. It is mine. I paid the rent. Now I eat his salt\r\nbread. Give him the key too. All. He will ask for it. That was in his\r\neyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94After all, Haines began...\r\n\r\nStephen turned and saw that the cold gaze which had measured him was not\r\nall unkind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94After all, I should think you are able to free yourself. You are your\r\nown master, it seems to me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I am a servant of two masters, Stephen said, an English and an Italian.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Italian? Haines said.\r\n\r\nA crazy queen, old and jealous. Kneel down before me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94And a third, Stephen said, there is who wants me for odd jobs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Italian? Haines said again. What do you mean?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94The imperial British state, Stephen answered, his colour rising, and\r\nthe holy Roman catholic and apostolic church.\r\n\r\nHaines detached from his underlip some fibres of tobacco before he\r\nspoke.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I can quite understand that, he said calmly. An Irishman must think\r\nlike that, I daresay. We feel in England that we have treated you rather\r\nunfairly. It seems history is to blame.\r\n\r\nThe proud potent titles clanged over Stephen\xe2\x80\x99s memory the triumph of\r\ntheir brazen bells: et unam sanctam catholicam et apostolicam ecclesiam:\r\nthe slow growth and change of rite and dogma like his own rare thoughts,\r\na chemistry of stars. Symbol of the apostles in the mass for pope\r\nMarcellus, the voices blended, singing alone loud in affirmation: and\r\nbehind their chant the vigilant angel of the church militant disarmed\r\nand menaced her heresiarchs. A horde of heresies fleeing with mitres\r\nawry: Photius and the brood of mockers of whom Mulligan was one, and\r\nArius, warring his life long upon the consubstantiality of the Son\r\nwith the Father, and Valentine, spurning Christ\xe2\x80\x99s terrene body, and the\r\nsubtle African heresiarch Sabellius who held that the Father was Himself\r\nHis own Son. Words Mulligan had spoken a moment since in mockery to the\r\nstranger. Idle mockery. The void awaits surely all them that weave the\r\nwind: a menace, a disarming and a worsting from those embattled angels\r\nof the church, Michael\xe2\x80\x99s host, who defend her ever in the hour of\r\nconflict with their lances and their shields.\r\n\r\nHear, hear! Prolonged applause. Zut! Nom de Dieu!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Of course I\xe2\x80\x99m a Britisher, Haines\xe2\x80\x99s voice said, and I feel as one. I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t want to see my country fall into the hands of German jews either.\r\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s our national problem, I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid, just now.\r\n\r\nTwo men stood at the verge of the cliff, watching: businessman, boatman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94She\xe2\x80\x99s making for Bullock harbour.\r\n\r\nThe boatman nodded towards the north of the bay with some disdain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94There\xe2\x80\x99s five fathoms out there, he said. It\xe2\x80\x99ll be swept up that way\r\nwhen the tide comes in about one. It\xe2\x80\x99s nine days today.\r\n\r\nThe man that was drowned. A sail veering about the blank bay waiting\r\nfor a swollen bundle to bob up, roll over to the sun a puffy face,\r\nsaltwhite. Here I am.\r\n\r\nThey followed the winding path down to the creek. Buck Mulligan stood on\r\na stone, in shirtsleeves, his unclipped tie rippling over his shoulder.\r\nA young man clinging to a spur of rock near him, moved slowly frogwise\r\nhis green legs in the deep jelly of the water.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Is the brother with you, Malachi?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Down in Westmeath. With the Bannons.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Still there? I got a card from Bannon. Says he found a sweet young\r\nthing down there. Photo girl he calls her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Snapshot, eh? Brief exposure.\r\n\r\nBuck Mulligan sat down to unlace his boots. An elderly man shot up near\r\nthe spur of rock a blowing red face. He scrambled up by the stones,\r\nwater glistening on his pate and on its garland of grey hair, water\r\nrilling over his chest and paunch and spilling jets out of his black\r\nsagging loincloth.\r\n\r\nBuck Mulligan made way for him to scramble past and, glancing at Haines\r\nand Stephen, crossed himself piously with his thumbnail at brow and lips\r\nand breastbone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Seymour\xe2\x80\x99s back in town, the young man said, grasping again his spur of\r\nrock. Chucked medicine and going in for the army.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Ah, go to God! Buck Mulligan said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Going over next week to stew. You know that red Carlisle girl, Lily?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Yes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Spooning with him last night on the pier. The father is rotto with\r\nmoney.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Is she up the pole?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Better ask Seymour that.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Seymour a bleeding officer! Buck Mulligan said.\r\n\r\nHe nodded to himself as he drew off his trousers and stood up, saying\r\ntritely:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Redheaded women buck like goats.\r\n\r\nHe broke off in alarm, feeling his side under his flapping shirt.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94My twelfth rib is gone, he cried. I\xe2\x80\x99m the \xc3\x9cbermensch. Toothless Kinch\r\nand I, the supermen.\r\n\r\nHe struggled out of his shirt and flung it behind him to where his\r\nclothes lay.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Are you going in here, Malachi?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Yes. Make room in the bed.\r\n\r\nThe young man shoved himself backward through the water and reached\r\nthe middle of the creek in two long clean strokes. Haines sat down on a\r\nstone, smoking.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Are you not coming in? Buck Mulligan asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Later on, Haines said. Not on my breakfast.\r\n\r\nStephen turned away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99m going, Mulligan, he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Give us that key, Kinch, Buck Mulligan said, to keep my chemise flat.\r\n\r\nStephen handed him the key. Buck Mulligan laid it across his heaped\r\nclothes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94And twopence, he said, for a pint. Throw it there.\r\n\r\nStephen threw two pennies on the soft heap. Dressing, undressing. Buck\r\nMulligan erect, with joined hands before him, said solemnly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94He who stealeth from the poor lendeth to the Lord. Thus spake\r\nZarathustra.\r\n\r\nHis plump body plunged.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94We\xe2\x80\x99ll see you again, Haines said, turning as Stephen walked up the path\r\nand smiling at wild Irish.\r\n\r\nHorn of a bull, hoof of a horse, smile of a Saxon.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94The Ship, Buck Mulligan cried. Half twelve.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Good, Stephen said.\r\n\r\nHe walked along the upwardcurving path.\r\n\r\n     Liliata rutilantium.\r\n     Turma circumdet.\r\n     Iubilantium te virginum.\r\n\r\nThe priest\xe2\x80\x99s grey nimbus in a niche where he dressed discreetly. I will\r\nnot sleep here tonight. Home also I cannot go.\r\n\r\nA voice, sweettoned and sustained, called to him from the sea. Turning\r\nthe curve he waved his hand. It called again. A sleek brown head, a\r\nseal\xe2\x80\x99s, far out on the water, round.\r\n\r\nUsurper.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[ 2 ]\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94You, Cochrane, what city sent for him?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Tarentum, sir.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Very good. Well?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94There was a battle, sir.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Very good. Where?\r\n\r\nThe boy\xe2\x80\x99s blank face asked the blank window.\r\n\r\nFabled by the daughters of memory. And yet it was in some way if not as\r\nmemory fabled it. A phrase, then, of impatience, thud of Blake\xe2\x80\x99s wings\r\nof excess. I hear the ruin of all space, shattered glass and toppling\r\nmasonry, and time one livid final flame. What\xe2\x80\x99s left us then?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I forget the place, sir. 279 B. C.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Asculum, Stephen said, glancing at the name and date in the gorescarred\r\nbook.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Yes, sir. And he said: Another victory like that and we are done for.\r\n\r\nThat phrase the world had remembered. A dull ease of the mind. From\r\na hill above a corpsestrewn plain a general speaking to his officers,\r\nleaned upon his spear. Any general to any officers. They lend ear.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94You, Armstrong, Stephen said. What was the end of Pyrrhus?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94End of Pyrrhus, sir?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I know, sir. Ask me, sir, Comyn said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Wait. You, Armstrong. Do you know anything about Pyrrhus?\r\n\r\nA bag of figrolls lay snugly in Armstrong\xe2\x80\x99s satchel. He curled them\r\nbetween his palms at whiles and swallowed them softly. Crumbs adhered to\r\nthe tissue of his lips. A sweetened boy\xe2\x80\x99s breath. Welloff people, proud\r\nthat their eldest son was in the navy. Vico Road, Dalkey.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Pyrrhus, sir? Pyrrhus, a pier.\r\n\r\nAll laughed. Mirthless high malicious laughter. Armstrong looked round\r\nat his classmates, silly glee in profile. In a moment they will laugh\r\nmore loudly, aware of my lack of rule and of the fees their papas pay.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Tell me now, Stephen said, poking the boy\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder with the book,\r\nwhat is a pier.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94A pier, sir, Armstrong said. A thing out in the water. A kind of a\r\nbridge. Kingstown pier, sir.\r\n\r\nSome laughed again: mirthless but with meaning. Two in the back bench\r\nwhispered. Yes. They knew: had never learned nor ever been innocent.\r\nAll. With envy he watched their faces: Edith, Ethel, Gerty, Lily. Their\r\nlikes: their breaths, too, sweetened with tea and jam, their bracelets\r\ntittering in the struggle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Kingstown pier, Stephen said. Yes, a disappointed bridge.\r\n\r\nThe words troubled their gaze.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94How, sir? Comyn asked. A bridge is across a river.\r\n\r\nFor Haines\xe2\x80\x99s chapbook. No-one here to hear. Tonight deftly amid wild\r\ndrink and talk, to pierce the polished mail of his mind. What then? A\r\njester at the court of his master, indulged and disesteemed, winning a\r\nclement master\xe2\x80\x99s praise. Why had they chosen all that part? Not wholly\r\nfor the smooth caress. For them too history was a tale like any other\r\ntoo often heard, their land a pawnshop.\r\n\r\nHad Pyrrhus not fallen by a beldam\xe2\x80\x99s hand in Argos or Julius Caesar not\r\nbeen knifed to death. They are not to be thought away. Time has\r\nbranded them and fettered they are lodged in the room of the infinite\r\npossibilities they have ousted. But can those have been possible seeing\r\nthat they never were? Or was that only possible which came to pass?\r\nWeave, weaver of the wind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Tell us a story, sir.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94O, do, sir. A ghoststory.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Where do you begin in this? Stephen asked, opening another book.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Weep no more, Comyn said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Go on then, Talbot.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94And the story, sir?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94After, Stephen said. Go on, Talbot.\r\n\r\nA swarthy boy opened a book and propped it nimbly under the breastwork\r\nof his satchel. He recited jerks of verse with odd glances at the text:\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x94Weep no more, woful shepherds, weep no more\r\n     For Lycidas, your sorrow, is not dead,\r\n     Sunk though he be beneath the watery floor...\r\n\r\nIt must be a movement then, an actuality of the possible as possible.\r\nAristotle\xe2\x80\x99s phrase formed itself within the gabbled verses and floated\r\nout into the studious silence of the library of Saint Genevieve where he\r\nhad read, sheltered from the sin of Paris, night by night. By his elbow\r\na delicate Siamese conned a handbook of strategy. Fed and feeding brains\r\nabout me: under glowlamps, impaled, with faintly beating feelers: and\r\nin my mind\xe2\x80\x99s darkness a sloth of the underworld, reluctant, shy of\r\nbrightness, shifting her dragon scaly folds. Thought is the thought of\r\nthought. Tranquil brightness. The soul is in a manner all that is: the\r\nsoul is the form of forms. Tranquility sudden, vast, candescent: form of\r\nforms.\r\n\r\nTalbot repeated:\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x94Through the dear might of Him that walked the waves,\r\n     Through the dear might...\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Turn over, Stephen said quietly. I don\xe2\x80\x99t see anything.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94What, sir? Talbot asked simply, bending forward.\r\n\r\nHis hand turned the page over. He leaned back and went on again, having\r\njust remembered. Of him that walked the waves. Here also over these\r\ncraven hearts his shadow lies and on the scoffer\xe2\x80\x99s heart and lips and\r\non mine. It lies upon their eager faces who offered him a coin of the\r\ntribute. To Caesar what is Caesar\xe2\x80\x99s, to God what is God\xe2\x80\x99s. A long\r\nlook from dark eyes, a riddling sentence to be woven and woven on the\r\nchurch\xe2\x80\x99s looms. Ay.\r\n\r\n     Riddle me, riddle me, randy ro.\r\n     My father gave me seeds to sow.\r\n\r\nTalbot slid his closed book into his satchel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Have I heard all? Stephen asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Yes, sir. Hockey at ten, sir.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Half day, sir. Thursday.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Who can answer a riddle? Stephen asked.\r\n\r\nThey bundled their books away, pencils clacking, pages rustling.\r\nCrowding together they strapped and buckled their satchels, all gabbling\r\ngaily:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94A riddle, sir? Ask me, sir.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94O, ask me, sir.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94A hard one, sir.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94This is the riddle, Stephen said:\r\n\r\n     The cock crew,\r\n     The sky was blue:\r\n     The bells in heaven\r\n     Were striking eleven.\r\n     \xe2\x80\x98Tis time for this poor soul\r\n     To go to heaven.\r\n\r\nWhat is that?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94What, sir?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Again, sir. We didn\xe2\x80\x99t hear.\r\n\r\nTheir eyes grew bigger as the lines were repeated. After a silence\r\nCochrane said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94What is it, sir? We give it up.\r\n\r\nStephen, his throat itching, answered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94The fox burying his grandmother under a hollybush.\r\n\r\nHe stood up and gave a shout of nervous laughter to which their cries\r\nechoed dismay.\r\n\r\nA stick struck the door and a voice in the corridor called:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Hockey!\r\n\r\nThey broke asunder, sidling out of their benches, leaping them. Quickly\r\nthey were gone and from the lumberroom came the rattle of sticks and\r\nclamour of their boots and tongues.\r\n\r\nSargent who alone had lingered came forward slowly, showing an open\r\ncopybook. His tangled hair and scraggy neck gave witness of unreadiness\r\nand through his misty glasses weak eyes looked up pleading. On his\r\ncheek, dull and bloodless, a soft stain of ink lay, dateshaped, recent\r\nand damp as a snail\xe2\x80\x99s bed.\r\n\r\nHe held out his copybook. The word Sums was written on the headline.\r\nBeneath were sloping figures and at the foot a crooked signature with\r\nblind loops and a blot. Cyril Sargent: his name and seal.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Mr Deasy told me to write them out all again, he said, and show them to\r\nyou, sir.\r\n\r\nStephen touched the edges of the book. Futility.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Do you understand how to do them now? he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Numbers eleven to fifteen, Sargent answered. Mr Deasy said I was to\r\ncopy them off the board, sir.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Can you do them yourself? Stephen asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94No, sir.\r\n\r\nUgly and futile: lean neck and tangled hair and a stain of ink, a\r\nsnail\xe2\x80\x99s bed. Yet someone had loved him, borne him in her arms and in\r\nher heart. But for her the race of the world would have trampled him\r\nunderfoot, a squashed boneless snail. She had loved his weak watery\r\nblood drained from her own. Was that then real? The only true thing\r\nin life? His mother\xe2\x80\x99s prostrate body the fiery Columbanus in holy zeal\r\nbestrode. She was no more: the trembling skeleton of a twig burnt in\r\nthe fire, an odour of rosewood and wetted ashes. She had saved him from\r\nbeing trampled underfoot and had gone, scarcely having been. A poor soul\r\ngone to heaven: and on a heath beneath winking stars a fox, red reek\r\nof rapine in his fur, with merciless bright eyes scraped in the earth,\r\nlistened, scraped up the earth, listened, scraped and scraped.\r\n\r\nSitting at his side Stephen solved out the problem. He proves by algebra\r\nthat Shakespeare\xe2\x80\x99s ghost is Hamlet\xe2\x80\x99s grandfather. Sargent peered askance\r\nthrough his slanted glasses. Hockeysticks rattled in the lumberroom: the\r\nhollow knock of a ball and calls from the field.\r\n\r\nAcross the page the symbols moved in grave morrice, in the mummery of\r\ntheir letters, wearing quaint caps of squares and cubes. Give hands,\r\ntraverse, bow to partner: so: imps of fancy of the Moors. Gone too from\r\nthe world, Averroes and Moses Maimonides, dark men in mien and movement,\r\nflashing in their mocking mirrors the obscure soul of the world, a\r\ndarkness shining in brightness which brightness could not comprehend.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Do you understand now? Can you work the second for yourself?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nIn long shaky strokes Sargent copied the data. Waiting always for a word\r\nof help his hand moved faithfully the unsteady symbols, a faint hue\r\nof shame flickering behind his dull skin. Amor matris: subjective and\r\nobjective genitive. With her weak blood and wheysour milk she had fed\r\nhim and hid from sight of others his swaddling bands.\r\n\r\nLike him was I, these sloping shoulders, this gracelessness. My\r\nchildhood bends beside me. Too far for me to lay a hand there once or\r\nlightly. Mine is far and his secret as our eyes. Secrets, silent, stony\r\nsit in the dark palaces of both our hearts: secrets weary of their\r\ntyranny: tyrants, willing to be dethroned.\r\n\r\nThe sum was done.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94It is very simple, Stephen said as he stood up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Yes, sir. Thanks, Sargent answered.\r\n\r\nHe dried the page with a sheet of thin blottingpaper and carried his\r\ncopybook back to his bench.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94You had better get your stick and go out to the others, Stephen said as\r\nhe followed towards the door the boy\xe2\x80\x99s graceless form.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nIn the corridor his name was heard, called from the playfield.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Sargent!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Run on, Stephen said. Mr Deasy is calling you.\r\n\r\nHe stood in the porch and watched the laggard hurry towards the scrappy\r\nfield where sharp voices were in strife. They were sorted in teams and\r\nMr Deasy came away stepping over wisps of grass with gaitered feet. When\r\nhe had reached the schoolhouse voices again contending called to him. He\r\nturned his angry white moustache.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94What is it now? he cried continually without listening.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Cochrane and Halliday are on the same side, sir, Stephen said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Will you wait in my study for a moment, Mr Deasy said, till I restore\r\norder here.\r\n\r\nAnd as he stepped fussily back across the field his old man\xe2\x80\x99s voice\r\ncried sternly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94What is the matter? What is it now?\r\n\r\nTheir sharp voices cried about him on all sides: their many forms closed\r\nround him, the garish sunshine bleaching the honey of his illdyed head.\r\n\r\nStale smoky air hung in the study with the smell of drab abraded leather\r\nof its chairs. As on the first day he bargained with me here. As it was\r\nin the beginning, is now. On the sideboard the tray of Stuart coins,\r\nbase treasure of a bog: and ever shall be. And snug in their spooncase\r\nof purple plush, faded, the twelve apostles having preached to all the\r\ngentiles: world without end.\r\n\r\nA hasty step over the stone porch and in the corridor. Blowing out his\r\nrare moustache Mr Deasy halted at the table.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94First, our little financial settlement, he said.\r\n\r\nHe brought out of his coat a pocketbook bound by a leather thong. It\r\nslapped open and he took from it two notes, one of joined halves, and\r\nlaid them carefully on the table.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Two, he said, strapping and stowing his pocketbook away.\r\n\r\nAnd now his strongroom for the gold. Stephen\xe2\x80\x99s embarrassed hand moved\r\nover the shells heaped in the cold stone mortar: whelks and money\r\ncowries and leopard shells: and this, whorled as an emir\xe2\x80\x99s turban, and\r\nthis, the scallop of saint James. An old pilgrim\xe2\x80\x99s hoard, dead treasure,\r\nhollow shells.\r\n\r\nA sovereign fell, bright and new, on the soft pile of the tablecloth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Three, Mr Deasy said, turning his little savingsbox about in his hand.\r\nThese are handy things to have. See. This is for sovereigns. This is for\r\nshillings. Sixpences, halfcrowns. And here crowns. See.\r\n\r\nHe shot from it two crowns and two shillings.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Three twelve, he said. I think you\xe2\x80\x99ll find that\xe2\x80\x99s right.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Thank you, sir, Stephen said, gathering the money together with shy\r\nhaste and putting it all in a pocket of his trousers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94No thanks at all, Mr Deasy said. You have earned it.\r\n\r\nStephen\xe2\x80\x99s hand, free again, went back to the hollow shells. Symbols too\r\nof beauty and of power. A lump in my pocket: symbols soiled by greed and\r\nmisery.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Don\xe2\x80\x99t carry it like that, Mr Deasy said. You\xe2\x80\x99ll pull it out somewhere\r\nand lose it. You just buy one of these machines. You\xe2\x80\x99ll find them very\r\nhandy.\r\n\r\nAnswer something.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Mine would be often empty, Stephen said.\r\n\r\nThe same room and hour, the same wisdom: and I the same. Three times\r\nnow. Three nooses round me here. Well? I can break them in this instant\r\nif I will.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Because you don\xe2\x80\x99t save, Mr Deasy said, pointing his finger. You don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nknow yet what money is. Money is power. When you have lived as long as I\r\nhave. I know, I know. If youth but knew. But what does Shakespeare say?\r\nPut but money in thy purse.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Iago, Stephen murmured.\r\n\r\nHe lifted his gaze from the idle shells to the old man\xe2\x80\x99s stare.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94He knew what money was, Mr Deasy said. He made money. A poet, yes, but\r\nan Englishman too. Do you know what is the pride of the English? Do you\r\nknow what is the proudest word you will ever hear from an Englishman\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmouth?\r\n\r\nThe seas\xe2\x80\x99 ruler. His seacold eyes looked on the empty bay: it seems\r\nhistory is to blame: on me and on my words, unhating.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94That on his empire, Stephen said, the sun never sets.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Ba! Mr Deasy cried. That\xe2\x80\x99s not English. A French Celt said that. He\r\ntapped his savingsbox against his thumbnail.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I will tell you, he said solemnly, what is his proudest boast. I paid\r\nmy way.\r\n\r\nGood man, good man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I paid my way. I never borrowed a shilling in my life. Can you feel\r\nthat? I owe nothing. Can you?\r\n\r\nMulligan, nine pounds, three pairs of socks, one pair brogues, ties.\r\nCurran, ten guineas. McCann, one guinea. Fred Ryan, two shillings.\r\nTemple, two lunches. Russell, one guinea, Cousins, ten shillings, Bob\r\nReynolds, half a guinea, Koehler, three guineas, Mrs MacKernan, five\r\nweeks\xe2\x80\x99 board. The lump I have is useless.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94For the moment, no, Stephen answered.\r\n\r\nMr Deasy laughed with rich delight, putting back his savingsbox.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I knew you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t, he said joyously. But one day you must feel it. We\r\nare a generous people but we must also be just.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I fear those big words, Stephen said, which make us so unhappy.\r\n\r\nMr Deasy stared sternly for some moments over the mantelpiece at the\r\nshapely bulk of a man in tartan fillibegs: Albert Edward, prince of\r\nWales.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94You think me an old fogey and an old tory, his thoughtful voice said.\r\nI saw three generations since O\xe2\x80\x99Connell\xe2\x80\x99s time. I remember the famine in\r\n\xe2\x80\x9846. Do you know that the orange lodges agitated for repeal of the\r\nunion twenty years before O\xe2\x80\x99Connell did or before the prelates of your\r\ncommunion denounced him as a demagogue? You fenians forget some things.\r\n\r\nGlorious, pious and immortal memory. The lodge of Diamond in Armagh the\r\nsplendid behung with corpses of papishes. Hoarse, masked and armed, the\r\nplanters\xe2\x80\x99 covenant. The black north and true blue bible. Croppies lie\r\ndown.\r\n\r\nStephen sketched a brief gesture.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I have rebel blood in me too, Mr Deasy said. On the spindle side. But I\r\nam descended from sir John Blackwood who voted for the union. We are all\r\nIrish, all kings\xe2\x80\x99 sons.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Alas, Stephen said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Per vias rectas, Mr Deasy said firmly, was his motto. He voted for it\r\nand put on his topboots to ride to Dublin from the Ards of Down to do\r\nso.\r\n\r\n     Lal the ral the ra\r\n     The rocky road to Dublin.\r\n\r\nA gruff squire on horseback with shiny topboots. Soft day, sir John!\r\nSoft day, your honour!... Day!... Day!... Two topboots jog dangling on\r\nto Dublin. Lal the ral the ra. Lal the ral the raddy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94That reminds me, Mr Deasy said. You can do me a favour, Mr Dedalus,\r\nwith some of your literary friends. I have a letter here for the press.\r\nSit down a moment. I have just to copy the end.\r\n\r\nHe went to the desk near the window, pulled in his chair twice and read\r\noff some words from the sheet on the drum of his typewriter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Sit down. Excuse me, he said over his shoulder, the dictates of common\r\nsense. Just a moment.\r\n\r\nHe peered from under his shaggy brows at the manuscript by his elbow\r\nand, muttering, began to prod the stiff buttons of the keyboard slowly,\r\nsometimes blowing as he screwed up the drum to erase an error.\r\n\r\nStephen seated himself noiselessly before the princely presence. Framed\r\naround the walls images of vanished horses stood in homage, their meek\r\nheads poised in air: lord Hastings\xe2\x80\x99 Repulse, the duke of Westminster\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nShotover, the duke of Beaufort\xe2\x80\x99s Ceylon, prix de Paris, 1866. Elfin\r\nriders sat them, watchful of a sign. He saw their speeds, backing king\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncolours, and shouted with the shouts of vanished crowds.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Full stop, Mr Deasy bade his keys. But prompt ventilation of this\r\nallimportant question...\r\n\r\nWhere Cranly led me to get rich quick, hunting his winners among the\r\nmudsplashed brakes, amid the bawls of bookies on their pitches and reek\r\nof the canteen, over the motley slush. Even money Fair Rebel. Ten to one\r\nthe field. Dicers and thimbleriggers we hurried by after the hoofs, the\r\nvying caps and jackets and past the meatfaced woman, a butcher\xe2\x80\x99s dame,\r\nnuzzling thirstily her clove of orange.\r\n\r\nShouts rang shrill from the boys\xe2\x80\x99 playfield and a whirring whistle.\r\n\r\nAgain: a goal. I am among them, among their battling bodies in a medley,\r\nthe joust of life. You mean that knockkneed mother\xe2\x80\x99s darling who seems\r\nto be slightly crawsick? Jousts. Time shocked rebounds, shock by shock.\r\nJousts, slush and uproar of battles, the frozen deathspew of the slain,\r\na shout of spearspikes baited with men\xe2\x80\x99s bloodied guts.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Now then, Mr Deasy said, rising.\r\n\r\nHe came to the table, pinning together his sheets. Stephen stood up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I have put the matter into a nutshell, Mr Deasy said. It\xe2\x80\x99s about\r\nthe foot and mouth disease. Just look through it. There can be no two\r\nopinions on the matter.\r\n\r\nMay I trespass on your valuable space. That doctrine of laissez faire\r\nwhich so often in our history. Our cattle trade. The way of all our old\r\nindustries. Liverpool ring which jockeyed the Galway harbour scheme.\r\nEuropean conflagration. Grain supplies through the narrow waters of\r\nthe channel. The pluterperfect imperturbability of the department of\r\nagriculture. Pardoned a classical allusion. Cassandra. By a woman who\r\nwas no better than she should be. To come to the point at issue.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I don\xe2\x80\x99t mince words, do I? Mr Deasy asked as Stephen read on.\r\n\r\nFoot and mouth disease. Known as Koch\xe2\x80\x99s preparation. Serum and virus.\r\nPercentage of salted horses. Rinderpest. Emperor\xe2\x80\x99s horses at M\xc3\xbcrzsteg,\r\nlower Austria. Veterinary surgeons. Mr Henry Blackwood Price. Courteous\r\noffer a fair trial. Dictates of common sense. Allimportant question. In\r\nevery sense of the word take the bull by the horns. Thanking you for the\r\nhospitality of your columns.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I want that to be printed and read, Mr Deasy said. You will see at the\r\nnext outbreak they will put an embargo on Irish cattle. And it can\r\nbe cured. It is cured. My cousin, Blackwood Price, writes to me it is\r\nregularly treated and cured in Austria by cattledoctors there. They\r\noffer to come over here. I am trying to work up influence with\r\nthe department. Now I\xe2\x80\x99m going to try publicity. I am surrounded by\r\ndifficulties, by... intrigues by... backstairs influence by...\r\n\r\nHe raised his forefinger and beat the air oldly before his voice spoke.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Mark my words, Mr Dedalus, he said. England is in the hands of the\r\njews. In all the highest places: her finance, her press. And they are\r\nthe signs of a nation\xe2\x80\x99s decay. Wherever they gather they eat up the\r\nnation\xe2\x80\x99s vital strength. I have seen it coming these years. As sure\r\nas we are standing here the jew merchants are already at their work of\r\ndestruction. Old England is dying.\r\n\r\nHe stepped swiftly off, his eyes coming to blue life as they passed a\r\nbroad sunbeam. He faced about and back again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Dying, he said again, if not dead by now.\r\n\r\n     The harlot\xe2\x80\x99s cry from street to street\r\n     Shall weave old England\xe2\x80\x99s windingsheet.\r\n\r\nHis eyes open wide in vision stared sternly across the sunbeam in which\r\nhe halted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94A merchant, Stephen said, is one who buys cheap and sells dear, jew or\r\ngentile, is he not?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94They sinned against the light, Mr Deasy said gravely. And you can see\r\nthe darkness in their eyes. And that is why they are wanderers on the\r\nearth to this day.\r\n\r\nOn the steps of the Paris stock exchange the goldskinned men quoting\r\nprices on their gemmed fingers. Gabble of geese. They swarmed loud,\r\nuncouth about the temple, their heads thickplotting under maladroit silk\r\nhats. Not theirs: these clothes, this speech, these gestures. Their full\r\nslow eyes belied the words, the gestures eager and unoffending, but\r\nknew the rancours massed about them and knew their zeal was vain. Vain\r\npatience to heap and hoard. Time surely would scatter all. A hoard\r\nheaped by the roadside: plundered and passing on. Their eyes knew their\r\nyears of wandering and, patient, knew the dishonours of their flesh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Who has not? Stephen said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94What do you mean? Mr Deasy asked.\r\n\r\nHe came forward a pace and stood by the table. His underjaw fell\r\nsideways open uncertainly. Is this old wisdom? He waits to hear from me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94History, Stephen said, is a nightmare from which I am trying to awake.\r\n\r\nFrom the playfield the boys raised a shout. A whirring whistle: goal.\r\nWhat if that nightmare gave you a back kick?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94The ways of the Creator are not our ways, Mr Deasy said. All human\r\nhistory moves towards one great goal, the manifestation of God.\r\n\r\nStephen jerked his thumb towards the window, saying:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94That is God.\r\n\r\nHooray! Ay! Whrrwhee!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94What? Mr Deasy asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94A shout in the street, Stephen answered, shrugging his shoulders.\r\n\r\nMr Deasy looked down and held for awhile the wings of his nose tweaked\r\nbetween his fingers. Looking up again he set them free.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I am happier than you are, he said. We have committed many errors and\r\nmany sins. A woman brought sin into the world. For a woman who was no\r\nbetter than she should be, Helen, the runaway wife of Menelaus, ten\r\nyears the Greeks made war on Troy. A faithless wife first brought the\r\nstrangers to our shore here, MacMurrough\xe2\x80\x99s wife and her leman, O\xe2\x80\x99Rourke,\r\nprince of Breffni. A woman too brought Parnell low. Many errors, many\r\nfailures but not the one sin. I am a struggler now at the end of my\r\ndays. But I will fight for the right till the end.\r\n\r\n     For Ulster will fight\r\n     And Ulster will be right.\r\n\r\nStephen raised the sheets in his hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Well, sir, he began.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I foresee, Mr Deasy said, that you will not remain here very long at\r\nthis work. You were not born to be a teacher, I think. Perhaps I am\r\nwrong.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94A learner rather, Stephen said.\r\n\r\nAnd here what will you learn more?\r\n\r\nMr Deasy shook his head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Who knows? he said. To learn one must be humble. But life is the great\r\nteacher.\r\n\r\nStephen rustled the sheets again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94As regards these, he began.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Yes, Mr Deasy said. You have two copies there. If you can have them\r\npublished at once.\r\n\r\nTelegraph. Irish Homestead.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I will try, Stephen said, and let you know tomorrow. I know two editors\r\nslightly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94That will do, Mr Deasy said briskly. I wrote last night to Mr Field,\r\nM.P. There is a meeting of the cattletraders\xe2\x80\x99 association today at the\r\nCity Arms hotel. I asked him to lay my letter before the meeting. You\r\nsee if you can get it into your two papers. What are they?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94The Evening Telegraph...\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94That will do, Mr Deasy said. There is no time to lose. Now I have to\r\nanswer that letter from my cousin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Good morning, sir, Stephen said, putting the sheets in his pocket.\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Not at all, Mr Deasy said as he searched the papers on his desk. I like\r\nto break a lance with you, old as I am.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Good morning, sir, Stephen said again, bowing to his bent back.\r\n\r\nHe went out by the open porch and down the gravel path under the trees,\r\nhearing the cries of voices and crack of sticks from the playfield.\r\nThe lions couchant on the pillars as he passed out through the gate:\r\ntoothless terrors. Still I will help him in his fight. Mulligan will dub\r\nme a new name: the bullockbefriending bard.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Mr Dedalus!\r\n\r\nRunning after me. No more letters, I hope.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Just one moment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Yes, sir, Stephen said, turning back at the gate.\r\n\r\nMr Deasy halted, breathing hard and swallowing his breath.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I just wanted to say, he said. Ireland, they say, has the honour of\r\nbeing the only country which never persecuted the jews. Do you know\r\nthat? No. And do you know why?\r\n\r\nHe frowned sternly on the bright air.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Why, sir? Stephen asked, beginning to smile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Because she never let them in, Mr Deasy said solemnly.\r\n\r\nA coughball of laughter leaped from his throat dragging after it a\r\nrattling chain of phlegm. He turned back quickly, coughing, laughing,\r\nhis lifted arms waving to the air.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94She never let them in, he cried again through his laughter as he\r\nstamped on gaitered feet over the gravel of the path. That\xe2\x80\x99s why.\r\n\r\nOn his wise shoulders through the checkerwork of leaves the sun flung\r\nspangles, dancing coins.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[ 3 ]\r\n\r\nIneluctable modality of the visible: at least that if no more, thought\r\nthrough my eyes. Signatures of all things I am here to read, seaspawn\r\nand seawrack, the nearing tide, that rusty boot. Snotgreen, bluesilver,\r\nrust: coloured signs. Limits of the diaphane. But he adds: in bodies.\r\nThen he was aware of them bodies before of them coloured. How? By\r\nknocking his sconce against them, sure. Go easy. Bald he was and a\r\nmillionaire, maestro di color che sanno. Limit of the diaphane in. Why\r\nin? Diaphane, adiaphane. If you can put your five fingers through it it\r\nis a gate, if not a door. Shut your eyes and see.\r\n\r\nStephen closed his eyes to hear his boots crush crackling wrack and\r\nshells. You are walking through it howsomever. I am, a stride at a time.\r\nA very short space of time through very short times of space. Five, six:\r\nthe nacheinander. Exactly: and that is the ineluctable modality of the\r\naudible. Open your eyes. No. Jesus! If I fell over a cliff that beetles\r\no\xe2\x80\x99er his base, fell through the nebeneinander ineluctably! I am getting\r\non nicely in the dark. My ash sword hangs at my side. Tap with it: they\r\ndo. My two feet in his boots are at the ends of his legs, nebeneinander.\r\nSounds solid: made by the mallet of Los Demiurgos. Am I walking into\r\neternity along Sandymount strand? Crush, crack, crick, crick. Wild sea\r\nmoney. Dominie Deasy kens them a\xe2\x80\x99.\r\n\r\n      Won\xe2\x80\x99t you come to Sandymount,\r\n      Madeline the mare?\r\n\r\nRhythm begins, you see. I hear. A catalectic tetrameter of iambs\r\nmarching. No, agallop: deline the mare.\r\n\r\nOpen your eyes now. I will. One moment. Has all vanished since? If I\r\nopen and am for ever in the black adiaphane. Basta! I will see if I can\r\nsee.\r\n\r\nSee now. There all the time without you: and ever shall be, world\r\nwithout end.\r\n\r\nThey came down the steps from Leahy\xe2\x80\x99s terrace prudently, Frauenzimmer:\r\nand down the shelving shore flabbily, their splayed feet sinking in\r\nthe silted sand. Like me, like Algy, coming down to our mighty mother.\r\nNumber one swung lourdily her midwife\xe2\x80\x99s bag, the other\xe2\x80\x99s gamp poked in\r\nthe beach. From the liberties, out for the day. Mrs Florence MacCabe,\r\nrelict of the late Patk MacCabe, deeply lamented, of Bride Street. One\r\nof her sisterhood lugged me squealing into life. Creation from nothing.\r\nWhat has she in the bag? A misbirth with a trailing navelcord, hushed\r\nin ruddy wool. The cords of all link back, strandentwining cable of\r\nall flesh. That is why mystic monks. Will you be as gods? Gaze in your\r\nomphalos. Hello. Kinch here. Put me on to Edenville. Aleph, alpha:\r\nnought, nought, one.\r\n\r\nSpouse and helpmate of Adam Kadmon: Heva, naked Eve. She had no navel.\r\nGaze. Belly without blemish, bulging big, a buckler of taut vellum,\r\nno, whiteheaped corn, orient and immortal, standing from everlasting to\r\neverlasting. Womb of sin.\r\n\r\nWombed in sin darkness I was too, made not begotten. By them, the man\r\nwith my voice and my eyes and a ghostwoman with ashes on her breath.\r\nThey clasped and sundered, did the coupler\xe2\x80\x99s will. From before the ages\r\nHe willed me and now may not will me away or ever. A lex eterna stays\r\nabout Him. Is that then the divine substance wherein Father and Son are\r\nconsubstantial? Where is poor dear Arius to try conclusions? Warring\r\nhis life long upon the contransmagnificandjewbangtantiality. Illstarred\r\nheresiarch! In a Greek watercloset he breathed his last: euthanasia.\r\nWith beaded mitre and with crozier, stalled upon his throne, widower of\r\na widowed see, with upstiffed omophorion, with clotted hinderparts.\r\n\r\nAirs romped round him, nipping and eager airs. They are coming, waves.\r\nThe whitemaned seahorses, champing, brightwindbridled, the steeds of\r\nMananaan.\r\n\r\nI mustn\xe2\x80\x99t forget his letter for the press. And after? The Ship, half\r\ntwelve. By the way go easy with that money like a good young imbecile.\r\nYes, I must.\r\n\r\nHis pace slackened. Here. Am I going to aunt Sara\xe2\x80\x99s or not? My\r\nconsubstantial father\xe2\x80\x99s voice. Did you see anything of your artist\r\nbrother Stephen lately? No? Sure he\xe2\x80\x99s not down in Strasburg terrace with\r\nhis aunt Sally? Couldn\xe2\x80\x99t he fly a bit higher than that, eh? And and\r\nand and tell us, Stephen, how is uncle Si? O, weeping God, the things\r\nI married into! De boys up in de hayloft. The drunken little costdrawer\r\nand his brother, the cornet player. Highly respectable gondoliers! And\r\nskeweyed Walter sirring his father, no less! Sir. Yes, sir. No, sir.\r\nJesus wept: and no wonder, by Christ!\r\n\r\nI pull the wheezy bell of their shuttered cottage: and wait. They take\r\nme for a dun, peer out from a coign of vantage.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94It\xe2\x80\x99s Stephen, sir.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Let him in. Let Stephen in.\r\n\r\nA bolt drawn back and Walter welcomes me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94We thought you were someone else.\r\n\r\nIn his broad bed nuncle Richie, pillowed and blanketed, extends over the\r\nhillock of his knees a sturdy forearm. Cleanchested. He has washed the\r\nupper moiety.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Morrow, nephew.\r\n\r\nHe lays aside the lapboard whereon he drafts his bills of costs for\r\nthe eyes of master Goff and master Shapland Tandy, filing consents and\r\ncommon searches and a writ of Duces Tecum. A bogoak frame over his bald\r\nhead: Wilde\xe2\x80\x99s Requiescat. The drone of his misleading whistle brings\r\nWalter back.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Yes, sir?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Malt for Richie and Stephen, tell mother. Where is she?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Bathing Crissie, sir.\r\n\r\nPapa\xe2\x80\x99s little bedpal. Lump of love.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94No, uncle Richie...\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Call me Richie. Damn your lithia water. It lowers. Whusky!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Uncle Richie, really...\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Sit down or by the law Harry I\xe2\x80\x99ll knock you down.\r\n\r\nWalter squints vainly for a chair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94He has nothing to sit down on, sir.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94He has nowhere to put it, you mug. Bring in our chippendale chair.\r\nWould you like a bite of something? None of your damned lawdeedaw airs\r\nhere. The rich of a rasher fried with a herring? Sure? So much the\r\nbetter. We have nothing in the house but backache pills.\r\n\r\nAll\xe2\x80\x99erta!\r\n\r\nHe drones bars of Ferrando\xe2\x80\x99s aria di sortita. The grandest number,\r\nStephen, in the whole opera. Listen.\r\n\r\nHis tuneful whistle sounds again, finely shaded, with rushes of the air,\r\nhis fists bigdrumming on his padded knees.\r\n\r\nThis wind is sweeter.\r\n\r\nHouses of decay, mine, his and all. You told the Clongowes gentry you\r\nhad an uncle a judge and an uncle a general in the army. Come out of\r\nthem, Stephen. Beauty is not there. Nor in the stagnant bay of Marsh\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlibrary where you read the fading prophecies of Joachim Abbas. For whom?\r\nThe hundredheaded rabble of the cathedral close. A hater of his kind\r\nran from them to the wood of madness, his mane foaming in the moon,\r\nhis eyeballs stars. Houyhnhnm, horsenostrilled. The oval equine faces,\r\nTemple, Buck Mulligan, Foxy Campbell, Lanternjaws. Abbas father, furious\r\ndean, what offence laid fire to their brains? Paff! Descende, calve, ut\r\nne nimium decalveris. A garland of grey hair on his comminated head\r\nsee him me clambering down to the footpace (_descende!_), clutching a\r\nmonstrance, basiliskeyed. Get down, baldpoll! A choir gives back menace\r\nand echo, assisting about the altar\xe2\x80\x99s horns, the snorted Latin of\r\njackpriests moving burly in their albs, tonsured and oiled and gelded,\r\nfat with the fat of kidneys of wheat.\r\n\r\nAnd at the same instant perhaps a priest round the corner is elevating\r\nit. Dringdring! And two streets off another locking it into a pyx.\r\nDringadring! And in a ladychapel another taking housel all to his own\r\ncheek. Dringdring! Down, up, forward, back. Dan Occam thought of that,\r\ninvincible doctor. A misty English morning the imp hypostasis tickled\r\nhis brain. Bringing his host down and kneeling he heard twine with his\r\nsecond bell the first bell in the transept (he is lifting his) and,\r\nrising, heard (now I am lifting) their two bells (he is kneeling) twang\r\nin diphthong.\r\n\r\nCousin Stephen, you will never be a saint. Isle of saints. You were\r\nawfully holy, weren\xe2\x80\x99t you? You prayed to the Blessed Virgin that you\r\nmight not have a red nose. You prayed to the devil in Serpentine avenue\r\nthat the fubsy widow in front might lift her clothes still more from the\r\nwet street. O si, certo! Sell your soul for that, do, dyed rags pinned\r\nround a squaw. More tell me, more still! On the top of the Howth tram\r\nalone crying to the rain: Naked women! Naked women! What about that, eh?\r\n\r\nWhat about what? What else were they invented for?\r\n\r\nReading two pages apiece of seven books every night, eh? I was young.\r\nYou bowed to yourself in the mirror, stepping forward to applause\r\nearnestly, striking face. Hurray for the Goddamned idiot! Hray! No-one\r\nsaw: tell no-one. Books you were going to write with letters for titles.\r\nHave you read his F? O yes, but I prefer Q. Yes, but W is wonderful. O\r\nyes, W. Remember your epiphanies written on green oval leaves, deeply\r\ndeep, copies to be sent if you died to all the great libraries of the\r\nworld, including Alexandria? Someone was to read them there after a few\r\nthousand years, a mahamanvantara. Pico della Mirandola like. Ay, very\r\nlike a whale. When one reads these strange pages of one long gone one\r\nfeels that one is at one with one who once...\r\n\r\nThe grainy sand had gone from under his feet. His boots trod again\r\na damp crackling mast, razorshells, squeaking pebbles, that on the\r\nunnumbered pebbles beats, wood sieved by the shipworm, lost Armada.\r\nUnwholesome sandflats waited to suck his treading soles, breathing\r\nupward sewage breath, a pocket of seaweed smouldered in seafire under a\r\nmidden of man\xe2\x80\x99s ashes. He coasted them, walking warily. A porterbottle\r\nstood up, stogged to its waist, in the cakey sand dough. A sentinel:\r\nisle of dreadful thirst. Broken hoops on the shore; at the land a maze\r\nof dark cunning nets; farther away chalkscrawled backdoors and on the\r\nhigher beach a dryingline with two crucified shirts. Ringsend: wigwams\r\nof brown steersmen and master mariners. Human shells.\r\n\r\nHe halted. I have passed the way to aunt Sara\xe2\x80\x99s. Am I not going there?\r\nSeems not. No-one about. He turned northeast and crossed the firmer sand\r\ntowards the Pigeonhouse.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Qui vous a mis dans cette fichue position?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94C\xe2\x80\x99est le pigeon, Joseph.\r\n\r\nPatrice, home on furlough, lapped warm milk with me in the bar MacMahon.\r\nSon of the wild goose, Kevin Egan of Paris. My father\xe2\x80\x99s a bird, he\r\nlapped the sweet lait chaud with pink young tongue, plump bunny\xe2\x80\x99s face.\r\nLap, lapin. He hopes to win in the gros lots. About the nature of women\r\nhe read in Michelet. But he must send me La Vie de J\xc3\xa9sus by M. L\xc3\xa9o\r\nTaxil. Lent it to his friend.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94C\xe2\x80\x99est tordant, vous savez. Moi, je suis socialiste. Je ne crois pas en\r\nl\xe2\x80\x99existence de Dieu. Faut pas le dire \xc3\xa0 mon p\xc3\xa8re.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Il croit?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Mon p\xc3\xa8re, oui.\r\n\r\nSchluss. He laps.\r\n\r\nMy Latin quarter hat. God, we simply must dress the character. I want\r\npuce gloves. You were a student, weren\xe2\x80\x99t you? Of what in the other\r\ndevil\xe2\x80\x99s name? Paysayenn. P. C. N., you know: physiques, chimiques et\r\nnaturelles. Aha. Eating your groatsworth of mou en civet, fleshpots of\r\nEgypt, elbowed by belching cabmen. Just say in the most natural tone:\r\nwhen I was in Paris; boul\xe2\x80\x99 Mich\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99, I used to. Yes, used to carry punched\r\ntickets to prove an alibi if they arrested you for murder somewhere.\r\nJustice. On the night of the seventeenth of February 1904 the prisoner\r\nwas seen by two witnesses. Other fellow did it: other me. Hat, tie,\r\novercoat, nose. Lui, c\xe2\x80\x99est moi. You seem to have enjoyed yourself.\r\n\r\nProudly walking. Whom were you trying to walk like? Forget: a\r\ndispossessed. With mother\xe2\x80\x99s money order, eight shillings, the banging\r\ndoor of the post office slammed in your face by the usher. Hunger\r\ntoothache. Encore deux minutes. Look clock. Must get. Ferm\xc3\xa9. Hired dog!\r\nShoot him to bloody bits with a bang shotgun, bits man spattered walls\r\nall brass buttons. Bits all khrrrrklak in place clack back. Not hurt?\r\nO, that\xe2\x80\x99s all right. Shake hands. See what I meant, see? O, that\xe2\x80\x99s all\r\nright. Shake a shake. O, that\xe2\x80\x99s all only all right.\r\n\r\nYou were going to do wonders, what? Missionary to Europe after fiery\r\nColumbanus. Fiacre and Scotus on their creepystools in heaven spilt\r\nfrom their pintpots, loudlatinlaughing: Euge! Euge! Pretending to speak\r\nbroken English as you dragged your valise, porter threepence, across the\r\nslimy pier at Newhaven. Comment? Rich booty you brought back; Le Tutu,\r\nfive tattered numbers of Pantalon Blanc et Culotte Rouge; a blue French\r\ntelegram, curiosity to show:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Mother dying come home father.\r\n\r\nThe aunt thinks you killed your mother. That\xe2\x80\x99s why she won\xe2\x80\x99t.\r\n\r\n     Then here\xe2\x80\x99s a health to Mulligan\xe2\x80\x99s aunt\r\n     And I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you the reason why.\r\n     She always kept things decent in\r\n     The Hannigan famileye.\r\n\r\nHis feet marched in sudden proud rhythm over the sand furrows, along by\r\nthe boulders of the south wall. He stared at them proudly, piled stone\r\nmammoth skulls. Gold light on sea, on sand, on boulders. The sun is\r\nthere, the slender trees, the lemon houses.\r\n\r\nParis rawly waking, crude sunlight on her lemon streets. Moist pith of\r\nfarls of bread, the froggreen wormwood, her matin incense, court\r\nthe air. Belluomo rises from the bed of his wife\xe2\x80\x99s lover\xe2\x80\x99s wife, the\r\nkerchiefed housewife is astir, a saucer of acetic acid in her hand. In\r\nRodot\xe2\x80\x99s Yvonne and Madeleine newmake their tumbled beauties, shattering\r\nwith gold teeth chaussons of pastry, their mouths yellowed with the pus\r\nof flan br\xc3\xa9ton. Faces of Paris men go by, their wellpleased pleasers,\r\ncurled conquistadores.\r\n\r\nNoon slumbers. Kevin Egan rolls gunpowder cigarettes through fingers\r\nsmeared with printer\xe2\x80\x99s ink, sipping his green fairy as Patrice his\r\nwhite. About us gobblers fork spiced beans down their gullets. Un demi\r\ns\xc3\xa9tier! A jet of coffee steam from the burnished caldron. She serves me\r\nat his beck. Il est irlandais. Hollandais? Non fromage. Deux irlandais,\r\nnous, Irlande, vous savez ah, oui! She thought you wanted a cheese\r\nhollandais. Your postprandial, do you know that word? Postprandial.\r\nThere was a fellow I knew once in Barcelona, queer fellow, used to call\r\nit his postprandial. Well: slainte! Around the slabbed tables the\r\ntangle of wined breaths and grumbling gorges. His breath hangs over our\r\nsaucestained plates, the green fairy\xe2\x80\x99s fang thrusting between his lips.\r\nOf Ireland, the Dalcassians, of hopes, conspiracies, of Arthur Griffith\r\nnow, A E, pimander, good shepherd of men. To yoke me as his yokefellow,\r\nour crimes our common cause. You\xe2\x80\x99re your father\xe2\x80\x99s son. I know the voice.\r\nHis fustian shirt, sanguineflowered, trembles its Spanish tassels at\r\nhis secrets. M. Drumont, famous journalist, Drumont, know what he called\r\nqueen Victoria? Old hag with the yellow teeth. Vieille ogresse with\r\nthe dents jaunes. Maud Gonne, beautiful woman, La Patrie, M. Millevoye,\r\nF\xc3\xa9lix Faure, know how he died? Licentious men. The froeken, bonne \xc3\xa0 tout\r\nfaire, who rubs male nakedness in the bath at Upsala. Moi faire, she\r\nsaid, Tous les messieurs. Not this Monsieur, I said. Most licentious\r\ncustom. Bath a most private thing. I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t let my brother, not even\r\nmy own brother, most lascivious thing. Green eyes, I see you. Fang, I\r\nfeel. Lascivious people.\r\n\r\nThe blue fuse burns deadly between hands and burns clear. Loose\r\ntobaccoshreds catch fire: a flame and acrid smoke light our corner. Raw\r\nfacebones under his peep of day boy\xe2\x80\x99s hat. How the head centre got away,\r\nauthentic version. Got up as a young bride, man, veil, orangeblossoms,\r\ndrove out the road to Malahide. Did, faith. Of lost leaders, the\r\nbetrayed, wild escapes. Disguises, clutched at, gone, not here.\r\n\r\nSpurned lover. I was a strapping young gossoon at that time, I tell you.\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll show you my likeness one day. I was, faith. Lover, for her love he\r\nprowled with colonel Richard Burke, tanist of his sept, under the walls\r\nof Clerkenwell and, crouching, saw a flame of vengeance hurl them upward\r\nin the fog. Shattered glass and toppling masonry. In gay Paree he hides,\r\nEgan of Paris, unsought by any save by me. Making his day\xe2\x80\x99s stations,\r\nthe dingy printingcase, his three taverns, the Montmartre lair he sleeps\r\nshort night in, rue de la Goutte-d\xe2\x80\x99Or, damascened with flyblown faces of\r\nthe gone. Loveless, landless, wifeless. She is quite nicey comfy without\r\nher outcast man, madame in rue G\xc3\xaet-le-C\xc5\x93ur, canary and two buck lodgers.\r\nPeachy cheeks, a zebra skirt, frisky as a young thing\xe2\x80\x99s. Spurned and\r\nundespairing. Tell Pat you saw me, won\xe2\x80\x99t you? I wanted to get poor Pat a\r\njob one time. Mon fils, soldier of France. I taught him to sing The\r\nboys of Kilkenny are stout roaring blades. Know that old lay? I taught\r\nPatrice that. Old Kilkenny: saint Canice, Strongbow\xe2\x80\x99s castle on the\r\nNore. Goes like this. O, O. He takes me, Napper Tandy, by the hand.\r\n\r\n     O, O the boys of\r\n     Kilkenny...\r\n\r\nWeak wasting hand on mine. They have forgotten Kevin Egan, not he them.\r\nRemembering thee, O Sion.\r\n\r\nHe had come nearer the edge of the sea and wet sand slapped his boots.\r\nThe new air greeted him, harping in wild nerves, wind of wild air of\r\nseeds of brightness. Here, I am not walking out to the Kish lightship,\r\nam I? He stood suddenly, his feet beginning to sink slowly in the\r\nquaking soil. Turn back.\r\n\r\nTurning, he scanned the shore south, his feet sinking again slowly\r\nin new sockets. The cold domed room of the tower waits. Through the\r\nbarbacans the shafts of light are moving ever, slowly ever as my\r\nfeet are sinking, creeping duskward over the dial floor. Blue dusk,\r\nnightfall, deep blue night. In the darkness of the dome they wait,\r\ntheir pushedback chairs, my obelisk valise, around a board of abandoned\r\nplatters. Who to clear it? He has the key. I will not sleep there when\r\nthis night comes. A shut door of a silent tower, entombing their blind\r\nbodies, the panthersahib and his pointer. Call: no answer. He lifted his\r\nfeet up from the suck and turned back by the mole of boulders. Take\r\nall, keep all. My soul walks with me, form of forms. So in the moon\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmidwatches I pace the path above the rocks, in sable silvered, hearing\r\nElsinore\xe2\x80\x99s tempting flood.\r\n\r\nThe flood is following me. I can watch it flow past from here. Get back\r\nthen by the Poolbeg road to the strand there. He climbed over the sedge\r\nand eely oarweeds and sat on a stool of rock, resting his ashplant in a\r\ngrike.\r\n\r\nA bloated carcass of a dog lay lolled on bladderwrack. Before him the\r\ngunwale of a boat, sunk in sand. Un coche ensabl\xc3\xa9 Louis Veuillot called\r\nGautier\xe2\x80\x99s prose. These heavy sands are language tide and wind have\r\nsilted here. And these, the stoneheaps of dead builders, a warren of\r\nweasel rats. Hide gold there. Try it. You have some. Sands and stones.\r\nHeavy of the past. Sir Lout\xe2\x80\x99s toys. Mind you don\xe2\x80\x99t get one bang on the\r\near. I\xe2\x80\x99m the bloody well gigant rolls all them bloody well boulders,\r\nbones for my steppingstones. Feefawfum. I zmellz de bloodz odz an\r\nIridzman.\r\n\r\nA point, live dog, grew into sight running across the sweep of sand.\r\nLord, is he going to attack me? Respect his liberty. You will not\r\nbe master of others or their slave. I have my stick. Sit tight. From\r\nfarther away, walking shoreward across from the crested tide, figures,\r\ntwo. The two maries. They have tucked it safe mong the bulrushes.\r\nPeekaboo. I see you. No, the dog. He is running back to them. Who?\r\n\r\nGalleys of the Lochlanns ran here to beach, in quest of prey, their\r\nbloodbeaked prows riding low on a molten pewter surf. Dane vikings,\r\ntorcs of tomahawks aglitter on their breasts when Malachi wore the\r\ncollar of gold. A school of turlehide whales stranded in hot noon,\r\nspouting, hobbling in the shallows. Then from the starving cagework city\r\na horde of jerkined dwarfs, my people, with flayers\xe2\x80\x99 knives, running,\r\nscaling, hacking in green blubbery whalemeat. Famine, plague and\r\nslaughters. Their blood is in me, their lusts my waves. I moved among\r\nthem on the frozen Liffey, that I, a changeling, among the spluttering\r\nresin fires. I spoke to no-one: none to me.\r\n\r\nThe dog\xe2\x80\x99s bark ran towards him, stopped, ran back. Dog of my enemy.\r\nI just simply stood pale, silent, bayed about. Terribilia meditans. A\r\nprimrose doublet, fortune\xe2\x80\x99s knave, smiled on my fear. For that are you\r\npining, the bark of their applause? Pretenders: live their lives. The\r\nBruce\xe2\x80\x99s brother, Thomas Fitzgerald, silken knight, Perkin Warbeck,\r\nYork\xe2\x80\x99s false scion, in breeches of silk of whiterose ivory, wonder of\r\na day, and Lambert Simnel, with a tail of nans and sutlers, a scullion\r\ncrowned. All kings\xe2\x80\x99 sons. Paradise of pretenders then and now. He saved\r\nmen from drowning and you shake at a cur\xe2\x80\x99s yelping. But the courtiers\r\nwho mocked Guido in Or san Michele were in their own house. House of...\r\nWe don\xe2\x80\x99t want any of your medieval abstrusiosities. Would you do what\r\nhe did? A boat would be near, a lifebuoy. Nat\xc3\xbcrlich, put there for you.\r\nWould you or would you not? The man that was drowned nine days ago off\r\nMaiden\xe2\x80\x99s rock. They are waiting for him now. The truth, spit it out. I\r\nwould want to. I would try. I am not a strong swimmer. Water cold soft.\r\nWhen I put my face into it in the basin at Clongowes. Can\xe2\x80\x99t see! Who\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbehind me? Out quickly, quickly! Do you see the tide flowing quickly in\r\non all sides, sheeting the lows of sand quickly, shellcocoacoloured? If\r\nI had land under my feet. I want his life still to be his, mine to be\r\nmine. A drowning man. His human eyes scream to me out of horror of his\r\ndeath. I... With him together down... I could not save her. Waters:\r\nbitter death: lost.\r\n\r\nA woman and a man. I see her skirties. Pinned up, I bet.\r\n\r\nTheir dog ambled about a bank of dwindling sand, trotting, sniffing on\r\nall sides. Looking for something lost in a past life. Suddenly he made\r\noff like a bounding hare, ears flung back, chasing the shadow of a\r\nlowskimming gull. The man\xe2\x80\x99s shrieked whistle struck his limp ears. He\r\nturned, bounded back, came nearer, trotted on twinkling shanks. On a\r\nfield tenney a buck, trippant, proper, unattired. At the lacefringe of\r\nthe tide he halted with stiff forehoofs, seawardpointed ears. His\r\nsnout lifted barked at the wavenoise, herds of seamorse. They serpented\r\ntowards his feet, curling, unfurling many crests, every ninth, breaking,\r\nplashing, from far, from farther out, waves and waves.\r\n\r\nCocklepickers. They waded a little way in the water and, stooping,\r\nsoused their bags and, lifting them again, waded out. The dog yelped\r\nrunning to them, reared up and pawed them, dropping on all fours, again\r\nreared up at them with mute bearish fawning. Unheeded he kept by them as\r\nthey came towards the drier sand, a rag of wolf\xe2\x80\x99s tongue redpanting from\r\nhis jaws. His speckled body ambled ahead of them and then loped off at a\r\ncalf\xe2\x80\x99s gallop. The carcass lay on his path. He stopped, sniffed, stalked\r\nround it, brother, nosing closer, went round it, sniffling rapidly like\r\na dog all over the dead dog\xe2\x80\x99s bedraggled fell. Dogskull, dogsniff, eyes\r\non the ground, moves to one great goal. Ah, poor dogsbody! Here lies\r\npoor dogsbody\xe2\x80\x99s body.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Tatters! Out of that, you mongrel!\r\n\r\nThe cry brought him skulking back to his master and a blunt bootless\r\nkick sent him unscathed across a spit of sand, crouched in flight. He\r\nslunk back in a curve. Doesn\xe2\x80\x99t see me. Along by the edge of the mole he\r\nlolloped, dawdled, smelt a rock and from under a cocked hindleg pissed\r\nagainst it. He trotted forward and, lifting again his hindleg, pissed\r\nquick short at an unsmelt rock. The simple pleasures of the poor. His\r\nhindpaws then scattered the sand: then his forepaws dabbled and delved.\r\nSomething he buried there, his grandmother. He rooted in the sand,\r\ndabbling, delving and stopped to listen to the air, scraped up the sand\r\nagain with a fury of his claws, soon ceasing, a pard, a panther, got in\r\nspousebreach, vulturing the dead.\r\n\r\nAfter he woke me last night same dream or was it? Wait. Open hallway.\r\nStreet of harlots. Remember. Haroun al Raschid. I am almosting it. That\r\nman led me, spoke. I was not afraid. The melon he had he held against my\r\nface. Smiled: creamfruit smell. That was the rule, said. In. Come. Red\r\ncarpet spread. You will see who.\r\n\r\nShouldering their bags they trudged, the red Egyptians. His blued feet\r\nout of turnedup trousers slapped the clammy sand, a dull brick muffler\r\nstrangling his unshaven neck. With woman steps she followed: the\r\nruffian and his strolling mort. Spoils slung at her back. Loose sand and\r\nshellgrit crusted her bare feet. About her windraw face hair trailed.\r\nBehind her lord, his helpmate, bing awast to Romeville. When night hides\r\nher body\xe2\x80\x99s flaws calling under her brown shawl from an archway\r\nwhere dogs have mired. Her fancyman is treating two Royal Dublins in\r\nO\xe2\x80\x99Loughlin\xe2\x80\x99s of Blackpitts. Buss her, wap in rogues\xe2\x80\x99 rum lingo, for, O,\r\nmy dimber wapping dell! A shefiend\xe2\x80\x99s whiteness under her rancid rags.\r\nFumbally\xe2\x80\x99s lane that night: the tanyard smells.\r\n\r\n     White thy fambles, red thy gan\r\n     And thy quarrons dainty is.\r\n     Couch a hogshead with me then.\r\n     In the darkmans clip and kiss.\r\n\r\nMorose delectation Aquinas tunbelly calls this, frate porcospino.\r\nUnfallen Adam rode and not rutted. Call away let him: thy quarrons\r\ndainty is. Language no whit worse than his. Monkwords, marybeads jabber\r\non their girdles: roguewords, tough nuggets patter in their pockets.\r\n\r\nPassing now.\r\n\r\nA side eye at my Hamlet hat. If I were suddenly naked here as I sit? I\r\nam not. Across the sands of all the world, followed by the sun\xe2\x80\x99s flaming\r\nsword, to the west, trekking to evening lands. She trudges, schlepps,\r\ntrains, drags, trascines her load. A tide westering, moondrawn, in her\r\nwake. Tides, myriadislanded, within her, blood not mine, oinopa ponton,\r\na winedark sea. Behold the handmaid of the moon. In sleep the wet\r\nsign calls her hour, bids her rise. Bridebed, childbed, bed of death,\r\nghostcandled. Omnis caro ad te veniet. He comes, pale vampire, through\r\nstorm his eyes, his bat sails bloodying the sea, mouth to her mouth\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nkiss.\r\n\r\nHere. Put a pin in that chap, will you? My tablets. Mouth to her kiss.\r\nNo. Must be two of em. Glue em well. Mouth to her mouth\xe2\x80\x99s kiss.\r\n\r\nHis lips lipped and mouthed fleshless lips of air: mouth to her moomb.\r\nOomb, allwombing tomb. His mouth moulded issuing breath, unspeeched:\r\nooeeehah: roar of cataractic planets, globed, blazing, roaring\r\nwayawayawayawayaway. Paper. The banknotes, blast them. Old Deasy\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nletter. Here. Thanking you for the hospitality tear the blank end off.\r\nTurning his back to the sun he bent over far to a table of rock and\r\nscribbled words. That\xe2\x80\x99s twice I forgot to take slips from the library\r\ncounter.\r\n\r\nHis shadow lay over the rocks as he bent, ending. Why not endless till\r\nthe farthest star? Darkly they are there behind this light, darkness\r\nshining in the brightness, delta of Cassiopeia, worlds. Me sits there\r\nwith his augur\xe2\x80\x99s rod of ash, in borrowed sandals, by day beside a livid\r\nsea, unbeheld, in violet night walking beneath a reign of uncouth stars.\r\nI throw this ended shadow from me, manshape ineluctable, call it back.\r\nEndless, would it be mine, form of my form? Who watches me here? Who\r\never anywhere will read these written words? Signs on a white field.\r\nSomewhere to someone in your flutiest voice. The good bishop of Cloyne\r\ntook the veil of the temple out of his shovel hat: veil of space with\r\ncoloured emblems hatched on its field. Hold hard. Coloured on a flat:\r\nyes, that\xe2\x80\x99s right. Flat I see, then think distance, near, far, flat\r\nI see, east, back. Ah, see now! Falls back suddenly, frozen in\r\nstereoscope. Click does the trick. You find my words dark. Darkness is\r\nin our souls do you not think? Flutier. Our souls, shamewounded by our\r\nsins, cling to us yet more, a woman to her lover clinging, the more the\r\nmore.\r\n\r\nShe trusts me, her hand gentle, the longlashed eyes. Now where the blue\r\nhell am I bringing her beyond the veil? Into the ineluctable modality of\r\nthe ineluctable visuality. She, she, she. What she? The virgin at Hodges\r\nFiggis\xe2\x80\x99 window on Monday looking in for one of the alphabet books you\r\nwere going to write. Keen glance you gave her. Wrist through the\r\nbraided jesse of her sunshade. She lives in Leeson park with a grief\r\nand kickshaws, a lady of letters. Talk that to someone else, Stevie: a\r\npickmeup. Bet she wears those curse of God stays suspenders and\r\nyellow stockings, darned with lumpy wool. Talk about apple dumplings,\r\npiuttosto. Where are your wits?\r\n\r\nTouch me. Soft eyes. Soft soft soft hand. I am lonely here. O, touch me\r\nsoon, now. What is that word known to all men? I am quiet here alone.\r\nSad too. Touch, touch me.\r\n\r\nHe lay back at full stretch over the sharp rocks, cramming the scribbled\r\nnote and pencil into a pocket, his hat tilted down on his eyes. That\r\nis Kevin Egan\xe2\x80\x99s movement I made, nodding for his nap, sabbath sleep. Et\r\nvidit Deus. Et erant valde bona. Alo! Bonjour. Welcome as the flowers\r\nin May. Under its leaf he watched through peacocktwittering lashes the\r\nsouthing sun. I am caught in this burning scene. Pan\xe2\x80\x99s hour, the faunal\r\nnoon. Among gumheavy serpentplants, milkoozing fruits, where on the\r\ntawny waters leaves lie wide. Pain is far.\r\n\r\n     And no more turn aside and brood.\r\n\r\nHis gaze brooded on his broadtoed boots, a buck\xe2\x80\x99s castoffs,\r\nnebeneinander. He counted the creases of rucked leather wherein\r\nanother\xe2\x80\x99s foot had nested warm. The foot that beat the ground in\r\ntripudium, foot I dislove. But you were delighted when Esther Osvalt\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nshoe went on you: girl I knew in Paris. Tiens, quel petit pied! Staunch\r\nfriend, a brother soul: Wilde\xe2\x80\x99s love that dare not speak its name. His\r\narm: Cranly\xe2\x80\x99s arm. He now will leave me. And the blame? As I am. As I\r\nam. All or not at all.\r\n\r\nIn long lassoes from the Cock lake the water flowed full, covering\r\ngreengoldenly lagoons of sand, rising, flowing. My ashplant will float\r\naway. I shall wait. No, they will pass on, passing, chafing against the\r\nlow rocks, swirling, passing. Better get this job over quick. Listen: a\r\nfourworded wavespeech: seesoo, hrss, rsseeiss, ooos. Vehement breath of\r\nwaters amid seasnakes, rearing horses, rocks. In cups of rocks it slops:\r\nflop, slop, slap: bounded in barrels. And, spent, its speech ceases. It\r\nflows purling, widely flowing, floating foampool, flower unfurling.\r\n\r\nUnder the upswelling tide he saw the writhing weeds lift languidly and\r\nsway reluctant arms, hising up their petticoats, in whispering water\r\nswaying and upturning coy silver fronds. Day by day: night by night:\r\nlifted, flooded and let fall. Lord, they are weary; and, whispered to,\r\nthey sigh. Saint Ambrose heard it, sigh of leaves and waves, waiting,\r\nawaiting the fullness of their times, diebus ac noctibus iniurias\r\npatiens ingemiscit. To no end gathered; vainly then released,\r\nforthflowing, wending back: loom of the moon. Weary too in sight of\r\nlovers, lascivious men, a naked woman shining in her courts, she draws a\r\ntoil of waters.\r\n\r\nFive fathoms out there. Full fathom five thy father lies. At one, he\r\nsaid. Found drowned. High water at Dublin bar. Driving before it a loose\r\ndrift of rubble, fanshoals of fishes, silly shells. A corpse rising\r\nsaltwhite from the undertow, bobbing a pace a pace a porpoise landward.\r\nThere he is. Hook it quick. Pull. Sunk though he be beneath the watery\r\nfloor. We have him. Easy now.\r\n\r\nBag of corpsegas sopping in foul brine. A quiver of minnows, fat of a\r\nspongy titbit, flash through the slits of his buttoned trouserfly.\r\nGod becomes man becomes fish becomes barnacle goose becomes featherbed\r\nmountain. Dead breaths I living breathe, tread dead dust, devour a\r\nurinous offal from all dead. Hauled stark over the gunwale he breathes\r\nupward the stench of his green grave, his leprous nosehole snoring to\r\nthe sun.\r\n\r\nA seachange this, brown eyes saltblue. Seadeath, mildest of all deaths\r\nknown to man. Old Father Ocean. Prix de Paris: beware of imitations.\r\nJust you give it a fair trial. We enjoyed ourselves immensely.\r\n\r\nCome. I thirst. Clouding over. No black clouds anywhere, are there?\r\nThunderstorm. Allbright he falls, proud lightning of the intellect,\r\nLucifer, dico, qui nescit occasum. No. My cockle hat and staff and hismy\r\nsandal shoon. Where? To evening lands. Evening will find itself.\r\n\r\nHe took the hilt of his ashplant, lunging with it softly, dallying\r\nstill. Yes, evening will find itself in me, without me. All days make\r\ntheir end. By the way next when is it Tuesday will be the longest\r\nday. Of all the glad new year, mother, the rum tum tiddledy tum. Lawn\r\nTennyson, gentleman poet. Gi\xc3\xa0. For the old hag with the yellow teeth.\r\nAnd Monsieur Drumont, gentleman journalist. Gi\xc3\xa0. My teeth are very bad.\r\nWhy, I wonder. Feel. That one is going too. Shells. Ought I go to a\r\ndentist, I wonder, with that money? That one. This. Toothless Kinch, the\r\nsuperman. Why is that, I wonder, or does it mean something perhaps?\r\n\r\nMy handkerchief. He threw it. I remember. Did I not take it up?\r\n\r\nHis hand groped vainly in his pockets. No, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t. Better buy one.\r\n\r\nHe laid the dry snot picked from his nostril on a ledge of rock,\r\ncarefully. For the rest let look who will.\r\n\r\nBehind. Perhaps there is someone.\r\n\r\nHe turned his face over a shoulder, rere regardant. Moving through the\r\nair high spars of a threemaster, her sails brailed up on the crosstrees,\r\nhoming, upstream, silently moving, a silent ship.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94 II \xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[ 4 ]\r\n\r\nMr Leopold Bloom ate with relish the inner organs of beasts and fowls.\r\nHe liked thick giblet soup, nutty gizzards, a stuffed roast heart,\r\nliverslices fried with crustcrumbs, fried hencods\xe2\x80\x99 roes. Most of all\r\nhe liked grilled mutton kidneys which gave to his palate a fine tang of\r\nfaintly scented urine.\r\n\r\nKidneys were in his mind as he moved about the kitchen softly, righting\r\nher breakfast things on the humpy tray. Gelid light and air were in the\r\nkitchen but out of doors gentle summer morning everywhere. Made him feel\r\na bit peckish.\r\n\r\nThe coals were reddening.\r\n\r\nAnother slice of bread and butter: three, four: right. She didn\xe2\x80\x99t like\r\nher plate full. Right. He turned from the tray, lifted the kettle off\r\nthe hob and set it sideways on the fire. It sat there, dull and squat,\r\nits spout stuck out. Cup of tea soon. Good. Mouth dry. The cat walked\r\nstiffly round a leg of the table with tail on high.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Mkgnao!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94O, there you are, Mr Bloom said, turning from the fire.\r\n\r\nThe cat mewed in answer and stalked again stiffly round a leg of the\r\ntable, mewing. Just how she stalks over my writingtable. Prr. Scratch my\r\nhead. Prr.\r\n\r\nMr Bloom watched curiously, kindly the lithe black form. Clean to see:\r\nthe gloss of her sleek hide, the white button under the butt of her\r\ntail, the green flashing eyes. He bent down to her, his hands on his\r\nknees.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Milk for the pussens, he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Mrkgnao! the cat cried.\r\n\r\nThey call them stupid. They understand what we say better than we\r\nunderstand them. She understands all she wants to. Vindictive too.\r\nCruel. Her nature. Curious mice never squeal. Seem to like it. Wonder\r\nwhat I look like to her. Height of a tower? No, she can jump me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Afraid of the chickens she is, he said mockingly. Afraid of the\r\nchookchooks. I never saw such a stupid pussens as the pussens.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Mrkrgnao! the cat said loudly.\r\n\r\nShe blinked up out of her avid shameclosing eyes, mewing plaintively\r\nand long, showing him her milkwhite teeth. He watched the dark eyeslits\r\nnarrowing with greed till her eyes were green stones. Then he went to\r\nthe dresser, took the jug Hanlon\xe2\x80\x99s milkman had just filled for him,\r\npoured warmbubbled milk on a saucer and set it slowly on the floor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Gurrhr! she cried, running to lap.\r\n\r\nHe watched the bristles shining wirily in the weak light as she tipped\r\nthree times and licked lightly. Wonder is it true if you clip them they\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t mouse after. Why? They shine in the dark, perhaps, the tips. Or\r\nkind of feelers in the dark, perhaps.\r\n\r\nHe listened to her licking lap. Ham and eggs, no. No good eggs with this\r\ndrouth. Want pure fresh water. Thursday: not a good day either for a\r\nmutton kidney at Buckley\xe2\x80\x99s. Fried with butter, a shake of pepper. Better\r\na pork kidney at Dlugacz\xe2\x80\x99s. While the kettle is boiling. She lapped\r\nslower, then licking the saucer clean. Why are their tongues so rough?\r\nTo lap better, all porous holes. Nothing she can eat? He glanced round\r\nhim. No.\r\n\r\nOn quietly creaky boots he went up the staircase to the hall, paused by\r\nthe bedroom door. She might like something tasty. Thin bread and butter\r\nshe likes in the morning. Still perhaps: once in a way.\r\n\r\nHe said softly in the bare hall:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99m going round the corner. Be back in a minute.\r\n\r\nAnd when he had heard his voice say it he added:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94You don\xe2\x80\x99t want anything for breakfast?\r\n\r\nA sleepy soft grunt answered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Mn.\r\n\r\nNo. She didn\xe2\x80\x99t want anything. He heard then a warm heavy sigh, softer,\r\nas she turned over and the loose brass quoits of the bedstead jingled.\r\nMust get those settled really. Pity. All the way from Gibraltar.\r\nForgotten any little Spanish she knew. Wonder what her father gave for\r\nit. Old style. Ah yes! of course. Bought it at the governor\xe2\x80\x99s auction.\r\nGot a short knock. Hard as nails at a bargain, old Tweedy. Yes, sir. At\r\nPlevna that was. I rose from the ranks, sir, and I\xe2\x80\x99m proud of it.\r\nStill he had brains enough to make that corner in stamps. Now that was\r\nfarseeing.\r\n\r\nHis hand took his hat from the peg over his initialled heavy overcoat\r\nand his lost property office secondhand waterproof. Stamps: stickyback\r\npictures. Daresay lots of officers are in the swim too. Course they do.\r\nThe sweated legend in the crown of his hat told him mutely: Plasto\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhigh grade ha. He peeped quickly inside the leather headband. White slip\r\nof paper. Quite safe.\r\n\r\nOn the doorstep he felt in his hip pocket for the latchkey. Not there.\r\nIn the trousers I left off. Must get it. Potato I have. Creaky wardrobe.\r\nNo use disturbing her. She turned over sleepily that time. He pulled\r\nthe halldoor to after him very quietly, more, till the footleaf dropped\r\ngently over the threshold, a limp lid. Looked shut. All right till I\r\ncome back anyhow.\r\n\r\nHe crossed to the bright side, avoiding the loose cellarflap of number\r\nseventyfive. The sun was nearing the steeple of George\xe2\x80\x99s church. Be a\r\nwarm day I fancy. Specially in these black clothes feel it more. Black\r\nconducts, reflects, (refracts is it?), the heat. But I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t go in\r\nthat light suit. Make a picnic of it. His eyelids sank quietly often as\r\nhe walked in happy warmth. Boland\xe2\x80\x99s breadvan delivering with trays our\r\ndaily but she prefers yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s loaves turnovers crisp crowns hot.\r\nMakes you feel young. Somewhere in the east: early morning: set off at\r\ndawn. Travel round in front of the sun, steal a day\xe2\x80\x99s march on him. Keep\r\nit up for ever never grow a day older technically. Walk along a strand,\r\nstrange land, come to a city gate, sentry there, old ranker too, old\r\nTweedy\xe2\x80\x99s big moustaches, leaning on a long kind of a spear. Wander\r\nthrough awned streets. Turbaned faces going by. Dark caves of carpet\r\nshops, big man, Turko the terrible, seated crosslegged, smoking a coiled\r\npipe. Cries of sellers in the streets. Drink water scented with fennel,\r\nsherbet. Dander along all day. Might meet a robber or two. Well,\r\nmeet him. Getting on to sundown. The shadows of the mosques among the\r\npillars: priest with a scroll rolled up. A shiver of the trees, signal,\r\nthe evening wind. I pass on. Fading gold sky. A mother watches me from\r\nher doorway. She calls her children home in their dark language. High\r\nwall: beyond strings twanged. Night sky, moon, violet, colour of Molly\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nnew garters. Strings. Listen. A girl playing one of those instruments\r\nwhat do you call them: dulcimers. I pass.\r\n\r\nProbably not a bit like it really. Kind of stuff you read: in the track\r\nof the sun. Sunburst on the titlepage. He smiled, pleasing himself.\r\nWhat Arthur Griffith said about the headpiece over the Freeman leader: a\r\nhomerule sun rising up in the northwest from the laneway behind the bank\r\nof Ireland. He prolonged his pleased smile. Ikey touch that: homerule\r\nsun rising up in the northwest.\r\n\r\nHe approached Larry O\xe2\x80\x99Rourke\xe2\x80\x99s. From the cellar grating floated up the\r\nflabby gush of porter. Through the open doorway the bar squirted out\r\nwhiffs of ginger, teadust, biscuitmush. Good house, however: just the\r\nend of the city traffic. For instance M\xe2\x80\x99Auley\xe2\x80\x99s down there: n. g. as\r\nposition. Of course if they ran a tramline along the North Circular from\r\nthe cattlemarket to the quays value would go up like a shot.\r\n\r\nBaldhead over the blind. Cute old codger. No use canvassing him for an\r\nad. Still he knows his own business best. There he is, sure enough, my\r\nbold Larry, leaning against the sugarbin in his shirtsleeves watching\r\nthe aproned curate swab up with mop and bucket. Simon Dedalus takes him\r\noff to a tee with his eyes screwed up. Do you know what I\xe2\x80\x99m going to\r\ntell you? What\xe2\x80\x99s that, Mr O\xe2\x80\x99Rourke? Do you know what? The Russians,\r\nthey\xe2\x80\x99d only be an eight o\xe2\x80\x99clock breakfast for the Japanese.\r\n\r\nStop and say a word: about the funeral perhaps. Sad thing about poor\r\nDignam, Mr O\xe2\x80\x99Rourke.\r\n\r\nTurning into Dorset street he said freshly in greeting through the\r\ndoorway:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Good day, Mr O\xe2\x80\x99Rourke.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Good day to you.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Lovely weather, sir.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98Tis all that.\r\n\r\nWhere do they get the money? Coming up redheaded curates from the county\r\nLeitrim, rinsing empties and old man in the cellar. Then, lo and behold,\r\nthey blossom out as Adam Findlaters or Dan Tallons. Then think of the\r\ncompetition. General thirst. Good puzzle would be cross Dublin without\r\npassing a pub. Save it they can\xe2\x80\x99t. Off the drunks perhaps. Put down\r\nthree and carry five. What is that, a bob here and there, dribs and\r\ndrabs. On the wholesale orders perhaps. Doing a double shuffle with the\r\ntown travellers. Square it you with the boss and we\xe2\x80\x99ll split the job,\r\nsee?\r\n\r\nHow much would that tot to off the porter in the month? Say ten barrels\r\nof stuff. Say he got ten per cent off. O more. Fifteen. He passed Saint\r\nJoseph\xe2\x80\x99s National school. Brats\xe2\x80\x99 clamour. Windows open. Fresh air\r\nhelps memory. Or a lilt. Ahbeesee defeegee kelomen opeecue rustyouvee\r\ndoubleyou. Boys are they? Yes. Inishturk. Inishark. Inishboffin. At\r\ntheir joggerfry. Mine. Slieve Bloom.\r\n\r\nHe halted before Dlugacz\xe2\x80\x99s window, staring at the hanks of sausages,\r\npolonies, black and white. Fifteen multiplied by. The figures whitened\r\nin his mind, unsolved: displeased, he let them fade. The shiny links,\r\npacked with forcemeat, fed his gaze and he breathed in tranquilly the\r\nlukewarm breath of cooked spicy pigs\xe2\x80\x99 blood.\r\n\r\nA kidney oozed bloodgouts on the willowpatterned dish: the last. He\r\nstood by the nextdoor girl at the counter. Would she buy it too, calling\r\nthe items from a slip in her hand? Chapped: washingsoda. And a pound and\r\na half of Denny\xe2\x80\x99s sausages. His eyes rested on her vigorous hips.\r\nWoods his name is. Wonder what he does. Wife is oldish. New blood.\r\nNo followers allowed. Strong pair of arms. Whacking a carpet on the\r\nclothesline. She does whack it, by George. The way her crooked skirt\r\nswings at each whack.\r\n\r\nThe ferreteyed porkbutcher folded the sausages he had snipped off with\r\nblotchy fingers, sausagepink. Sound meat there: like a stallfed heifer.\r\n\r\nHe took a page up from the pile of cut sheets: the model farm at\r\nKinnereth on the lakeshore of Tiberias. Can become ideal winter\r\nsanatorium. Moses Montefiore. I thought he was. Farmhouse, wall round\r\nit, blurred cattle cropping. He held the page from him: interesting:\r\nread it nearer, the title, the blurred cropping cattle, the page\r\nrustling. A young white heifer. Those mornings in the cattlemarket, the\r\nbeasts lowing in their pens, branded sheep, flop and fall of dung, the\r\nbreeders in hobnailed boots trudging through the litter, slapping a palm\r\non a ripemeated hindquarter, there\xe2\x80\x99s a prime one, unpeeled switches in\r\ntheir hands. He held the page aslant patiently, bending his senses and\r\nhis will, his soft subject gaze at rest. The crooked skirt swinging,\r\nwhack by whack by whack.\r\n\r\nThe porkbutcher snapped two sheets from the pile, wrapped up her prime\r\nsausages and made a red grimace.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Now, my miss, he said.\r\n\r\nShe tendered a coin, smiling boldly, holding her thick wrist out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Thank you, my miss. And one shilling threepence change. For you,\r\nplease?\r\n\r\nMr Bloom pointed quickly. To catch up and walk behind her if she went\r\nslowly, behind her moving hams. Pleasant to see first thing in the\r\nmorning. Hurry up, damn it. Make hay while the sun shines. She stood\r\noutside the shop in sunlight and sauntered lazily to the right. He\r\nsighed down his nose: they never understand. Sodachapped hands. Crusted\r\ntoenails too. Brown scapulars in tatters, defending her both ways.\r\nThe sting of disregard glowed to weak pleasure within his breast. For\r\nanother: a constable off duty cuddling her in Eccles\xe2\x80\x99 Lane. They like\r\nthem sizeable. Prime sausage. O please, Mr Policeman, I\xe2\x80\x99m lost in the\r\nwood.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Threepence, please.\r\n\r\nHis hand accepted the moist tender gland and slid it into a sidepocket.\r\nThen it fetched up three coins from his trousers\xe2\x80\x99 pocket and laid them\r\non the rubber prickles. They lay, were read quickly and quickly slid,\r\ndisc by disc, into the till.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Thank you, sir. Another time.\r\n\r\nA speck of eager fire from foxeyes thanked him. He withdrew his gaze\r\nafter an instant. No: better not: another time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Good morning, he said, moving away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Good morning, sir.\r\n\r\nNo sign. Gone. What matter?\r\n\r\nHe walked back along Dorset street, reading gravely. Agendath Netaim:\r\nplanters\xe2\x80\x99 company. To purchase waste sandy tracts from Turkish\r\ngovernment and plant with eucalyptus trees. Excellent for shade, fuel\r\nand construction. Orangegroves and immense melonfields north of Jaffa.\r\nYou pay eighty marks and they plant a dunam of land for you with olives,\r\noranges, almonds or citrons. Olives cheaper: oranges need artificial\r\nirrigation. Every year you get a sending of the crop. Your name entered\r\nfor life as owner in the book of the union. Can pay ten down and the\r\nbalance in yearly instalments. Bleibtreustrasse 34, Berlin, W. 15.\r\n\r\nNothing doing. Still an idea behind it.\r\n\r\nHe looked at the cattle, blurred in silver heat. Silverpowdered\r\nolivetrees. Quiet long days: pruning, ripening. Olives are packed in\r\njars, eh? I have a few left from Andrews. Molly spitting them out. Knows\r\nthe taste of them now. Oranges in tissue paper packed in crates. Citrons\r\ntoo. Wonder is poor Citron still in Saint Kevin\xe2\x80\x99s parade. And Mastiansky\r\nwith the old cither. Pleasant evenings we had then. Molly in Citron\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbasketchair. Nice to hold, cool waxen fruit, hold in the hand, lift it\r\nto the nostrils and smell the perfume. Like that, heavy, sweet, wild\r\nperfume. Always the same, year after year. They fetched high prices too,\r\nMoisel told me. Arbutus place: Pleasants street: pleasant old times.\r\nMust be without a flaw, he said. Coming all that way: Spain, Gibraltar,\r\nMediterranean, the Levant. Crates lined up on the quayside at Jaffa,\r\nchap ticking them off in a book, navvies handling them barefoot in\r\nsoiled dungarees. There\xe2\x80\x99s whatdoyoucallhim out of. How do you? Doesn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nsee. Chap you know just to salute bit of a bore. His back is like that\r\nNorwegian captain\xe2\x80\x99s. Wonder if I\xe2\x80\x99ll meet him today. Watering cart. To\r\nprovoke the rain. On earth as it is in heaven.\r\n\r\nA cloud began to cover the sun slowly, wholly. Grey. Far.\r\n\r\nNo, not like that. A barren land, bare waste. Vulcanic lake, the dead\r\nsea: no fish, weedless, sunk deep in the earth. No wind could lift those\r\nwaves, grey metal, poisonous foggy waters. Brimstone they called it\r\nraining down: the cities of the plain: Sodom, Gomorrah, Edom. All dead\r\nnames. A dead sea in a dead land, grey and old. Old now. It bore the\r\noldest, the first race. A bent hag crossed from Cassidy\xe2\x80\x99s, clutching a\r\nnaggin bottle by the neck. The oldest people. Wandered far away over\r\nall the earth, captivity to captivity, multiplying, dying, being born\r\neverywhere. It lay there now. Now it could bear no more. Dead: an old\r\nwoman\xe2\x80\x99s: the grey sunken cunt of the world.\r\n\r\nDesolation.\r\n\r\nGrey horror seared his flesh. Folding the page into his pocket he turned\r\ninto Eccles street, hurrying homeward. Cold oils slid along his veins,\r\nchilling his blood: age crusting him with a salt cloak. Well, I am here\r\nnow. Yes, I am here now. Morning mouth bad images. Got up wrong side of\r\nthe bed. Must begin again those Sandow\xe2\x80\x99s exercises. On the hands down.\r\nBlotchy brown brick houses. Number eighty still unlet. Why is that?\r\nValuation is only twentyeight. Towers, Battersby, North, MacArthur:\r\nparlour windows plastered with bills. Plasters on a sore eye. To smell\r\nthe gentle smoke of tea, fume of the pan, sizzling butter. Be near her\r\nample bedwarmed flesh. Yes, yes.\r\n\r\nQuick warm sunlight came running from Berkeley road, swiftly, in slim\r\nsandals, along the brightening footpath. Runs, she runs to meet me, a\r\ngirl with gold hair on the wind.\r\n\r\nTwo letters and a card lay on the hallfloor. He stooped and gathered\r\nthem. Mrs Marion Bloom. His quickened heart slowed at once. Bold hand.\r\nMrs Marion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Poldy!\r\n\r\nEntering the bedroom he halfclosed his eyes and walked through warm\r\nyellow twilight towards her tousled head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Who are the letters for?\r\n\r\nHe looked at them. Mullingar. Milly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94A letter for me from Milly, he said carefully, and a card to you. And a\r\nletter for you.\r\n\r\nHe laid her card and letter on the twill bedspread near the curve of her\r\nknees.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Do you want the blind up?\r\n\r\nLetting the blind up by gentle tugs halfway his backward eye saw her\r\nglance at the letter and tuck it under her pillow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94That do? he asked, turning.\r\n\r\nShe was reading the card, propped on her elbow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94She got the things, she said.\r\n\r\nHe waited till she had laid the card aside and curled herself back\r\nslowly with a snug sigh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Hurry up with that tea, she said. I\xe2\x80\x99m parched.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94The kettle is boiling, he said.\r\n\r\nBut he delayed to clear the chair: her striped petticoat, tossed soiled\r\nlinen: and lifted all in an armful on to the foot of the bed.\r\n\r\nAs he went down the kitchen stairs she called:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Poldy!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94What?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Scald the teapot.\r\n\r\nOn the boil sure enough: a plume of steam from the spout. He scalded and\r\nrinsed out the teapot and put in four full spoons of tea, tilting the\r\nkettle then to let the water flow in. Having set it to draw he took off\r\nthe kettle, crushed the pan flat on the live coals and watched the lump\r\nof butter slide and melt. While he unwrapped the kidney the cat mewed\r\nhungrily against him. Give her too much meat she won\xe2\x80\x99t mouse. Say they\r\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t eat pork. Kosher. Here. He let the bloodsmeared paper fall to\r\nher and dropped the kidney amid the sizzling butter sauce. Pepper. He\r\nsprinkled it through his fingers ringwise from the chipped eggcup.\r\n\r\nThen he slit open his letter, glancing down the page and over. Thanks:\r\nnew tam: Mr Coghlan: lough Owel picnic: young student: Blazes Boylan\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nseaside girls.\r\n\r\nThe tea was drawn. He filled his own moustachecup, sham crown Derby,\r\nsmiling. Silly Milly\xe2\x80\x99s birthday gift. Only five she was then. No, wait:\r\nfour. I gave her the amberoid necklace she broke. Putting pieces of\r\nfolded brown paper in the letterbox for her. He smiled, pouring.\r\n\r\n     O, Milly Bloom, you are my darling.\r\n     You are my lookingglass from night to morning.\r\n     I\xe2\x80\x99d rather have you without a farthing\r\n     Than Katey Keogh with her ass and garden.\r\n\r\nPoor old professor Goodwin. Dreadful old case. Still he was a courteous\r\nold chap. Oldfashioned way he used to bow Molly off the platform. And\r\nthe little mirror in his silk hat. The night Milly brought it into\r\nthe parlour. O, look what I found in professor Goodwin\xe2\x80\x99s hat! All we\r\nlaughed. Sex breaking out even then. Pert little piece she was.\r\n\r\nHe prodded a fork into the kidney and slapped it over: then fitted the\r\nteapot on the tray. Its hump bumped as he took it up. Everything on\r\nit? Bread and butter, four, sugar, spoon, her cream. Yes. He carried it\r\nupstairs, his thumb hooked in the teapot handle.\r\n\r\nNudging the door open with his knee he carried the tray in and set it on\r\nthe chair by the bedhead.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94What a time you were! she said.\r\n\r\nShe set the brasses jingling as she raised herself briskly, an elbow on\r\nthe pillow. He looked calmly down on her bulk and between her large soft\r\nbubs, sloping within her nightdress like a shegoat\xe2\x80\x99s udder. The warmth\r\nof her couched body rose on the air, mingling with the fragrance of the\r\ntea she poured.\r\n\r\nA strip of torn envelope peeped from under the dimpled pillow. In the\r\nact of going he stayed to straighten the bedspread.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Who was the letter from? he asked.\r\n\r\nBold hand. Marion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94O, Boylan, she said. He\xe2\x80\x99s bringing the programme.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94What are you singing?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94L\xc3\xa0 ci darem with J. C. Doyle, she said, and Love\xe2\x80\x99s Old Sweet Song.\r\n\r\nHer full lips, drinking, smiled. Rather stale smell that incense leaves\r\nnext day. Like foul flowerwater.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Would you like the window open a little?\r\n\r\nShe doubled a slice of bread into her mouth, asking:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94What time is the funeral?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Eleven, I think, he answered. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t see the paper.\r\n\r\nFollowing the pointing of her finger he took up a leg of her soiled\r\ndrawers from the bed. No? Then, a twisted grey garter looped round a\r\nstocking: rumpled, shiny sole.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94No: that book.\r\n\r\nOther stocking. Her petticoat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94It must have fell down, she said.\r\n\r\nHe felt here and there. Voglio e non vorrei. Wonder if she pronounces\r\nthat right: voglio. Not in the bed. Must have slid down. He stooped and\r\nlifted the valance. The book, fallen, sprawled against the bulge of the\r\norangekeyed chamberpot.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Show here, she said. I put a mark in it. There\xe2\x80\x99s a word I wanted to ask\r\nyou.\r\n\r\nShe swallowed a draught of tea from her cup held by nothandle and,\r\nhaving wiped her fingertips smartly on the blanket, began to search the\r\ntext with the hairpin till she reached the word.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Met him what? he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Here, she said. What does that mean?\r\n\r\nHe leaned downward and read near her polished thumbnail.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Metempsychosis?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Yes. Who\xe2\x80\x99s he when he\xe2\x80\x99s at home?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Metempsychosis, he said, frowning. It\xe2\x80\x99s Greek: from the Greek. That\r\nmeans the transmigration of souls.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94O, rocks! she said. Tell us in plain words.\r\n\r\nHe smiled, glancing askance at her mocking eyes. The same young eyes.\r\nThe first night after the charades. Dolphin\xe2\x80\x99s Barn. He turned over the\r\nsmudged pages. Ruby: the Pride of the Ring. Hello. Illustration. Fierce\r\nItalian with carriagewhip. Must be Ruby pride of the on the floor naked.\r\nSheet kindly lent. The monster Maffei desisted and flung his victim\r\nfrom him with an oath. Cruelty behind it all. Doped animals. Trapeze at\r\nHengler\xe2\x80\x99s. Had to look the other way. Mob gaping. Break your neck\r\nand we\xe2\x80\x99ll break our sides. Families of them. Bone them young so they\r\nmetamspychosis. That we live after death. Our souls. That a man\xe2\x80\x99s soul\r\nafter he dies. Dignam\xe2\x80\x99s soul...\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Did you finish it? he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Yes, she said. There\xe2\x80\x99s nothing smutty in it. Is she in love with the\r\nfirst fellow all the time?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Never read it. Do you want another?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Yes. Get another of Paul de Kock\xe2\x80\x99s. Nice name he has.\r\n\r\nShe poured more tea into her cup, watching it flow sideways.\r\n\r\nMust get that Capel street library book renewed or they\xe2\x80\x99ll write to\r\nKearney, my guarantor. Reincarnation: that\xe2\x80\x99s the word.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Some people believe, he said, that we go on living in another body\r\nafter death, that we lived before. They call it reincarnation. That\r\nwe all lived before on the earth thousands of years ago or some other\r\nplanet. They say we have forgotten it. Some say they remember their past\r\nlives.\r\n\r\nThe sluggish cream wound curdling spirals through her tea. Better remind\r\nher of the word: metempsychosis. An example would be better. An example?\r\n\r\nThe Bath of the Nymph over the bed. Given away with the Easter number of\r\nPhoto Bits: Splendid masterpiece in art colours. Tea before you put milk\r\nin. Not unlike her with her hair down: slimmer. Three and six I gave\r\nfor the frame. She said it would look nice over the bed. Naked nymphs:\r\nGreece: and for instance all the people that lived then.\r\n\r\nHe turned the pages back.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Metempsychosis, he said, is what the ancient Greeks called it. They\r\nused to believe you could be changed into an animal or a tree, for\r\ninstance. What they called nymphs, for example.\r\n\r\nHer spoon ceased to stir up the sugar. She gazed straight before her,\r\ninhaling through her arched nostrils.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94There\xe2\x80\x99s a smell of burn, she said. Did you leave anything on the fire?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94The kidney! he cried suddenly.\r\n\r\nHe fitted the book roughly into his inner pocket and, stubbing his toes\r\nagainst the broken commode, hurried out towards the smell, stepping\r\nhastily down the stairs with a flurried stork\xe2\x80\x99s legs. Pungent smoke shot\r\nup in an angry jet from a side of the pan. By prodding a prong of the\r\nfork under the kidney he detached it and turned it turtle on its back.\r\nOnly a little burnt. He tossed it off the pan on to a plate and let the\r\nscanty brown gravy trickle over it.\r\n\r\nCup of tea now. He sat down, cut and buttered a slice of the loaf.\r\nHe shore away the burnt flesh and flung it to the cat. Then he put a\r\nforkful into his mouth, chewing with discernment the toothsome pliant\r\nmeat. Done to a turn. A mouthful of tea. Then he cut away dies of bread,\r\nsopped one in the gravy and put it in his mouth. What was that about\r\nsome young student and a picnic? He creased out the letter at his side,\r\nreading it slowly as he chewed, sopping another die of bread in the\r\ngravy and raising it to his mouth.\r\n\r\nDearest Papli\r\n\r\nThanks ever so much for the lovely birthday present. It suits me\r\nsplendid. Everyone says I am quite the belle in my new tam. I got\r\nmummy\xe2\x80\x99s lovely box of creams and am writing. They are lovely. I am\r\ngetting on swimming in the photo business now. Mr Coghlan took one of me\r\nand Mrs. Will send when developed. We did great biz yesterday. Fair day\r\nand all the beef to the heels were in. We are going to lough Owel on\r\nMonday with a few friends to make a scrap picnic. Give my love to\r\nmummy and to yourself a big kiss and thanks. I hear them at the piano\r\ndownstairs. There is to be a concert in the Greville Arms on Saturday.\r\nThere is a young student comes here some evenings named Bannon his\r\ncousins or something are big swells and he sings Boylan\xe2\x80\x99s (I was on the\r\npop of writing Blazes Boylan\xe2\x80\x99s) song about those seaside girls. Tell him\r\nsilly Milly sends my best respects. I must now close with fondest love\r\n\r\nYour fond daughter\r\n\r\nMilly\r\n\r\nP. S. Excuse bad writing am in hurry. Byby.\r\n\r\nM.\r\n\r\nFifteen yesterday. Curious, fifteenth of the month too. Her first\r\nbirthday away from home. Separation. Remember the summer morning she\r\nwas born, running to knock up Mrs Thornton in Denzille street. Jolly old\r\nwoman. Lot of babies she must have helped into the world. She knew from\r\nthe first poor little Rudy wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t live. Well, God is good, sir. She\r\nknew at once. He would be eleven now if he had lived.\r\n\r\nHis vacant face stared pityingly at the postscript. Excuse bad writing.\r\nHurry. Piano downstairs. Coming out of her shell. Row with her in the\r\nXL Caf\xc3\xa9 about the bracelet. Wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t eat her cakes or speak or look.\r\nSaucebox. He sopped other dies of bread in the gravy and ate piece after\r\npiece of kidney. Twelve and six a week. Not much. Still, she might do\r\nworse. Music hall stage. Young student. He drank a draught of cooler tea\r\nto wash down his meal. Then he read the letter again: twice.\r\n\r\nO, well: she knows how to mind herself. But if not? No, nothing has\r\nhappened. Of course it might. Wait in any case till it does. A wild\r\npiece of goods. Her slim legs running up the staircase. Destiny.\r\nRipening now. Vain: very.\r\n\r\nHe smiled with troubled affection at the kitchen window. Day I caught\r\nher in the street pinching her cheeks to make them red. Anemic a little.\r\nWas given milk too long. On the Erin\xe2\x80\x99s King that day round the Kish.\r\nDamned old tub pitching about. Not a bit funky. Her pale blue scarf\r\nloose in the wind with her hair.\r\n\r\n     All dimpled cheeks and curls,\r\n     Your head it simply swirls.\r\n\r\n\r\nSeaside girls. Torn envelope. Hands stuck in his trousers\xe2\x80\x99 pockets,\r\njarvey off for the day, singing. Friend of the family. Swurls, he says.\r\nPier with lamps, summer evening, band.\r\n\r\n     Those girls, those girls,\r\n     Those lovely seaside girls.\r\n\r\nMilly too. Young kisses: the first. Far away now past. Mrs Marion.\r\nReading, lying back now, counting the strands of her hair, smiling,\r\nbraiding.\r\n\r\nA soft qualm, regret, flowed down his backbone, increasing. Will happen,\r\nyes. Prevent. Useless: can\xe2\x80\x99t move. Girl\xe2\x80\x99s sweet light lips. Will happen\r\ntoo. He felt the flowing qualm spread over him. Useless to move now.\r\nLips kissed, kissing, kissed. Full gluey woman\xe2\x80\x99s lips.\r\n\r\nBetter where she is down there: away. Occupy her. Wanted a dog to pass\r\nthe time. Might take a trip down there. August bank holiday, only two\r\nand six return. Six weeks off, however. Might work a press pass. Or\r\nthrough M\xe2\x80\x99Coy.\r\n\r\nThe cat, having cleaned all her fur, returned to the meatstained paper,\r\nnosed at it and stalked to the door. She looked back at him, mewing.\r\nWants to go out. Wait before a door sometime it will open. Let her wait.\r\nHas the fidgets. Electric. Thunder in the air. Was washing at her ear\r\nwith her back to the fire too.\r\n\r\nHe felt heavy, full: then a gentle loosening of his bowels. He stood up,\r\nundoing the waistband of his trousers. The cat mewed to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Miaow! he said in answer. Wait till I\xe2\x80\x99m ready.\r\n\r\nHeaviness: hot day coming. Too much trouble to fag up the stairs to the\r\nlanding.\r\n\r\nA paper. He liked to read at stool. Hope no ape comes knocking just as\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m.\r\n\r\nIn the tabledrawer he found an old number of Titbits. He folded it under\r\nhis armpit, went to the door and opened it. The cat went up in soft\r\nbounds. Ah, wanted to go upstairs, curl up in a ball on the bed.\r\n\r\nListening, he heard her voice:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Come, come, pussy. Come.\r\n\r\nHe went out through the backdoor into the garden: stood to listen\r\ntowards the next garden. No sound. Perhaps hanging clothes out to dry.\r\nThe maid was in the garden. Fine morning.\r\n\r\nHe bent down to regard a lean file of spearmint growing by the wall.\r\nMake a summerhouse here. Scarlet runners. Virginia creepers. Want to\r\nmanure the whole place over, scabby soil. A coat of liver of sulphur.\r\nAll soil like that without dung. Household slops. Loam, what is this\r\nthat is? The hens in the next garden: their droppings are very good top\r\ndressing. Best of all though are the cattle, especially when they are\r\nfed on those oilcakes. Mulch of dung. Best thing to clean ladies\xe2\x80\x99 kid\r\ngloves. Dirty cleans. Ashes too. Reclaim the whole place. Grow peas in\r\nthat corner there. Lettuce. Always have fresh greens then. Still gardens\r\nhave their drawbacks. That bee or bluebottle here Whitmonday.\r\n\r\nHe walked on. Where is my hat, by the way? Must have put it back on the\r\npeg. Or hanging up on the floor. Funny I don\xe2\x80\x99t remember that. Hallstand\r\ntoo full. Four umbrellas, her raincloak. Picking up the letters.\r\nDrago\xe2\x80\x99s shopbell ringing. Queer I was just thinking that moment. Brown\r\nbrillantined hair over his collar. Just had a wash and brushup. Wonder\r\nhave I time for a bath this morning. Tara street. Chap in the paybox\r\nthere got away James Stephens, they say. O\xe2\x80\x99Brien.\r\n\r\nDeep voice that fellow Dlugacz has. Agendath what is it? Now, my miss.\r\nEnthusiast.\r\n\r\nHe kicked open the crazy door of the jakes. Better be careful not to get\r\nthese trousers dirty for the funeral. He went in, bowing his head\r\nunder the low lintel. Leaving the door ajar, amid the stench of mouldy\r\nlimewash and stale cobwebs he undid his braces. Before sitting down he\r\npeered through a chink up at the nextdoor windows. The king was in his\r\ncountinghouse. Nobody.\r\n\r\nAsquat on the cuckstool he folded out his paper, turning its pages over\r\non his bared knees. Something new and easy. No great hurry. Keep it\r\na bit. Our prize titbit: Matcham\xe2\x80\x99s Masterstroke. Written by Mr Philip\r\nBeaufoy, Playgoers\xe2\x80\x99 Club, London. Payment at the rate of one guinea\r\na column has been made to the writer. Three and a half. Three pounds\r\nthree. Three pounds, thirteen and six.\r\n\r\nQuietly he read, restraining himself, the first column and, yielding but\r\nresisting, began the second. Midway, his last resistance yielding, he\r\nallowed his bowels to ease themselves quietly as he read, reading still\r\npatiently that slight constipation of yesterday quite gone. Hope it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nnot too big bring on piles again. No, just right. So. Ah! Costive. One\r\ntabloid of cascara sagrada. Life might be so. It did not move or touch\r\nhim but it was something quick and neat. Print anything now. Silly\r\nseason. He read on, seated calm above his own rising smell. Neat\r\ncertainly. Matcham often thinks of the masterstroke by which he won the\r\nlaughing witch who now. Begins and ends morally. Hand in hand. Smart. He\r\nglanced back through what he had read and, while feeling his water flow\r\nquietly, he envied kindly Mr Beaufoy who had written it and received\r\npayment of three pounds, thirteen and six.\r\n\r\nMight manage a sketch. By Mr and Mrs L. M. Bloom. Invent a story for\r\nsome proverb. Which? Time I used to try jotting down on my cuff what she\r\nsaid dressing. Dislike dressing together. Nicked myself shaving. Biting\r\nher nether lip, hooking the placket of her skirt. Timing her. 9.15.\r\nDid Roberts pay you yet? 9.20. What had Gretta Conroy on? 9.23. What\r\npossessed me to buy this comb? 9.24. I\xe2\x80\x99m swelled after that cabbage. A\r\nspeck of dust on the patent leather of her boot.\r\n\r\nRubbing smartly in turn each welt against her stockinged calf. Morning\r\nafter the bazaar dance when May\xe2\x80\x99s band played Ponchielli\xe2\x80\x99s dance of the\r\nhours. Explain that: morning hours, noon, then evening coming on, then\r\nnight hours. Washing her teeth. That was the first night. Her head\r\ndancing. Her fansticks clicking. Is that Boylan well off? He has money.\r\nWhy? I noticed he had a good rich smell off his breath dancing. No use\r\nhumming then. Allude to it. Strange kind of music that last night. The\r\nmirror was in shadow. She rubbed her handglass briskly on her woollen\r\nvest against her full wagging bub. Peering into it. Lines in her eyes.\r\nIt wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t pan out somehow.\r\n\r\nEvening hours, girls in grey gauze. Night hours then: black with daggers\r\nand eyemasks. Poetical idea: pink, then golden, then grey, then black.\r\nStill, true to life also. Day: then the night.\r\n\r\nHe tore away half the prize story sharply and wiped himself with it.\r\nThen he girded up his trousers, braced and buttoned himself. He pulled\r\nback the jerky shaky door of the jakes and came forth from the gloom\r\ninto the air.\r\n\r\nIn the bright light, lightened and cooled in limb, he eyed carefully his\r\nblack trousers: the ends, the knees, the houghs of the knees. What time\r\nis the funeral? Better find out in the paper.\r\n\r\nA creak and a dark whirr in the air high up. The bells of George\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nchurch. They tolled the hour: loud dark iron.\r\n\r\n     Heigho! Heigho!\r\n     Heigho! Heigho!\r\n     Heigho! Heigho!\r\n\r\nQuarter to. There again: the overtone following through the air. A\r\nthird.\r\n\r\nPoor Dignam!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[ 5 ]\r\n\r\nBy lorries along sir John Rogerson\xe2\x80\x99s quay Mr Bloom walked soberly, past\r\nWindmill lane, Leask\xe2\x80\x99s the linseed crusher, the postal telegraph office.\r\nCould have given that address too. And past the sailors\xe2\x80\x99 home. He turned\r\nfrom the morning noises of the quayside and walked through Lime street.\r\nBy Brady\xe2\x80\x99s cottages a boy for the skins lolled, his bucket of offal\r\nlinked, smoking a chewed fagbutt. A smaller girl with scars of eczema\r\non her forehead eyed him, listlessly holding her battered caskhoop. Tell\r\nhim if he smokes he won\xe2\x80\x99t grow. O let him! His life isn\xe2\x80\x99t such a bed of\r\nroses. Waiting outside pubs to bring da home. Come home to ma, da.\r\nSlack hour: won\xe2\x80\x99t be many there. He crossed Townsend street, passed\r\nthe frowning face of Bethel. El, yes: house of: Aleph, Beth. And past\r\nNichols\xe2\x80\x99 the undertaker. At eleven it is. Time enough. Daresay Corny\r\nKelleher bagged the job for O\xe2\x80\x99Neill\xe2\x80\x99s. Singing with his eyes shut.\r\nCorny. Met her once in the park. In the dark. What a lark. Police tout.\r\nHer name and address she then told with my tooraloom tooraloom tay.\r\nO, surely he bagged it. Bury him cheap in a whatyoumaycall. With my\r\ntooraloom, tooraloom, tooraloom, tooraloom.\r\n\r\nIn Westland row he halted before the window of the Belfast and Oriental\r\nTea Company and read the legends of leadpapered packets: choice blend,\r\nfinest quality, family tea. Rather warm. Tea. Must get some from Tom\r\nKernan. Couldn\xe2\x80\x99t ask him at a funeral, though. While his eyes still read\r\nblandly he took off his hat quietly inhaling his hairoil and sent his\r\nright hand with slow grace over his brow and hair. Very warm morning.\r\nUnder their dropped lids his eyes found the tiny bow of the leather\r\nheadband inside his high grade ha. Just there. His right hand came down\r\ninto the bowl of his hat. His fingers found quickly a card behind the\r\nheadband and transferred it to his waistcoat pocket.\r\n\r\nSo warm. His right hand once more more slowly went over his brow and\r\nhair. Then he put on his hat again, relieved: and read again: choice\r\nblend, made of the finest Ceylon brands. The far east. Lovely spot it\r\nmust be: the garden of the world, big lazy leaves to float about on,\r\ncactuses, flowery meads, snaky lianas they call them. Wonder is it like\r\nthat. Those Cinghalese lobbing about in the sun in dolce far niente, not\r\ndoing a hand\xe2\x80\x99s turn all day. Sleep six months out of twelve. Too hot to\r\nquarrel. Influence of the climate. Lethargy. Flowers of idleness. The\r\nair feeds most. Azotes. Hothouse in Botanic gardens. Sensitive plants.\r\nWaterlilies. Petals too tired to. Sleeping sickness in the air. Walk on\r\nroseleaves. Imagine trying to eat tripe and cowheel. Where was the chap\r\nI saw in that picture somewhere? Ah yes, in the dead sea floating on his\r\nback, reading a book with a parasol open. Couldn\xe2\x80\x99t sink if you tried: so\r\nthick with salt. Because the weight of the water, no, the weight of\r\nthe body in the water is equal to the weight of the what? Or is it the\r\nvolume is equal to the weight? It\xe2\x80\x99s a law something like that. Vance in\r\nHigh school cracking his fingerjoints, teaching. The college curriculum.\r\nCracking curriculum. What is weight really when you say the weight?\r\nThirtytwo feet per second per second. Law of falling bodies: per second\r\nper second. They all fall to the ground. The earth. It\xe2\x80\x99s the force of\r\ngravity of the earth is the weight.\r\n\r\nHe turned away and sauntered across the road. How did she walk with her\r\nsausages? Like that something. As he walked he took the folded Freeman\r\nfrom his sidepocket, unfolded it, rolled it lengthwise in a baton and\r\ntapped it at each sauntering step against his trouserleg. Careless air:\r\njust drop in to see. Per second per second. Per second for every second\r\nit means. From the curbstone he darted a keen glance through the door of\r\nthe postoffice. Too late box. Post here. No-one. In.\r\n\r\nHe handed the card through the brass grill.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Are there any letters for me? he asked.\r\n\r\nWhile the postmistress searched a pigeonhole he gazed at the recruiting\r\nposter with soldiers of all arms on parade: and held the tip of his\r\nbaton against his nostrils, smelling freshprinted rag paper. No answer\r\nprobably. Went too far last time.\r\n\r\nThe postmistress handed him back through the grill his card with a\r\nletter. He thanked her and glanced rapidly at the typed envelope.\r\n\r\n      Henry Flower Esq,\r\n         c/o P. O. Westland Row,\r\n            City.\r\n\r\nAnswered anyhow. He slipped card and letter into his sidepocket,\r\nreviewing again the soldiers on parade. Where\xe2\x80\x99s old Tweedy\xe2\x80\x99s regiment?\r\nCastoff soldier. There: bearskin cap and hackle plume. No, he\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\ngrenadier. Pointed cuffs. There he is: royal Dublin fusiliers. Redcoats.\r\nToo showy. That must be why the women go after them. Uniform. Easier to\r\nenlist and drill. Maud Gonne\xe2\x80\x99s letter about taking them off O\xe2\x80\x99Connell\r\nstreet at night: disgrace to our Irish capital. Griffith\xe2\x80\x99s paper is on\r\nthe same tack now: an army rotten with venereal disease: overseas or\r\nhalfseasover empire. Half baked they look: hypnotised like. Eyes front.\r\nMark time. Table: able. Bed: ed. The King\xe2\x80\x99s own. Never see him dressed\r\nup as a fireman or a bobby. A mason, yes.\r\n\r\nHe strolled out of the postoffice and turned to the right. Talk: as if\r\nthat would mend matters. His hand went into his pocket and a forefinger\r\nfelt its way under the flap of the envelope, ripping it open in jerks.\r\nWomen will pay a lot of heed, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think. His fingers drew forth the\r\nletter the letter and crumpled the envelope in his pocket. Something\r\npinned on: photo perhaps. Hair? No.\r\n\r\nM\xe2\x80\x99Coy. Get rid of him quickly. Take me out of my way. Hate company when\r\nyou.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Hello, Bloom. Where are you off to?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Hello, M\xe2\x80\x99Coy. Nowhere in particular.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94How\xe2\x80\x99s the body?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Fine. How are you?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Just keeping alive, M\xe2\x80\x99Coy said.\r\n\r\nHis eyes on the black tie and clothes he asked with low respect:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Is there any... no trouble I hope? I see you\xe2\x80\x99re...\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94O, no, Mr Bloom said. Poor Dignam, you know. The funeral is today.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94To be sure, poor fellow. So it is. What time?\r\n\r\nA photo it isn\xe2\x80\x99t. A badge maybe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94E...eleven, Mr Bloom answered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I must try to get out there, M\xe2\x80\x99Coy said. Eleven, is it? I only heard it\r\nlast night. Who was telling me? Holohan. You know Hoppy?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I know.\r\n\r\nMr Bloom gazed across the road at the outsider drawn up before the door\r\nof the Grosvenor. The porter hoisted the valise up on the well. She\r\nstood still, waiting, while the man, husband, brother, like her,\r\nsearched his pockets for change. Stylish kind of coat with that roll\r\ncollar, warm for a day like this, looks like blanketcloth. Careless\r\nstand of her with her hands in those patch pockets. Like that haughty\r\ncreature at the polo match. Women all for caste till you touch the spot.\r\nHandsome is and handsome does. Reserved about to yield. The honourable\r\nMrs and Brutus is an honourable man. Possess her once take the starch\r\nout of her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I was with Bob Doran, he\xe2\x80\x99s on one of his periodical bends, and what do\r\nyou call him Bantam Lyons. Just down there in Conway\xe2\x80\x99s we were.\r\n\r\nDoran Lyons in Conway\xe2\x80\x99s. She raised a gloved hand to her hair. In came\r\nHoppy. Having a wet. Drawing back his head and gazing far from beneath\r\nhis vailed eyelids he saw the bright fawn skin shine in the glare, the\r\nbraided drums. Clearly I can see today. Moisture about gives long sight\r\nperhaps. Talking of one thing or another. Lady\xe2\x80\x99s hand. Which side will\r\nshe get up?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94And he said: Sad thing about our poor friend Paddy! What Paddy? I said.\r\nPoor little Paddy Dignam, he said.\r\n\r\nOff to the country: Broadstone probably. High brown boots with laces\r\ndangling. Wellturned foot. What is he foostering over that change for?\r\nSees me looking. Eye out for other fellow always. Good fallback. Two\r\nstrings to her bow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Why? I said. What\xe2\x80\x99s wrong with him? I said.\r\n\r\nProud: rich: silk stockings.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Yes, Mr Bloom said.\r\n\r\nHe moved a little to the side of M\xe2\x80\x99Coy\xe2\x80\x99s talking head. Getting up in a\r\nminute.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94What\xe2\x80\x99s wrong with him? He said. He\xe2\x80\x99s dead, he said. And, faith, he\r\nfilled up. Is it Paddy Dignam? I said. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t believe it when I\r\nheard it. I was with him no later than Friday last or Thursday was it in\r\nthe Arch. Yes, he said. He\xe2\x80\x99s gone. He died on Monday, poor fellow.\r\n\r\nWatch! Watch! Silk flash rich stockings white. Watch!\r\n\r\nA heavy tramcar honking its gong slewed between.\r\n\r\nLost it. Curse your noisy pugnose. Feels locked out of it. Paradise and\r\nthe peri. Always happening like that. The very moment. Girl in Eustace\r\nstreet hallway Monday was it settling her garter. Her friend covering\r\nthe display of. Esprit de corps. Well, what are you gaping at?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Yes, yes, Mr Bloom said after a dull sigh. Another gone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94One of the best, M\xe2\x80\x99Coy said.\r\n\r\nThe tram passed. They drove off towards the Loop Line bridge, her rich\r\ngloved hand on the steel grip. Flicker, flicker: the laceflare of her\r\nhat in the sun: flicker, flick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Wife well, I suppose? M\xe2\x80\x99Coy\xe2\x80\x99s changed voice said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94O, yes, Mr Bloom said. Tiptop, thanks.\r\n\r\nHe unrolled the newspaper baton idly and read idly:\r\n\r\n     What is home without\r\n     Plumtree\xe2\x80\x99s Potted Meat?\r\n     Incomplete.\r\n     With it an abode of bliss.\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94My missus has just got an engagement. At least it\xe2\x80\x99s not settled yet.\r\n\r\nValise tack again. By the way no harm. I\xe2\x80\x99m off that, thanks.\r\n\r\nMr Bloom turned his largelidded eyes with unhasty friendliness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94My wife too, he said. She\xe2\x80\x99s going to sing at a swagger affair in the\r\nUlster Hall, Belfast, on the twentyfifth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94That so? M\xe2\x80\x99Coy said. Glad to hear that, old man. Who\xe2\x80\x99s getting it up?\r\n\r\nMrs Marion Bloom. Not up yet. Queen was in her bedroom eating bread and.\r\nNo book. Blackened court cards laid along her thigh by sevens. Dark lady\r\nand fair man. Letter. Cat furry black ball. Torn strip of envelope.\r\n\r\n     Love\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n     Old\r\n     Sweet\r\n     Song\r\n     Comes lo-ove\xe2\x80\x99s old...\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94It\xe2\x80\x99s a kind of a tour, don\xe2\x80\x99t you see, Mr Bloom said thoughtfully.\r\nSweeeet song. There\xe2\x80\x99s a committee formed. Part shares and part profits.\r\n\r\nM\xe2\x80\x99Coy nodded, picking at his moustache stubble.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94O, well, he said. That\xe2\x80\x99s good news.\r\n\r\nHe moved to go.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Well, glad to see you looking fit, he said. Meet you knocking around.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Yes, Mr Bloom said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Tell you what, M\xe2\x80\x99Coy said. You might put down my name at the funeral,\r\nwill you? I\xe2\x80\x99d like to go but I mightn\xe2\x80\x99t be able, you see. There\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\ndrowning case at Sandycove may turn up and then the coroner and myself\r\nwould have to go down if the body is found. You just shove in my name if\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m not there, will you?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ll do that, Mr Bloom said, moving to get off. That\xe2\x80\x99ll be all right.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Right, M\xe2\x80\x99Coy said brightly. Thanks, old man. I\xe2\x80\x99d go if I possibly\r\ncould. Well, tolloll. Just C. P. M\xe2\x80\x99Coy will do.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94That will be done, Mr Bloom answered firmly.\r\n\r\nDidn\xe2\x80\x99t catch me napping that wheeze. The quick touch. Soft mark. I\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nlike my job. Valise I have a particular fancy for. Leather. Capped\r\ncorners, rivetted edges, double action lever lock. Bob Cowley lent him\r\nhis for the Wicklow regatta concert last year and never heard tidings of\r\nit from that good day to this.\r\n\r\nMr Bloom, strolling towards Brunswick street, smiled. My missus has just\r\ngot an. Reedy freckled soprano. Cheeseparing nose. Nice enough in its\r\nway: for a little ballad. No guts in it. You and me, don\xe2\x80\x99t you know:\r\nin the same boat. Softsoaping. Give you the needle that would. Can\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nhe hear the difference? Think he\xe2\x80\x99s that way inclined a bit. Against\r\nmy grain somehow. Thought that Belfast would fetch him. I hope that\r\nsmallpox up there doesn\xe2\x80\x99t get worse. Suppose she wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t let herself be\r\nvaccinated again. Your wife and my wife.\r\n\r\nWonder is he pimping after me?\r\n\r\nMr Bloom stood at the corner, his eyes wandering over the multicoloured\r\nhoardings. Cantrell and Cochrane\xe2\x80\x99s Ginger Ale (Aromatic). Clery\xe2\x80\x99s Summer\r\nSale. No, he\xe2\x80\x99s going on straight. Hello. Leah tonight. Mrs Bandmann\r\nPalmer. Like to see her again in that. Hamlet she played last night.\r\nMale impersonator. Perhaps he was a woman. Why Ophelia committed\r\nsuicide. Poor papa! How he used to talk of Kate Bateman in that. Outside\r\nthe Adelphi in London waited all the afternoon to get in. Year before\r\nI was born that was: sixtyfive. And Ristori in Vienna. What is this the\r\nright name is? By Mosenthal it is. Rachel, is it? No. The scene he was\r\nalways talking about where the old blind Abraham recognises the voice\r\nand puts his fingers on his face.\r\n\r\nNathan\xe2\x80\x99s voice! His son\xe2\x80\x99s voice! I hear the voice of Nathan who left his\r\nfather to die of grief and misery in my arms, who left the house of his\r\nfather and left the God of his father.\r\n\r\nEvery word is so deep, Leopold.\r\n\r\nPoor papa! Poor man! I\xe2\x80\x99m glad I didn\xe2\x80\x99t go into the room to look at his\r\nface. That day! O, dear! O, dear! Ffoo! Well, perhaps it was best for\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nMr Bloom went round the corner and passed the drooping nags of the\r\nhazard. No use thinking of it any more. Nosebag time. Wish I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t met\r\nthat M\xe2\x80\x99Coy fellow.\r\n\r\nHe came nearer and heard a crunching of gilded oats, the gently champing\r\nteeth. Their full buck eyes regarded him as he went by, amid the sweet\r\noaten reek of horsepiss. Their Eldorado. Poor jugginses! Damn all they\r\nknow or care about anything with their long noses stuck in nosebags.\r\nToo full for words. Still they get their feed all right and their doss.\r\nGelded too: a stump of black guttapercha wagging limp between their\r\nhaunches. Might be happy all the same that way. Good poor brutes they\r\nlook. Still their neigh can be very irritating.\r\n\r\nHe drew the letter from his pocket and folded it into the newspaper he\r\ncarried. Might just walk into her here. The lane is safer.\r\n\r\nHe passed the cabman\xe2\x80\x99s shelter. Curious the life of drifting cabbies.\r\nAll weathers, all places, time or setdown, no will of their own. Voglio\r\ne non. Like to give them an odd cigarette. Sociable. Shout a few flying\r\nsyllables as they pass. He hummed:\r\n\r\n     L\xc3\xa0 ci darem la mano\r\n     La la lala la la.\r\n\r\nHe turned into Cumberland street and, going on some paces, halted in the\r\nlee of the station wall. No-one. Meade\xe2\x80\x99s timberyard. Piled balks. Ruins\r\nand tenements. With careful tread he passed over a hopscotch court with\r\nits forgotten pickeystone. Not a sinner. Near the timberyard a squatted\r\nchild at marbles, alone, shooting the taw with a cunnythumb. A wise\r\ntabby, a blinking sphinx, watched from her warm sill. Pity to disturb\r\nthem. Mohammed cut a piece out of his mantle not to wake her. Open it.\r\nAnd once I played marbles when I went to that old dame\xe2\x80\x99s school. She\r\nliked mignonette. Mrs Ellis\xe2\x80\x99s. And Mr? He opened the letter within the\r\nnewspaper.\r\n\r\nA flower. I think it\xe2\x80\x99s a. A yellow flower with flattened petals. Not\r\nannoyed then? What does she say?\r\n\r\nDear Henry\r\n\r\nI got your last letter to me and thank you very much for it. I am sorry\r\nyou did not like my last letter. Why did you enclose the stamps? I am\r\nawfully angry with you. I do wish I could punish you for that. I called\r\nyou naughty boy because I do not like that other world. Please tell me\r\nwhat is the real meaning of that word? Are you not happy in your home\r\nyou poor little naughty boy? I do wish I could do something for you.\r\nPlease tell me what you think of poor me. I often think of the beautiful\r\nname you have. Dear Henry, when will we meet? I think of you so often\r\nyou have no idea. I have never felt myself so much drawn to a man as\r\nyou. I feel so bad about. Please write me a long letter and tell me\r\nmore. Remember if you do not I will punish you. So now you know what I\r\nwill do to you, you naughty boy, if you do not wrote. O how I long to\r\nmeet you. Henry dear, do not deny my request before my patience are\r\nexhausted. Then I will tell you all. Goodbye now, naughty darling, I\r\nhave such a bad headache. today. and write by return to your longing\r\n\r\nMartha\r\n\r\nP. S. Do tell me what kind of perfume does your wife use. I want to\r\nknow.\r\n\r\nHe tore the flower gravely from its pinhold smelt its almost no smell\r\nand placed it in his heart pocket. Language of flowers. They like it\r\nbecause no-one can hear. Or a poison bouquet to strike him down. Then\r\nwalking slowly forward he read the letter again, murmuring here and\r\nthere a word. Angry tulips with you darling manflower punish your cactus\r\nif you don\xe2\x80\x99t please poor forgetmenot how I long violets to dear roses\r\nwhen we soon anemone meet all naughty nightstalk wife Martha\xe2\x80\x99s perfume.\r\nHaving read it all he took it from the newspaper and put it back in his\r\nsidepocket.\r\n\r\nWeak joy opened his lips. Changed since the first letter. Wonder did she\r\nwrote it herself. Doing the indignant: a girl of good family like me,\r\nrespectable character. Could meet one Sunday after the rosary. Thank\r\nyou: not having any. Usual love scrimmage. Then running round corners.\r\nBad as a row with Molly. Cigar has a cooling effect. Narcotic. Go\r\nfurther next time. Naughty boy: punish: afraid of words, of course.\r\nBrutal, why not? Try it anyhow. A bit at a time.\r\n\r\nFingering still the letter in his pocket he drew the pin out of it.\r\nCommon pin, eh? He threw it on the road. Out of her clothes somewhere:\r\npinned together. Queer the number of pins they always have. No roses\r\nwithout thorns.\r\n\r\nFlat Dublin voices bawled in his head. Those two sluts that night in the\r\nCoombe, linked together in the rain.\r\n\r\n     O, Mairy lost the pin of her drawers.\r\n     She didn\xe2\x80\x99t know what to do\r\n     To keep it up,\r\n     To keep it up.\r\n\r\nIt? Them. Such a bad headache. Has her roses probably. Or sitting all\r\nday typing. Eyefocus bad for stomach nerves. What perfume does your wife\r\nuse. Now could you make out a thing like that?\r\n\r\n     To keep it up.\r\n\r\nMartha, Mary. I saw that picture somewhere I forget now old master or\r\nfaked for money. He is sitting in their house, talking. Mysterious. Also\r\nthe two sluts in the Coombe would listen.\r\n\r\n     To keep it up.\r\n\r\nNice kind of evening feeling. No more wandering about. Just loll there:\r\nquiet dusk: let everything rip. Forget. Tell about places you have been,\r\nstrange customs. The other one, jar on her head, was getting the supper:\r\nfruit, olives, lovely cool water out of a well, stonecold like the hole\r\nin the wall at Ashtown. Must carry a paper goblet next time I go to the\r\ntrottingmatches. She listens with big dark soft eyes. Tell her: more and\r\nmore: all. Then a sigh: silence. Long long long rest.\r\n\r\nGoing under the railway arch he took out the envelope, tore it swiftly\r\nin shreds and scattered them towards the road. The shreds fluttered\r\naway, sank in the dank air: a white flutter, then all sank.\r\n\r\nHenry Flower. You could tear up a cheque for a hundred pounds in the\r\nsame way. Simple bit of paper. Lord Iveagh once cashed a sevenfigure\r\ncheque for a million in the bank of Ireland. Shows you the money to be\r\nmade out of porter. Still the other brother lord Ardilaun has to change\r\nhis shirt four times a day, they say. Skin breeds lice or vermin. A\r\nmillion pounds, wait a moment. Twopence a pint, fourpence a quart,\r\neightpence a gallon of porter, no, one and fourpence a gallon of porter.\r\nOne and four into twenty: fifteen about. Yes, exactly. Fifteen millions\r\nof barrels of porter.\r\n\r\nWhat am I saying barrels? Gallons. About a million barrels all the same.\r\n\r\nAn incoming train clanked heavily above his head, coach after coach.\r\nBarrels bumped in his head: dull porter slopped and churned inside.\r\nThe bungholes sprang open and a huge dull flood leaked out, flowing\r\ntogether, winding through mudflats all over the level land, a lazy\r\npooling swirl of liquor bearing along wideleaved flowers of its froth.\r\n\r\nHe had reached the open backdoor of All Hallows. Stepping into the porch\r\nhe doffed his hat, took the card from his pocket and tucked it again\r\nbehind the leather headband. Damn it. I might have tried to work M\xe2\x80\x99Coy\r\nfor a pass to Mullingar.\r\n\r\nSame notice on the door. Sermon by the very reverend John Conmee S. J.\r\non saint Peter Claver S. J. and the African Mission. Prayers for the\r\nconversion of Gladstone they had too when he was almost unconscious. The\r\nprotestants are the same. Convert Dr William J. Walsh D.D. to the true\r\nreligion. Save China\xe2\x80\x99s millions. Wonder how they explain it to the\r\nheathen Chinee. Prefer an ounce of opium. Celestials. Rank heresy for\r\nthem. Buddha their god lying on his side in the museum. Taking it easy\r\nwith hand under his cheek. Josssticks burning. Not like Ecce Homo. Crown\r\nof thorns and cross. Clever idea Saint Patrick the shamrock. Chopsticks?\r\nConmee: Martin Cunningham knows him: distinguishedlooking. Sorry I\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t work him about getting Molly into the choir instead of that\r\nFather Farley who looked a fool but wasn\xe2\x80\x99t. They\xe2\x80\x99re taught that. He\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nnot going out in bluey specs with the sweat rolling off him to baptise\r\nblacks, is he? The glasses would take their fancy, flashing. Like to see\r\nthem sitting round in a ring with blub lips, entranced, listening. Still\r\nlife. Lap it up like milk, I suppose.\r\n\r\nThe cold smell of sacred stone called him. He trod the worn steps,\r\npushed the swingdoor and entered softly by the rere.\r\n\r\nSomething going on: some sodality. Pity so empty. Nice discreet place\r\nto be next some girl. Who is my neighbour? Jammed by the hour to slow\r\nmusic. That woman at midnight mass. Seventh heaven. Women knelt in the\r\nbenches with crimson halters round their necks, heads bowed. A batch\r\nknelt at the altarrails. The priest went along by them, murmuring,\r\nholding the thing in his hands. He stopped at each, took out a\r\ncommunion, shook a drop or two (are they in water?) off it and put it\r\nneatly into her mouth. Her hat and head sank. Then the next one. Her hat\r\nsank at once. Then the next one: a small old woman. The priest bent down\r\nto put it into her mouth, murmuring all the time. Latin. The next one.\r\nShut your eyes and open your mouth. What? Corpus: body. Corpse. Good\r\nidea the Latin. Stupefies them first. Hospice for the dying. They\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t seem to chew it: only swallow it down. Rum idea: eating bits of a\r\ncorpse. Why the cannibals cotton to it.\r\n\r\nHe stood aside watching their blind masks pass down the aisle, one by\r\none, and seek their places. He approached a bench and seated himself in\r\nits corner, nursing his hat and newspaper. These pots we have to wear.\r\nWe ought to have hats modelled on our heads. They were about him here\r\nand there, with heads still bowed in their crimson halters, waiting for\r\nit to melt in their stomachs. Something like those mazzoth: it\xe2\x80\x99s that\r\nsort of bread: unleavened shewbread. Look at them. Now I bet it makes\r\nthem feel happy. Lollipop. It does. Yes, bread of angels it\xe2\x80\x99s called.\r\nThere\xe2\x80\x99s a big idea behind it, kind of kingdom of God is within you feel.\r\nFirst communicants. Hokypoky penny a lump. Then feel all like one family\r\nparty, same in the theatre, all in the same swim. They do. I\xe2\x80\x99m sure of\r\nthat. Not so lonely. In our confraternity. Then come out a bit spreeish.\r\nLet off steam. Thing is if you really believe in it. Lourdes cure,\r\nwaters of oblivion, and the Knock apparition, statues bleeding. Old\r\nfellow asleep near that confessionbox. Hence those snores. Blind faith.\r\nSafe in the arms of kingdom come. Lulls all pain. Wake this time next\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nHe saw the priest stow the communion cup away, well in, and kneel an\r\ninstant before it, showing a large grey bootsole from under the lace\r\naffair he had on. Suppose he lost the pin of his. He wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t know what\r\nto do to. Bald spot behind. Letters on his back: I.N.R.I? No: I.H.S.\r\nMolly told me one time I asked her. I have sinned: or no: I have\r\nsuffered, it is. And the other one? Iron nails ran in.\r\n\r\nMeet one Sunday after the rosary. Do not deny my request. Turn up with\r\na veil and black bag. Dusk and the light behind her. She might be here\r\nwith a ribbon round her neck and do the other thing all the same on the\r\nsly. Their character. That fellow that turned queen\xe2\x80\x99s evidence on the\r\ninvincibles he used to receive the, Carey was his name, the communion\r\nevery morning. This very church. Peter Carey, yes. No, Peter Claver I am\r\nthinking of. Denis Carey. And just imagine that. Wife and six children\r\nat home. And plotting that murder all the time. Those crawthumpers,\r\nnow that\xe2\x80\x99s a good name for them, there\xe2\x80\x99s always something shiftylooking\r\nabout them. They\xe2\x80\x99re not straight men of business either. O, no, she\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nnot here: the flower: no, no. By the way, did I tear up that envelope?\r\nYes: under the bridge.\r\n\r\nThe priest was rinsing out the chalice: then he tossed off the dregs\r\nsmartly. Wine. Makes it more aristocratic than for example if he drank\r\nwhat they are used to Guinness\xe2\x80\x99s porter or some temperance beverage\r\nWheatley\xe2\x80\x99s Dublin hop bitters or Cantrell and Cochrane\xe2\x80\x99s ginger ale\r\n(aromatic). Doesn\xe2\x80\x99t give them any of it: shew wine: only the other.\r\nCold comfort. Pious fraud but quite right: otherwise they\xe2\x80\x99d have one old\r\nbooser worse than another coming along, cadging for a drink. Queer the\r\nwhole atmosphere of the. Quite right. Perfectly right that is.\r\n\r\nMr Bloom looked back towards the choir. Not going to be any music. Pity.\r\nWho has the organ here I wonder? Old Glynn he knew how to make that\r\ninstrument talk, the vibrato: fifty pounds a year they say he had in\r\nGardiner street. Molly was in fine voice that day, the Stabat Mater\r\nof Rossini. Father Bernard Vaughan\xe2\x80\x99s sermon first. Christ or Pilate?\r\nChrist, but don\xe2\x80\x99t keep us all night over it. Music they wanted.\r\nFootdrill stopped. Could hear a pin drop. I told her to pitch her voice\r\nagainst that corner. I could feel the thrill in the air, the full, the\r\npeople looking up:\r\n\r\nQuis est homo.\r\n\r\nSome of that old sacred music splendid. Mercadante: seven last words.\r\nMozart\xe2\x80\x99s twelfth mass: Gloria in that. Those old popes keen on music, on\r\nart and statues and pictures of all kinds. Palestrina for example too.\r\nThey had a gay old time while it lasted. Healthy too, chanting, regular\r\nhours, then brew liqueurs. Benedictine. Green Chartreuse. Still, having\r\neunuchs in their choir that was coming it a bit thick. What kind of\r\nvoice is it? Must be curious to hear after their own strong basses.\r\nConnoisseurs. Suppose they wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t feel anything after. Kind of a\r\nplacid. No worry. Fall into flesh, don\xe2\x80\x99t they? Gluttons, tall, long\r\nlegs. Who knows? Eunuch. One way out of it.\r\n\r\nHe saw the priest bend down and kiss the altar and then face about and\r\nbless all the people. All crossed themselves and stood up. Mr Bloom\r\nglanced about him and then stood up, looking over the risen hats. Stand\r\nup at the gospel of course. Then all settled down on their knees again\r\nand he sat back quietly in his bench. The priest came down from the\r\naltar, holding the thing out from him, and he and the massboy answered\r\neach other in Latin. Then the priest knelt down and began to read off a\r\ncard:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94O God, our refuge and our strength...\r\n\r\nMr Bloom put his face forward to catch the words. English. Throw them\r\nthe bone. I remember slightly. How long since your last mass? Glorious\r\nand immaculate virgin. Joseph, her spouse. Peter and Paul. More\r\ninteresting if you understood what it was all about. Wonderful\r\norganisation certainly, goes like clockwork. Confession. Everyone wants\r\nto. Then I will tell you all. Penance. Punish me, please. Great weapon\r\nin their hands. More than doctor or solicitor. Woman dying to. And I\r\nschschschschschsch. And did you chachachachacha? And why did you? Look\r\ndown at her ring to find an excuse. Whispering gallery walls have ears.\r\nHusband learn to his surprise. God\xe2\x80\x99s little joke. Then out she comes.\r\nRepentance skindeep. Lovely shame. Pray at an altar. Hail Mary and Holy\r\nMary. Flowers, incense, candles melting. Hide her blushes. Salvation\r\narmy blatant imitation. Reformed prostitute will address the meeting.\r\nHow I found the Lord. Squareheaded chaps those must be in Rome: they\r\nwork the whole show. And don\xe2\x80\x99t they rake in the money too? Bequests\r\nalso: to the P.P. for the time being in his absolute discretion.\r\nMasses for the repose of my soul to be said publicly with open doors.\r\nMonasteries and convents. The priest in that Fermanagh will case in the\r\nwitnessbox. No browbeating him. He had his answer pat for everything.\r\nLiberty and exaltation of our holy mother the church. The doctors of the\r\nchurch: they mapped out the whole theology of it.\r\n\r\nThe priest prayed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Blessed Michael, archangel, defend us in the hour of conflict. Be\r\nour safeguard against the wickedness and snares of the devil (may God\r\nrestrain him, we humbly pray!): and do thou, O prince of the heavenly\r\nhost, by the power of God thrust Satan down to hell and with him those\r\nother wicked spirits who wander through the world for the ruin of souls.\r\n\r\nThe priest and the massboy stood up and walked off. All over. The women\r\nremained behind: thanksgiving.\r\n\r\nBetter be shoving along. Brother Buzz. Come around with the plate\r\nperhaps. Pay your Easter duty.\r\n\r\nHe stood up. Hello. Were those two buttons of my waistcoat open all the\r\ntime? Women enjoy it. Never tell you. But we. Excuse, miss, there\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\n(whh!) just a (whh!) fluff. Or their skirt behind, placket unhooked.\r\nGlimpses of the moon. Annoyed if you don\xe2\x80\x99t. Why didn\xe2\x80\x99t you tell me\r\nbefore. Still like you better untidy. Good job it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t farther south.\r\nHe passed, discreetly buttoning, down the aisle and out through the main\r\ndoor into the light. He stood a moment unseeing by the cold black marble\r\nbowl while before him and behind two worshippers dipped furtive hands in\r\nthe low tide of holy water. Trams: a car of Prescott\xe2\x80\x99s dyeworks: a widow\r\nin her weeds. Notice because I\xe2\x80\x99m in mourning myself. He covered himself.\r\nHow goes the time? Quarter past. Time enough yet. Better get that lotion\r\nmade up. Where is this? Ah yes, the last time. Sweny\xe2\x80\x99s in Lincoln place.\r\nChemists rarely move. Their green and gold beaconjars too heavy to stir.\r\nHamilton Long\xe2\x80\x99s, founded in the year of the flood. Huguenot churchyard\r\nnear there. Visit some day.\r\n\r\nHe walked southward along Westland row. But the recipe is in the other\r\ntrousers. O, and I forgot that latchkey too. Bore this funeral affair.\r\nO well, poor fellow, it\xe2\x80\x99s not his fault. When was it I got it made up\r\nlast? Wait. I changed a sovereign I remember. First of the month it must\r\nhave been or the second. O, he can look it up in the prescriptions book.\r\n\r\nThe chemist turned back page after page. Sandy shrivelled smell he seems\r\nto have. Shrunken skull. And old. Quest for the philosopher\xe2\x80\x99s stone. The\r\nalchemists. Drugs age you after mental excitement. Lethargy then. Why?\r\nReaction. A lifetime in a night. Gradually changes your character.\r\nLiving all the day among herbs, ointments, disinfectants. All his\r\nalabaster lilypots. Mortar and pestle. Aq. Dist. Fol. Laur. Te Virid.\r\nSmell almost cure you like the dentist\xe2\x80\x99s doorbell. Doctor Whack. He\r\nought to physic himself a bit. Electuary or emulsion. The first fellow\r\nthat picked an herb to cure himself had a bit of pluck. Simples. Want to\r\nbe careful. Enough stuff here to chloroform you. Test: turns blue\r\nlitmus paper red. Chloroform. Overdose of laudanum. Sleeping draughts.\r\nLovephiltres. Paragoric poppysyrup bad for cough. Clogs the pores or the\r\nphlegm. Poisons the only cures. Remedy where you least expect it. Clever\r\nof nature.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94About a fortnight ago, sir?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Yes, Mr Bloom said.\r\n\r\nHe waited by the counter, inhaling slowly the keen reek of drugs, the\r\ndusty dry smell of sponges and loofahs. Lot of time taken up telling\r\nyour aches and pains.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Sweet almond oil and tincture of benzoin, Mr Bloom said, and then\r\norangeflower water...\r\n\r\nIt certainly did make her skin so delicate white like wax.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94And white wax also, he said.\r\n\r\nBrings out the darkness of her eyes. Looking at me, the sheet up to\r\nher eyes, Spanish, smelling herself, when I was fixing the links in my\r\ncuffs. Those homely recipes are often the best: strawberries for the\r\nteeth: nettles and rainwater: oatmeal they say steeped in buttermilk.\r\nSkinfood. One of the old queen\xe2\x80\x99s sons, duke of Albany was it? had only\r\none skin. Leopold, yes. Three we have. Warts, bunions and pimples to\r\nmake it worse. But you want a perfume too. What perfume does your? Peau\r\nd\xe2\x80\x99Espagne. That orangeflower water is so fresh. Nice smell these soaps\r\nhave. Pure curd soap. Time to get a bath round the corner. Hammam.\r\nTurkish. Massage. Dirt gets rolled up in your navel. Nicer if a nice\r\ngirl did it. Also I think I. Yes I. Do it in the bath. Curious longing\r\nI. Water to water. Combine business with pleasure. Pity no time for\r\nmassage. Feel fresh then all the day. Funeral be rather glum.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Yes, sir, the chemist said. That was two and nine. Have you brought a\r\nbottle?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94No, Mr Bloom said. Make it up, please. I\xe2\x80\x99ll call later in the day and\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll take one of these soaps. How much are they?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Fourpence, sir.\r\n\r\nMr Bloom raised a cake to his nostrils. Sweet lemony wax.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ll take this one, he said. That makes three and a penny.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Yes, sir, the chemist said. You can pay all together, sir, when you\r\ncome back.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Good, Mr Bloom said.\r\n\r\nHe strolled out of the shop, the newspaper baton under his armpit, the\r\ncoolwrappered soap in his left hand.\r\n\r\nAt his armpit Bantam Lyons\xe2\x80\x99 voice and hand said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Hello, Bloom. What\xe2\x80\x99s the best news? Is that today\xe2\x80\x99s? Show us a minute.\r\n\r\nShaved off his moustache again, by Jove! Long cold upper lip. To look\r\nyounger. He does look balmy. Younger than I am.\r\n\r\nBantam Lyons\xe2\x80\x99s yellow blacknailed fingers unrolled the baton. Wants a\r\nwash too. Take off the rough dirt. Good morning, have you used Pears\xe2\x80\x99\r\nsoap? Dandruff on his shoulders. Scalp wants oiling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I want to see about that French horse that\xe2\x80\x99s running today, Bantam\r\nLyons said. Where the bugger is it?\r\n\r\nHe rustled the pleated pages, jerking his chin on his high collar.\r\nBarber\xe2\x80\x99s itch. Tight collar he\xe2\x80\x99ll lose his hair. Better leave him the\r\npaper and get shut of him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94You can keep it, Mr Bloom said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Ascot. Gold cup. Wait, Bantam Lyons muttered. Half a mo. Maximum the\r\nsecond.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I was just going to throw it away, Mr Bloom said.\r\n\r\nBantam Lyons raised his eyes suddenly and leered weakly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94What\xe2\x80\x99s that? his sharp voice said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I say you can keep it, Mr Bloom answered. I was going to throw it away\r\nthat moment.\r\n\r\nBantam Lyons doubted an instant, leering: then thrust the outspread\r\nsheets back on Mr Bloom\xe2\x80\x99s arms.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ll risk it, he said. Here, thanks.\r\n\r\nHe sped off towards Conway\xe2\x80\x99s corner. God speed scut.\r\n\r\nMr Bloom folded the sheets again to a neat square and lodged the soap\r\nin it, smiling. Silly lips of that chap. Betting. Regular hotbed of it\r\nlately. Messenger boys stealing to put on sixpence. Raffle for large\r\ntender turkey. Your Christmas dinner for threepence. Jack Fleming\r\nembezzling to gamble then smuggled off to America. Keeps a hotel now.\r\nThey never come back. Fleshpots of Egypt.\r\n\r\nHe walked cheerfully towards the mosque of the baths. Remind you of a\r\nmosque, redbaked bricks, the minarets. College sports today I see. He\r\neyed the horseshoe poster over the gate of college park: cyclist doubled\r\nup like a cod in a pot. Damn bad ad. Now if they had made it round\r\nlike a wheel. Then the spokes: sports, sports, sports: and the hub big:\r\ncollege. Something to catch the eye.\r\n\r\nThere\xe2\x80\x99s Hornblower standing at the porter\xe2\x80\x99s lodge. Keep him on hands:\r\nmight take a turn in there on the nod. How do you do, Mr Hornblower? How\r\ndo you do, sir?\r\n\r\nHeavenly weather really. If life was always like that. Cricket weather.\r\nSit around under sunshades. Over after over. Out. They can\xe2\x80\x99t play it\r\nhere. Duck for six wickets. Still Captain Culler broke a window in the\r\nKildare street club with a slog to square leg. Donnybrook fair more\r\nin their line. And the skulls we were acracking when M\xe2\x80\x99Carthy took the\r\nfloor. Heatwave. Won\xe2\x80\x99t last. Always passing, the stream of life, which\r\nin the stream of life we trace is dearer than them all.\r\n\r\nEnjoy a bath now: clean trough of water, cool enamel, the gentle tepid\r\nstream. This is my body.\r\n\r\nHe foresaw his pale body reclined in it at full, naked, in a womb of\r\nwarmth, oiled by scented melting soap, softly laved. He saw his\r\ntrunk and limbs riprippled over and sustained, buoyed lightly upward,\r\nlemonyellow: his navel, bud of flesh: and saw the dark tangled curls of\r\nhis bush floating, floating hair of the stream around the limp father of\r\nthousands, a languid floating flower.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[ 6 ]\r\n\r\nMartin Cunningham, first, poked his silkhatted head into the creaking\r\ncarriage and, entering deftly, seated himself. Mr Power stepped in after\r\nhim, curving his height with care.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Come on, Simon.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94After you, Mr Bloom said.\r\n\r\nMr Dedalus covered himself quickly and got in, saying:\r\n\r\n--Yes, yes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Are we all here now? Martin Cunningham asked. Come along, Bloom.\r\n\r\nMr Bloom entered and sat in the vacant place. He pulled the door to\r\nafter him and slammed it twice till it shut tight. He passed an arm\r\nthrough the armstrap and looked seriously from the open carriagewindow\r\nat the lowered blinds of the avenue. One dragged aside: an old woman\r\npeeping. Nose whiteflattened against the pane. Thanking her stars she\r\nwas passed over. Extraordinary the interest they take in a corpse. Glad\r\nto see us go we give them such trouble coming. Job seems to suit them.\r\nHuggermugger in corners. Slop about in slipperslappers for fear he\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nwake. Then getting it ready. Laying it out. Molly and Mrs Fleming making\r\nthe bed. Pull it more to your side. Our windingsheet. Never know who\r\nwill touch you dead. Wash and shampoo. I believe they clip the nails and\r\nthe hair. Keep a bit in an envelope. Grows all the same after. Unclean\r\njob.\r\n\r\nAll waited. Nothing was said. Stowing in the wreaths probably. I am\r\nsitting on something hard. Ah, that soap: in my hip pocket. Better shift\r\nit out of that. Wait for an opportunity.\r\n\r\nAll waited. Then wheels were heard from in front, turning: then nearer:\r\nthen horses\xe2\x80\x99 hoofs. A jolt. Their carriage began to move, creaking and\r\nswaying. Other hoofs and creaking wheels started behind. The blinds of\r\nthe avenue passed and number nine with its craped knocker, door ajar. At\r\nwalking pace.\r\n\r\nThey waited still, their knees jogging, till they had turned and were\r\npassing along the tramtracks. Tritonville road. Quicker. The wheels\r\nrattled rolling over the cobbled causeway and the crazy glasses shook\r\nrattling in the doorframes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94What way is he taking us? Mr Power asked through both windows.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Irishtown, Martin Cunningham said. Ringsend. Brunswick street.\r\n\r\nMr Dedalus nodded, looking out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94That\xe2\x80\x99s a fine old custom, he said. I am glad to see it has not died\r\nout.\r\n\r\nAll watched awhile through their windows caps and hats lifted by\r\npassers. Respect. The carriage swerved from the tramtrack to the\r\nsmoother road past Watery lane. Mr Bloom at gaze saw a lithe young man,\r\nclad in mourning, a wide hat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94There\xe2\x80\x99s a friend of yours gone by, Dedalus, he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Who is that?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Your son and heir.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Where is he? Mr Dedalus said, stretching over across.\r\n\r\nThe carriage, passing the open drains and mounds of rippedup roadway\r\nbefore the tenement houses, lurched round the corner and, swerving back\r\nto the tramtrack, rolled on noisily with chattering wheels. Mr Dedalus\r\nfell back, saying:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Was that Mulligan cad with him? His fidus Achates!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94No, Mr Bloom said. He was alone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Down with his aunt Sally, I suppose, Mr Dedalus said, the Goulding\r\nfaction, the drunken little costdrawer and Crissie, papa\xe2\x80\x99s little lump\r\nof dung, the wise child that knows her own father.\r\n\r\nMr Bloom smiled joylessly on Ringsend road. Wallace Bros: the\r\nbottleworks: Dodder bridge.\r\n\r\nRichie Goulding and the legal bag. Goulding, Collis and Ward he calls\r\nthe firm. His jokes are getting a bit damp. Great card he was. Waltzing\r\nin Stamer street with Ignatius Gallaher on a Sunday morning, the\r\nlandlady\xe2\x80\x99s two hats pinned on his head. Out on the rampage all night.\r\nBeginning to tell on him now: that backache of his, I fear. Wife ironing\r\nhis back. Thinks he\xe2\x80\x99ll cure it with pills. All breadcrumbs they are.\r\nAbout six hundred per cent profit.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94He\xe2\x80\x99s in with a lowdown crowd, Mr Dedalus snarled. That Mulligan is a\r\ncontaminated bloody doubledyed ruffian by all accounts. His name stinks\r\nall over Dublin. But with the help of God and His blessed mother I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nmake it my business to write a letter one of those days to his mother\r\nor his aunt or whatever she is that will open her eye as wide as a gate.\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll tickle his catastrophe, believe you me.\r\n\r\nHe cried above the clatter of the wheels:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I won\xe2\x80\x99t have her bastard of a nephew ruin my son. A counterjumper\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nson. Selling tapes in my cousin, Peter Paul M\xe2\x80\x99Swiney\xe2\x80\x99s. Not likely.\r\n\r\nHe ceased. Mr Bloom glanced from his angry moustache to Mr Power\xe2\x80\x99s mild\r\nface and Martin Cunningham\xe2\x80\x99s eyes and beard, gravely shaking. Noisy\r\nselfwilled man. Full of his son. He is right. Something to hand on. If\r\nlittle Rudy had lived. See him grow up. Hear his voice in the house.\r\nWalking beside Molly in an Eton suit. My son. Me in his eyes. Strange\r\nfeeling it would be. From me. Just a chance. Must have been that morning\r\nin Raymond terrace she was at the window watching the two dogs at it by\r\nthe wall of the cease to do evil. And the sergeant grinning up. She had\r\nthat cream gown on with the rip she never stitched. Give us a touch,\r\nPoldy. God, I\xe2\x80\x99m dying for it. How life begins.\r\n\r\nGot big then. Had to refuse the Greystones concert. My son inside her.\r\nI could have helped him on in life. I could. Make him independent. Learn\r\nGerman too.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Are we late? Mr Power asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Ten minutes, Martin Cunningham said, looking at his watch.\r\n\r\nMolly. Milly. Same thing watered down. Her tomboy oaths. O jumping\r\nJupiter! Ye gods and little fishes! Still, she\xe2\x80\x99s a dear girl. Soon be a\r\nwoman. Mullingar. Dearest Papli. Young student. Yes, yes: a woman too.\r\nLife, life.\r\n\r\nThe carriage heeled over and back, their four trunks swaying.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Corny might have given us a more commodious yoke, Mr Power said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94He might, Mr Dedalus said, if he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t that squint troubling him. Do\r\nyou follow me?\r\n\r\nHe closed his left eye. Martin Cunningham began to brush away\r\ncrustcrumbs from under his thighs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94What is this, he said, in the name of God? Crumbs?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Someone seems to have been making a picnic party here lately, Mr Power\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\nAll raised their thighs and eyed with disfavour the mildewed buttonless\r\nleather of the seats. Mr Dedalus, twisting his nose, frowned downward\r\nand said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Unless I\xe2\x80\x99m greatly mistaken. What do you think, Martin?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94It struck me too, Martin Cunningham said.\r\n\r\nMr Bloom set his thigh down. Glad I took that bath. Feel my feet quite\r\nclean. But I wish Mrs Fleming had darned these socks better.\r\n\r\nMr Dedalus sighed resignedly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94After all, he said, it\xe2\x80\x99s the most natural thing in the world.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Did Tom Kernan turn up? Martin Cunningham asked, twirling the peak of\r\nhis beard gently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Yes, Mr Bloom answered. He\xe2\x80\x99s behind with Ned Lambert and Hynes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94And Corny Kelleher himself? Mr Power asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94At the cemetery, Martin Cunningham said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I met M\xe2\x80\x99Coy this morning, Mr Bloom said. He said he\xe2\x80\x99d try to come.\r\n\r\nThe carriage halted short.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94What\xe2\x80\x99s wrong?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94We\xe2\x80\x99re stopped.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Where are we?\r\n\r\nMr Bloom put his head out of the window.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94The grand canal, he said.\r\n\r\nGasworks. Whooping cough they say it cures. Good job Milly never got\r\nit. Poor children! Doubles them up black and blue in convulsions. Shame\r\nreally. Got off lightly with illnesses compared. Only measles. Flaxseed\r\ntea. Scarlatina, influenza epidemics. Canvassing for death. Don\xe2\x80\x99t miss\r\nthis chance. Dogs\xe2\x80\x99 home over there. Poor old Athos! Be good to Athos,\r\nLeopold, is my last wish. Thy will be done. We obey them in the grave.\r\nA dying scrawl. He took it to heart, pined away. Quiet brute. Old men\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndogs usually are.\r\n\r\nA raindrop spat on his hat. He drew back and saw an instant of shower\r\nspray dots over the grey flags. Apart. Curious. Like through a colander.\r\nI thought it would. My boots were creaking I remember now.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94The weather is changing, he said quietly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94A pity it did not keep up fine, Martin Cunningham said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Wanted for the country, Mr Power said. There\xe2\x80\x99s the sun again coming\r\nout.\r\n\r\nMr Dedalus, peering through his glasses towards the veiled sun, hurled a\r\nmute curse at the sky.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94It\xe2\x80\x99s as uncertain as a child\xe2\x80\x99s bottom, he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94We\xe2\x80\x99re off again.\r\n\r\nThe carriage turned again its stiff wheels and their trunks swayed\r\ngently. Martin Cunningham twirled more quickly the peak of his beard.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Tom Kernan was immense last night, he said. And Paddy Leonard taking\r\nhim off to his face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94O, draw him out, Martin, Mr Power said eagerly. Wait till you hear him,\r\nSimon, on Ben Dollard\xe2\x80\x99s singing of The Croppy Boy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Immense, Martin Cunningham said pompously. His singing of that simple\r\nballad, Martin, is the most trenchant rendering I ever heard in the\r\nwhole course of my experience.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Trenchant, Mr Power said laughing. He\xe2\x80\x99s dead nuts on that. And the\r\nretrospective arrangement.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Did you read Dan Dawson\xe2\x80\x99s speech? Martin Cunningham asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I did not then, Mr Dedalus said. Where is it?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94In the paper this morning.\r\n\r\nMr Bloom took the paper from his inside pocket. That book I must change\r\nfor her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94No, no, Mr Dedalus said quickly. Later on please.\r\n\r\nMr Bloom\xe2\x80\x99s glance travelled down the edge of the paper, scanning the\r\ndeaths: Callan, Coleman, Dignam, Fawcett, Lowry, Naumann, Peake, what\r\nPeake is that? is it the chap was in Crosbie and Alleyne\xe2\x80\x99s? no, Sexton,\r\nUrbright. Inked characters fast fading on the frayed breaking paper.\r\nThanks to the Little Flower. Sadly missed. To the inexpressible grief of\r\nhis. Aged 88 after a long and tedious illness. Month\xe2\x80\x99s mind: Quinlan. On\r\nwhose soul Sweet Jesus have mercy.\r\n\r\n      It is now a month since dear Henry fled\r\n      To his home up above in the sky\r\n      While his family weeps and mourns his loss\r\n      Hoping some day to meet him on high.\r\n\r\nI tore up the envelope? Yes. Where did I put her letter after I read it\r\nin the bath? He patted his waistcoatpocket. There all right. Dear Henry\r\nfled. Before my patience are exhausted.\r\n\r\nNational school. Meade\xe2\x80\x99s yard. The hazard. Only two there now. Nodding.\r\nFull as a tick. Too much bone in their skulls. The other trotting round\r\nwith a fare. An hour ago I was passing there. The jarvies raised their\r\nhats.\r\n\r\nA pointsman\xe2\x80\x99s back straightened itself upright suddenly against a\r\ntramway standard by Mr Bloom\xe2\x80\x99s window. Couldn\xe2\x80\x99t they invent something\r\nautomatic so that the wheel itself much handier? Well but that fellow\r\nwould lose his job then? Well but then another fellow would get a job\r\nmaking the new invention?\r\n\r\nAntient concert rooms. Nothing on there. A man in a buff suit with a\r\ncrape armlet. Not much grief there. Quarter mourning. People in law\r\nperhaps.\r\n\r\nThey went past the bleak pulpit of saint Mark\xe2\x80\x99s, under the railway\r\nbridge, past the Queen\xe2\x80\x99s theatre: in silence. Hoardings: Eugene\r\nStratton, Mrs Bandmann Palmer. Could I go to see Leah tonight, I wonder.\r\nI said I. Or the Lily of Killarney? Elster Grimes Opera Company. Big\r\npowerful change. Wet bright bills for next week. Fun on the Bristol.\r\nMartin Cunningham could work a pass for the Gaiety. Have to stand a\r\ndrink or two. As broad as it\xe2\x80\x99s long.\r\n\r\nHe\xe2\x80\x99s coming in the afternoon. Her songs.\r\n\r\nPlasto\xe2\x80\x99s. Sir Philip Crampton\xe2\x80\x99s memorial fountain bust. Who was he?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94How do you do? Martin Cunningham said, raising his palm to his brow in\r\nsalute.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94He doesn\xe2\x80\x99t see us, Mr Power said. Yes, he does. How do you do?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Who? Mr Dedalus asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Blazes Boylan, Mr Power said. There he is airing his quiff.\r\n\r\nJust that moment I was thinking.\r\n\r\nMr Dedalus bent across to salute. From the door of the Red Bank the\r\nwhite disc of a straw hat flashed reply: spruce figure: passed.\r\n\r\nMr Bloom reviewed the nails of his left hand, then those of his right\r\nhand. The nails, yes. Is there anything more in him that they she sees?\r\nFascination. Worst man in Dublin. That keeps him alive. They sometimes\r\nfeel what a person is. Instinct. But a type like that. My nails. I\r\nam just looking at them: well pared. And after: thinking alone. Body\r\ngetting a bit softy. I would notice that: from remembering. What causes\r\nthat? I suppose the skin can\xe2\x80\x99t contract quickly enough when the flesh\r\nfalls off. But the shape is there. The shape is there still. Shoulders.\r\nHips. Plump. Night of the dance dressing. Shift stuck between the cheeks\r\nbehind.\r\n\r\nHe clasped his hands between his knees and, satisfied, sent his vacant\r\nglance over their faces.\r\n\r\nMr Power asked:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94How is the concert tour getting on, Bloom?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94O, very well, Mr Bloom said. I hear great accounts of it. It\xe2\x80\x99s a good\r\nidea, you see...\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Are you going yourself?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Well no, Mr Bloom said. In point of fact I have to go down to the\r\ncounty Clare on some private business. You see the idea is to tour the\r\nchief towns. What you lose on one you can make up on the other.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Quite so, Martin Cunningham said. Mary Anderson is up there now.\r\n\r\nHave you good artists?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Louis Werner is touring her, Mr Bloom said. O yes, we\xe2\x80\x99ll have all\r\ntopnobbers. J. C. Doyle and John MacCormack I hope and. The best, in\r\nfact.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94And Madame, Mr Power said smiling. Last but not least.\r\n\r\nMr Bloom unclasped his hands in a gesture of soft politeness and clasped\r\nthem. Smith O\xe2\x80\x99Brien. Someone has laid a bunch of flowers there. Woman.\r\nMust be his deathday. For many happy returns. The carriage wheeling by\r\nFarrell\xe2\x80\x99s statue united noiselessly their unresisting knees.\r\n\r\nOot: a dullgarbed old man from the curbstone tendered his wares, his\r\nmouth opening: oot.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Four bootlaces for a penny.\r\n\r\nWonder why he was struck off the rolls. Had his office in Hume street.\r\nSame house as Molly\xe2\x80\x99s namesake, Tweedy, crown solicitor for Waterford.\r\nHas that silk hat ever since. Relics of old decency. Mourning too.\r\nTerrible comedown, poor wretch! Kicked about like snuff at a wake.\r\nO\xe2\x80\x99Callaghan on his last legs.\r\n\r\nAnd Madame. Twenty past eleven. Up. Mrs Fleming is in to clean. Doing\r\nher hair, humming: voglio e non vorrei. No: vorrei e non. Looking at\r\nthe tips of her hairs to see if they are split. Mi trema un poco il.\r\nBeautiful on that tre her voice is: weeping tone. A thrush. A throstle.\r\nThere is a word throstle that expresses that.\r\n\r\nHis eyes passed lightly over Mr Power\xe2\x80\x99s goodlooking face. Greyish over\r\nthe ears. Madame: smiling. I smiled back. A smile goes a long way. Only\r\npoliteness perhaps. Nice fellow. Who knows is that true about the woman\r\nhe keeps? Not pleasant for the wife. Yet they say, who was it told me,\r\nthere is no carnal. You would imagine that would get played out pretty\r\nquick. Yes, it was Crofton met him one evening bringing her a pound of\r\nrumpsteak. What is this she was? Barmaid in Jury\xe2\x80\x99s. Or the Moira, was\r\nit?\r\n\r\nThey passed under the hugecloaked Liberator\xe2\x80\x99s form.\r\n\r\nMartin Cunningham nudged Mr Power.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Of the tribe of Reuben, he said.\r\n\r\nA tall blackbearded figure, bent on a stick, stumping round the corner\r\nof Elvery\xe2\x80\x99s Elephant house, showed them a curved hand open on his spine.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94In all his pristine beauty, Mr Power said.\r\n\r\nMr Dedalus looked after the stumping figure and said mildly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94The devil break the hasp of your back!\r\n\r\nMr Power, collapsing in laughter, shaded his face from the window as the\r\ncarriage passed Gray\xe2\x80\x99s statue.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94We have all been there, Martin Cunningham said broadly.\r\n\r\nHis eyes met Mr Bloom\xe2\x80\x99s eyes. He caressed his beard, adding:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Well, nearly all of us.\r\n\r\nMr Bloom began to speak with sudden eagerness to his companions\xe2\x80\x99 faces.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94That\xe2\x80\x99s an awfully good one that\xe2\x80\x99s going the rounds about Reuben J and\r\nthe son.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94About the boatman? Mr Power asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Yes. Isn\xe2\x80\x99t it awfully good?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94What is that? Mr Dedalus asked. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t hear it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94There was a girl in the case, Mr Bloom began, and he determined to send\r\nhim to the Isle of Man out of harm\xe2\x80\x99s way but when they were both.....\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94What? Mr Dedalus asked. That confirmed bloody hobbledehoy is it?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Yes, Mr Bloom said. They were both on the way to the boat and he tried\r\nto drown.....\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Drown Barabbas! Mr Dedalus cried. I wish to Christ he did!\r\n\r\nMr Power sent a long laugh down his shaded nostrils.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94No, Mr Bloom said, the son himself.....\r\n\r\nMartin Cunningham thwarted his speech rudely:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Reuben J and the son were piking it down the quay next the river on\r\ntheir way to the Isle of Man boat and the young chiseller suddenly got\r\nloose and over the wall with him into the Liffey.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94For God\xe2\x80\x99s sake! Mr Dedalus exclaimed in fright. Is he dead?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Dead! Martin Cunningham cried. Not he! A boatman got a pole and fished\r\nhim out by the slack of the breeches and he was landed up to the father\r\non the quay more dead than alive. Half the town was there.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Yes, Mr Bloom said. But the funny part is.....\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94And Reuben J, Martin Cunningham said, gave the boatman a florin for\r\nsaving his son\xe2\x80\x99s life.\r\n\r\nA stifled sigh came from under Mr Power\xe2\x80\x99s hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94O, he did, Martin Cunningham affirmed. Like a hero. A silver florin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Isn\xe2\x80\x99t it awfully good? Mr Bloom said eagerly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94One and eightpence too much, Mr Dedalus said drily.\r\n\r\nMr Power\xe2\x80\x99s choked laugh burst quietly in the carriage.\r\n\r\nNelson\xe2\x80\x99s pillar.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Eight plums a penny! Eight for a penny!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94We had better look a little serious, Martin Cunningham said.\r\n\r\nMr Dedalus sighed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Ah then indeed, he said, poor little Paddy wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t grudge us a laugh.\r\nMany a good one he told himself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94The Lord forgive me! Mr Power said, wiping his wet eyes with his\r\nfingers. Poor Paddy! I little thought a week ago when I saw him last and\r\nhe was in his usual health that I\xe2\x80\x99d be driving after him like this. He\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngone from us.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94As decent a little man as ever wore a hat, Mr Dedalus said. He went\r\nvery suddenly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Breakdown, Martin Cunningham said. Heart.\r\n\r\nHe tapped his chest sadly.\r\n\r\nBlazing face: redhot. Too much John Barleycorn. Cure for a red nose.\r\nDrink like the devil till it turns adelite. A lot of money he spent\r\ncolouring it.\r\n\r\nMr Power gazed at the passing houses with rueful apprehension.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94He had a sudden death, poor fellow, he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94The best death, Mr Bloom said.\r\n\r\nTheir wide open eyes looked at him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94No suffering, he said. A moment and all is over. Like dying in sleep.\r\n\r\nNo-one spoke.\r\n\r\nDead side of the street this. Dull business by day, land agents,\r\ntemperance hotel, Falconer\xe2\x80\x99s railway guide, civil service college,\r\nGill\xe2\x80\x99s, catholic club, the industrious blind. Why? Some reason. Sun or\r\nwind. At night too. Chummies and slaveys. Under the patronage of the\r\nlate Father Mathew. Foundation stone for Parnell. Breakdown. Heart.\r\n\r\nWhite horses with white frontlet plumes came round the Rotunda corner,\r\ngalloping. A tiny coffin flashed by. In a hurry to bury. A mourning\r\ncoach. Unmarried. Black for the married. Piebald for bachelors. Dun for\r\na nun.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Sad, Martin Cunningham said. A child.\r\n\r\nA dwarf\xe2\x80\x99s face, mauve and wrinkled like little Rudy\xe2\x80\x99s was. Dwarf\xe2\x80\x99s body,\r\nweak as putty, in a whitelined deal box. Burial friendly society\r\npays. Penny a week for a sod of turf. Our. Little. Beggar. Baby. Meant\r\nnothing. Mistake of nature. If it\xe2\x80\x99s healthy it\xe2\x80\x99s from the mother. If not\r\nfrom the man. Better luck next time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Poor little thing, Mr Dedalus said. It\xe2\x80\x99s well out of it.\r\n\r\nThe carriage climbed more slowly the hill of Rutland square. Rattle his\r\nbones. Over the stones. Only a pauper. Nobody owns.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94In the midst of life, Martin Cunningham said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94But the worst of all, Mr Power said, is the man who takes his own life.\r\n\r\nMartin Cunningham drew out his watch briskly, coughed and put it back.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94The greatest disgrace to have in the family, Mr Power added.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Temporary insanity, of course, Martin Cunningham said decisively. We\r\nmust take a charitable view of it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94They say a man who does it is a coward, Mr Dedalus said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94It is not for us to judge, Martin Cunningham said.\r\n\r\nMr Bloom, about to speak, closed his lips again. Martin Cunningham\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlarge eyes. Looking away now. Sympathetic human man he is. Intelligent.\r\nLike Shakespeare\xe2\x80\x99s face. Always a good word to say. They have no mercy\r\non that here or infanticide. Refuse christian burial. They used to drive\r\na stake of wood through his heart in the grave. As if it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t broken\r\nalready. Yet sometimes they repent too late. Found in the riverbed\r\nclutching rushes. He looked at me. And that awful drunkard of a wife\r\nof his. Setting up house for her time after time and then pawning the\r\nfurniture on him every Saturday almost. Leading him the life of the\r\ndamned. Wear the heart out of a stone, that. Monday morning. Start\r\nafresh. Shoulder to the wheel. Lord, she must have looked a sight\r\nthat night Dedalus told me he was in there. Drunk about the place and\r\ncapering with Martin\xe2\x80\x99s umbrella.\r\n\r\n     And they call me the jewel of Asia,\r\n     Of Asia,\r\n     The geisha.\r\n\r\nHe looked away from me. He knows. Rattle his bones.\r\n\r\nThat afternoon of the inquest. The redlabelled bottle on the table. The\r\nroom in the hotel with hunting pictures. Stuffy it was. Sunlight through\r\nthe slats of the Venetian blind. The coroner\xe2\x80\x99s sunlit ears, big and\r\nhairy. Boots giving evidence. Thought he was asleep first. Then saw like\r\nyellow streaks on his face. Had slipped down to the foot of the bed.\r\nVerdict: overdose. Death by misadventure. The letter. For my son\r\nLeopold.\r\n\r\nNo more pain. Wake no more. Nobody owns.\r\n\r\nThe carriage rattled swiftly along Blessington street. Over the stones.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94We are going the pace, I think, Martin Cunningham said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94God grant he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t upset us on the road, Mr Power said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I hope not, Martin Cunningham said. That will be a great race tomorrow\r\nin Germany. The Gordon Bennett.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Yes, by Jove, Mr Dedalus said. That will be worth seeing, faith.\r\n\r\nAs they turned into Berkeley street a streetorgan near the Basin sent\r\nover and after them a rollicking rattling song of the halls. Has anybody\r\nhere seen Kelly? Kay ee double ell wy. Dead March from Saul. He\xe2\x80\x99s as\r\nbad as old Antonio. He left me on my ownio. Pirouette! The Mater\r\nMisericordiae. Eccles street. My house down there. Big place. Ward for\r\nincurables there. Very encouraging. Our Lady\xe2\x80\x99s Hospice for the dying.\r\nDeadhouse handy underneath. Where old Mrs Riordan died. They look\r\nterrible the women. Her feeding cup and rubbing her mouth with the\r\nspoon. Then the screen round her bed for her to die. Nice young student\r\nthat was dressed that bite the bee gave me. He\xe2\x80\x99s gone over to the\r\nlying-in hospital they told me. From one extreme to the other.\r\n\r\nThe carriage galloped round a corner: stopped.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94What\xe2\x80\x99s wrong now?\r\n\r\nA divided drove of branded cattle passed the windows, lowing, slouching\r\nby on padded hoofs, whisking their tails slowly on their clotted bony\r\ncroups. Outside them and through them ran raddled sheep bleating their\r\nfear.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Emigrants, Mr Power said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Huuuh! the drover\xe2\x80\x99s voice cried, his switch sounding on their flanks.\r\nHuuuh! out of that!\r\n\r\nThursday, of course. Tomorrow is killing day. Springers. Cuffe sold them\r\nabout twentyseven quid each. For Liverpool probably. Roastbeef for old\r\nEngland. They buy up all the juicy ones. And then the fifth quarter\r\nlost: all that raw stuff, hide, hair, horns. Comes to a big thing in a\r\nyear. Dead meat trade. Byproducts of the slaughterhouses for tanneries,\r\nsoap, margarine. Wonder if that dodge works now getting dicky meat off\r\nthe train at Clonsilla.\r\n\r\nThe carriage moved on through the drove.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I can\xe2\x80\x99t make out why the corporation doesn\xe2\x80\x99t run a tramline from the\r\nparkgate to the quays, Mr Bloom said. All those animals could be taken\r\nin trucks down to the boats.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Instead of blocking up the thoroughfare, Martin Cunningham said. Quite\r\nright. They ought to.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Yes, Mr Bloom said, and another thing I often thought, is to have\r\nmunicipal funeral trams like they have in Milan, you know. Run the line\r\nout to the cemetery gates and have special trams, hearse and carriage\r\nand all. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you see what I mean?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94O, that be damned for a story, Mr Dedalus said. Pullman car and saloon\r\ndiningroom.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94A poor lookout for Corny, Mr Power added.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Why? Mr Bloom asked, turning to Mr Dedalus. Wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t it be more decent\r\nthan galloping two abreast?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Well, there\xe2\x80\x99s something in that, Mr Dedalus granted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94And, Martin Cunningham said, we wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have scenes like that when the\r\nhearse capsized round Dunphy\xe2\x80\x99s and upset the coffin on to the road.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94That was terrible, Mr Power\xe2\x80\x99s shocked face said, and the corpse fell\r\nabout the road. Terrible!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94First round Dunphy\xe2\x80\x99s, Mr Dedalus said, nodding. Gordon Bennett cup.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Praises be to God! Martin Cunningham said piously.\r\n\r\nBom! Upset. A coffin bumped out on to the road. Burst open. Paddy Dignam\r\nshot out and rolling over stiff in the dust in a brown habit too large\r\nfor him. Red face: grey now. Mouth fallen open. Asking what\xe2\x80\x99s up now.\r\nQuite right to close it. Looks horrid open. Then the insides decompose\r\nquickly. Much better to close up all the orifices. Yes, also. With wax.\r\nThe sphincter loose. Seal up all.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Dunphy\xe2\x80\x99s, Mr Power announced as the carriage turned right.\r\n\r\nDunphy\xe2\x80\x99s corner. Mourning coaches drawn up, drowning their grief. A\r\npause by the wayside. Tiptop position for a pub. Expect we\xe2\x80\x99ll pull up\r\nhere on the way back to drink his health. Pass round the consolation.\r\nElixir of life.\r\n\r\nBut suppose now it did happen. Would he bleed if a nail say cut him\r\nin the knocking about? He would and he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t, I suppose. Depends on\r\nwhere. The circulation stops. Still some might ooze out of an artery. It\r\nwould be better to bury them in red: a dark red.\r\n\r\nIn silence they drove along Phibsborough road. An empty hearse trotted\r\nby, coming from the cemetery: looks relieved.\r\n\r\nCrossguns bridge: the royal canal.\r\n\r\nWater rushed roaring through the sluices. A man stood on his\r\ndropping barge, between clamps of turf. On the towpath by the lock a\r\nslacktethered horse. Aboard of the Bugabu.\r\n\r\nTheir eyes watched him. On the slow weedy waterway he had floated on his\r\nraft coastward over Ireland drawn by a haulage rope past beds of\r\nreeds, over slime, mudchoked bottles, carrion dogs. Athlone, Mullingar,\r\nMoyvalley, I could make a walking tour to see Milly by the canal. Or\r\ncycle down. Hire some old crock, safety. Wren had one the other day at\r\nthe auction but a lady\xe2\x80\x99s. Developing waterways. James M\xe2\x80\x99Cann\xe2\x80\x99s hobby\r\nto row me o\xe2\x80\x99er the ferry. Cheaper transit. By easy stages. Houseboats.\r\nCamping out. Also hearses. To heaven by water. Perhaps I will without\r\nwriting. Come as a surprise, Leixlip, Clonsilla. Dropping down lock by\r\nlock to Dublin. With turf from the midland bogs. Salute. He lifted his\r\nbrown straw hat, saluting Paddy Dignam.\r\n\r\nThey drove on past Brian Boroimhe house. Near it now.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I wonder how is our friend Fogarty getting on, Mr Power said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Better ask Tom Kernan, Mr Dedalus said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94How is that? Martin Cunningham said. Left him weeping, I suppose?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Though lost to sight, Mr Dedalus said, to memory dear.\r\n\r\nThe carriage steered left for Finglas road.\r\n\r\nThe stonecutter\xe2\x80\x99s yard on the right. Last lap. Crowded on the spit of\r\nland silent shapes appeared, white, sorrowful, holding out calm hands,\r\nknelt in grief, pointing. Fragments of shapes, hewn. In white silence:\r\nappealing. The best obtainable. Thos. H. Dennany, monumental builder and\r\nsculptor.\r\n\r\nPassed.\r\n\r\nOn the curbstone before Jimmy Geary, the sexton\xe2\x80\x99s, an old tramp sat,\r\ngrumbling, emptying the dirt and stones out of his huge dustbrown\r\nyawning boot. After life\xe2\x80\x99s journey.\r\n\r\nGloomy gardens then went by: one by one: gloomy houses.\r\n\r\nMr Power pointed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94That is where Childs was murdered, he said. The last house.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94So it is, Mr Dedalus said. A gruesome case. Seymour Bushe got him off.\r\nMurdered his brother. Or so they said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94The crown had no evidence, Mr Power said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Only circumstantial, Martin Cunningham added. That\xe2\x80\x99s the maxim of the\r\nlaw. Better for ninetynine guilty to escape than for one innocent person\r\nto be wrongfully condemned.\r\n\r\nThey looked. Murderer\xe2\x80\x99s ground. It passed darkly. Shuttered, tenantless,\r\nunweeded garden. Whole place gone to hell. Wrongfully condemned. Murder.\r\nThe murderer\xe2\x80\x99s image in the eye of the murdered. They love reading about\r\nit. Man\xe2\x80\x99s head found in a garden. Her clothing consisted of. How she met\r\nher death. Recent outrage. The weapon used. Murderer is still at large.\r\nClues. A shoelace. The body to be exhumed. Murder will out.\r\n\r\nCramped in this carriage. She mightn\xe2\x80\x99t like me to come that way without\r\nletting her know. Must be careful about women. Catch them once with\r\ntheir pants down. Never forgive you after. Fifteen.\r\n\r\nThe high railings of Prospect rippled past their gaze. Dark poplars,\r\nrare white forms. Forms more frequent, white shapes thronged amid the\r\ntrees, white forms and fragments streaming by mutely, sustaining vain\r\ngestures on the air.\r\n\r\nThe felly harshed against the curbstone: stopped. Martin Cunningham put\r\nout his arm and, wrenching back the handle, shoved the door open with\r\nhis knee. He stepped out. Mr Power and Mr Dedalus followed.\r\n\r\nChange that soap now. Mr Bloom\xe2\x80\x99s hand unbuttoned his hip pocket swiftly\r\nand transferred the paperstuck soap to his inner handkerchief pocket.\r\nHe stepped out of the carriage, replacing the newspaper his other hand\r\nstill held.\r\n\r\nPaltry funeral: coach and three carriages. It\xe2\x80\x99s all the same.\r\nPallbearers, gold reins, requiem mass, firing a volley. Pomp of death.\r\nBeyond the hind carriage a hawker stood by his barrow of cakes and\r\nfruit. Simnel cakes those are, stuck together: cakes for the dead.\r\nDogbiscuits. Who ate them? Mourners coming out.\r\n\r\nHe followed his companions. Mr Kernan and Ned Lambert followed, Hynes\r\nwalking after them. Corny Kelleher stood by the opened hearse and took\r\nout the two wreaths. He handed one to the boy.\r\n\r\nWhere is that child\xe2\x80\x99s funeral disappeared to?\r\n\r\nA team of horses passed from Finglas with toiling plodding tread,\r\ndragging through the funereal silence a creaking waggon on which lay a\r\ngranite block. The waggoner marching at their head saluted.\r\n\r\nCoffin now. Got here before us, dead as he is. Horse looking round at it\r\nwith his plume skeowways. Dull eye: collar tight on his neck, pressing\r\non a bloodvessel or something. Do they know what they cart out here\r\nevery day? Must be twenty or thirty funerals every day. Then Mount\r\nJerome for the protestants. Funerals all over the world everywhere every\r\nminute. Shovelling them under by the cartload doublequick. Thousands\r\nevery hour. Too many in the world.\r\n\r\nMourners came out through the gates: woman and a girl. Leanjawed harpy,\r\nhard woman at a bargain, her bonnet awry. Girl\xe2\x80\x99s face stained with dirt\r\nand tears, holding the woman\xe2\x80\x99s arm, looking up at her for a sign to cry.\r\nFish\xe2\x80\x99s face, bloodless and livid.\r\n\r\nThe mutes shouldered the coffin and bore it in through the gates. So\r\nmuch dead weight. Felt heavier myself stepping out of that bath. First\r\nthe stiff: then the friends of the stiff. Corny Kelleher and the\r\nboy followed with their wreaths. Who is that beside them? Ah, the\r\nbrother-in-law.\r\n\r\nAll walked after.\r\n\r\nMartin Cunningham whispered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I was in mortal agony with you talking of suicide before Bloom.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94What? Mr Power whispered. How so?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94His father poisoned himself, Martin Cunningham whispered. Had the\r\nQueen\xe2\x80\x99s hotel in Ennis. You heard him say he was going to Clare.\r\nAnniversary.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94O God! Mr Power whispered. First I heard of it. Poisoned himself?\r\n\r\nHe glanced behind him to where a face with dark thinking eyes followed\r\ntowards the cardinal\xe2\x80\x99s mausoleum. Speaking.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Was he insured? Mr Bloom asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I believe so, Mr Kernan answered. But the policy was heavily mortgaged.\r\nMartin is trying to get the youngster into Artane.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94How many children did he leave?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Five. Ned Lambert says he\xe2\x80\x99ll try to get one of the girls into Todd\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94A sad case, Mr Bloom said gently. Five young children.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94A great blow to the poor wife, Mr Kernan added.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Indeed yes, Mr Bloom agreed.\r\n\r\nHas the laugh at him now.\r\n\r\nHe looked down at the boots he had blacked and polished. She had\r\noutlived him. Lost her husband. More dead for her than for me. One must\r\noutlive the other. Wise men say. There are more women than men in the\r\nworld. Condole with her. Your terrible loss. I hope you\xe2\x80\x99ll soon follow\r\nhim. For Hindu widows only. She would marry another. Him? No. Yet who\r\nknows after. Widowhood not the thing since the old queen died. Drawn on\r\na guncarriage. Victoria and Albert. Frogmore memorial mourning. But\r\nin the end she put a few violets in her bonnet. Vain in her heart of\r\nhearts. All for a shadow. Consort not even a king. Her son was the\r\nsubstance. Something new to hope for not like the past she wanted back,\r\nwaiting. It never comes. One must go first: alone, under the ground: and\r\nlie no more in her warm bed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94How are you, Simon? Ned Lambert said softly, clasping hands. Haven\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nseen you for a month of Sundays.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Never better. How are all in Cork\xe2\x80\x99s own town?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I was down there for the Cork park races on Easter Monday, Ned Lambert\r\nsaid. Same old six and eightpence. Stopped with Dick Tivy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94And how is Dick, the solid man?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Nothing between himself and heaven, Ned Lambert answered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94By the holy Paul! Mr Dedalus said in subdued wonder. Dick Tivy bald?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Martin is going to get up a whip for the youngsters, Ned Lambert said,\r\npointing ahead. A few bob a skull. Just to keep them going till the\r\ninsurance is cleared up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Yes, yes, Mr Dedalus said dubiously. Is that the eldest boy in front?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Yes, Ned Lambert said, with the wife\xe2\x80\x99s brother. John Henry Menton is\r\nbehind. He put down his name for a quid.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ll engage he did, Mr Dedalus said. I often told poor Paddy he ought\r\nto mind that job. John Henry is not the worst in the world.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94How did he lose it? Ned Lambert asked. Liquor, what?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Many a good man\xe2\x80\x99s fault, Mr Dedalus said with a sigh.\r\n\r\nThey halted about the door of the mortuary chapel. Mr Bloom stood behind\r\nthe boy with the wreath looking down at his sleekcombed hair and at the\r\nslender furrowed neck inside his brandnew collar. Poor boy! Was he there\r\nwhen the father? Both unconscious. Lighten up at the last moment\r\nand recognise for the last time. All he might have done. I owe three\r\nshillings to O\xe2\x80\x99Grady. Would he understand? The mutes bore the coffin\r\ninto the chapel. Which end is his head?\r\n\r\nAfter a moment he followed the others in, blinking in the screened\r\nlight. The coffin lay on its bier before the chancel, four tall yellow\r\ncandles at its corners. Always in front of us. Corny Kelleher, laying a\r\nwreath at each fore corner, beckoned to the boy to kneel. The mourners\r\nknelt here and there in prayingdesks. Mr Bloom stood behind near the\r\nfont and, when all had knelt, dropped carefully his unfolded newspaper\r\nfrom his pocket and knelt his right knee upon it. He fitted his black\r\nhat gently on his left knee and, holding its brim, bent over piously.\r\n\r\nA server bearing a brass bucket with something in it came out through a\r\ndoor. The whitesmocked priest came after him, tidying his stole with one\r\nhand, balancing with the other a little book against his toad\xe2\x80\x99s belly.\r\nWho\xe2\x80\x99ll read the book? I, said the rook.\r\n\r\nThey halted by the bier and the priest began to read out of his book\r\nwith a fluent croak.\r\n\r\nFather Coffey. I knew his name was like a coffin. Dominenamine. Bully\r\nabout the muzzle he looks. Bosses the show. Muscular christian. Woe\r\nbetide anyone that looks crooked at him: priest. Thou art Peter. Burst\r\nsideways like a sheep in clover Dedalus says he will. With a belly on\r\nhim like a poisoned pup. Most amusing expressions that man finds. Hhhn:\r\nburst sideways.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Non intres in judicium cum servo tuo, Domine.\r\n\r\nMakes them feel more important to be prayed over in Latin. Requiem mass.\r\nCrape weepers. Blackedged notepaper. Your name on the altarlist. Chilly\r\nplace this. Want to feed well, sitting in there all the morning in the\r\ngloom kicking his heels waiting for the next please. Eyes of a toad too.\r\nWhat swells him up that way? Molly gets swelled after cabbage. Air of\r\nthe place maybe. Looks full up of bad gas. Must be an infernal lot\r\nof bad gas round the place. Butchers, for instance: they get like raw\r\nbeefsteaks. Who was telling me? Mervyn Browne. Down in the vaults of\r\nsaint Werburgh\xe2\x80\x99s lovely old organ hundred and fifty they have to bore a\r\nhole in the coffins sometimes to let out the bad gas and burn it. Out it\r\nrushes: blue. One whiff of that and you\xe2\x80\x99re a goner.\r\n\r\nMy kneecap is hurting me. Ow. That\xe2\x80\x99s better.\r\n\r\nThe priest took a stick with a knob at the end of it out of the boy\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbucket and shook it over the coffin. Then he walked to the other end and\r\nshook it again. Then he came back and put it back in the bucket. As you\r\nwere before you rested. It\xe2\x80\x99s all written down: he has to do it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Et ne nos inducas in tentationem.\r\n\r\nThe server piped the answers in the treble. I often thought it would be\r\nbetter to have boy servants. Up to fifteen or so. After that, of course\r\n...\r\n\r\nHoly water that was, I expect. Shaking sleep out of it. He must be fed\r\nup with that job, shaking that thing over all the corpses they trot up.\r\nWhat harm if he could see what he was shaking it over. Every mortal\r\nday a fresh batch: middleaged men, old women, children, women dead in\r\nchildbirth, men with beards, baldheaded businessmen, consumptive girls\r\nwith little sparrows\xe2\x80\x99 breasts. All the year round he prayed the same\r\nthing over them all and shook water on top of them: sleep. On Dignam\r\nnow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94In paradisum.\r\n\r\nSaid he was going to paradise or is in paradise. Says that over\r\neverybody. Tiresome kind of a job. But he has to say something.\r\n\r\nThe priest closed his book and went off, followed by the server. Corny\r\nKelleher opened the sidedoors and the gravediggers came in, hoisted the\r\ncoffin again, carried it out and shoved it on their cart. Corny Kelleher\r\ngave one wreath to the boy and one to the brother-in-law. All followed\r\nthem out of the sidedoors into the mild grey air. Mr Bloom came last\r\nfolding his paper again into his pocket. He gazed gravely at the ground\r\ntill the coffincart wheeled off to the left. The metal wheels ground the\r\ngravel with a sharp grating cry and the pack of blunt boots followed the\r\ntrundled barrow along a lane of sepulchres.\r\n\r\nThe ree the ra the ree the ra the roo. Lord, I mustn\xe2\x80\x99t lilt here.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94The O\xe2\x80\x99Connell circle, Mr Dedalus said about him.\r\n\r\nMr Power\xe2\x80\x99s soft eyes went up to the apex of the lofty cone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94He\xe2\x80\x99s at rest, he said, in the middle of his people, old Dan O\xe2\x80\x99. But his\r\nheart is buried in Rome. How many broken hearts are buried here, Simon!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Her grave is over there, Jack, Mr Dedalus said. I\xe2\x80\x99ll soon be stretched\r\nbeside her. Let Him take me whenever He likes.\r\n\r\nBreaking down, he began to weep to himself quietly, stumbling a little\r\nin his walk. Mr Power took his arm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94She\xe2\x80\x99s better where she is, he said kindly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I suppose so, Mr Dedalus said with a weak gasp. I suppose she is in\r\nheaven if there is a heaven.\r\n\r\nCorny Kelleher stepped aside from his rank and allowed the mourners to\r\nplod by.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Sad occasions, Mr Kernan began politely.\r\n\r\nMr Bloom closed his eyes and sadly twice bowed his head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94The others are putting on their hats, Mr Kernan said. I suppose we can\r\ndo so too. We are the last. This cemetery is a treacherous place.\r\n\r\nThey covered their heads.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94The reverend gentleman read the service too quickly, don\xe2\x80\x99t you think?\r\nMr Kernan said with reproof.\r\n\r\nMr Bloom nodded gravely looking in the quick bloodshot eyes. Secret\r\neyes, secretsearching. Mason, I think: not sure. Beside him again. We\r\nare the last. In the same boat. Hope he\xe2\x80\x99ll say something else.\r\n\r\nMr Kernan added:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94The service of the Irish church used in Mount Jerome is simpler, more\r\nimpressive I must say.\r\n\r\nMr Bloom gave prudent assent. The language of course was another thing.\r\n\r\nMr Kernan said with solemnity:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I am the resurrection and the life. That touches a man\xe2\x80\x99s inmost heart.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94It does, Mr Bloom said.\r\n\r\nYour heart perhaps but what price the fellow in the six feet by two\r\nwith his toes to the daisies? No touching that. Seat of the affections.\r\nBroken heart. A pump after all, pumping thousands of gallons of blood\r\nevery day. One fine day it gets bunged up: and there you are. Lots of\r\nthem lying around here: lungs, hearts, livers. Old rusty pumps: damn\r\nthe thing else. The resurrection and the life. Once you are dead you are\r\ndead. That last day idea. Knocking them all up out of their graves. Come\r\nforth, Lazarus! And he came fifth and lost the job. Get up! Last day!\r\nThen every fellow mousing around for his liver and his lights and the\r\nrest of his traps. Find damn all of himself that morning. Pennyweight of\r\npowder in a skull. Twelve grammes one pennyweight. Troy measure.\r\n\r\nCorny Kelleher fell into step at their side.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Everything went off A1, he said. What?\r\n\r\nHe looked on them from his drawling eye. Policeman\xe2\x80\x99s shoulders. With\r\nyour tooraloom tooraloom.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94As it should be, Mr Kernan said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94What? Eh? Corny Kelleher said.\r\n\r\nMr Kernan assured him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Who is that chap behind with Tom Kernan? John Henry Menton asked. I\r\nknow his face.\r\n\r\nNed Lambert glanced back.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Bloom, he said, Madame Marion Tweedy that was, is, I mean, the soprano.\r\nShe\xe2\x80\x99s his wife.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94O, to be sure, John Henry Menton said. I haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen her for some\r\ntime. She was a finelooking woman. I danced with her, wait, fifteen\r\nseventeen golden years ago, at Mat Dillon\xe2\x80\x99s in Roundtown. And a good\r\narmful she was.\r\n\r\nHe looked behind through the others.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94What is he? he asked. What does he do? Wasn\xe2\x80\x99t he in the stationery\r\nline? I fell foul of him one evening, I remember, at bowls.\r\n\r\nNed Lambert smiled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Yes, he was, he said, in Wisdom Hely\xe2\x80\x99s. A traveller for blottingpaper.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94In God\xe2\x80\x99s name, John Henry Menton said, what did she marry a coon like\r\nthat for? She had plenty of game in her then.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Has still, Ned Lambert said. He does some canvassing for ads.\r\n\r\nJohn Henry Menton\xe2\x80\x99s large eyes stared ahead.\r\n\r\nThe barrow turned into a side lane. A portly man, ambushed among the\r\ngrasses, raised his hat in homage. The gravediggers touched their caps.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94John O\xe2\x80\x99Connell, Mr Power said pleased. He never forgets a friend.\r\n\r\nMr O\xe2\x80\x99Connell shook all their hands in silence. Mr Dedalus said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I am come to pay you another visit.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94My dear Simon, the caretaker answered in a low voice. I don\xe2\x80\x99t want your\r\ncustom at all.\r\n\r\nSaluting Ned Lambert and John Henry Menton he walked on at Martin\r\nCunningham\xe2\x80\x99s side puzzling two long keys at his back.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Did you hear that one, he asked them, about Mulcahy from the Coombe?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I did not, Martin Cunningham said.\r\n\r\nThey bent their silk hats in concert and Hynes inclined his ear. The\r\ncaretaker hung his thumbs in the loops of his gold watchchain and spoke\r\nin a discreet tone to their vacant smiles.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94They tell the story, he said, that two drunks came out here one foggy\r\nevening to look for the grave of a friend of theirs. They asked for\r\nMulcahy from the Coombe and were told where he was buried. After\r\ntraipsing about in the fog they found the grave sure enough. One of the\r\ndrunks spelt out the name: Terence Mulcahy. The other drunk was blinking\r\nup at a statue of Our Saviour the widow had got put up.\r\n\r\nThe caretaker blinked up at one of the sepulchres they passed. He\r\nresumed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94And, after blinking up at the sacred figure, Not a bloody bit like the\r\nman, says he. That\xe2\x80\x99s not Mulcahy, says he, whoever done it.\r\n\r\nRewarded by smiles he fell back and spoke with Corny Kelleher, accepting\r\nthe dockets given him, turning them over and scanning them as he walked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94That\xe2\x80\x99s all done with a purpose, Martin Cunningham explained to Hynes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I know, Hynes said. I know that.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94To cheer a fellow up, Martin Cunningham said. It\xe2\x80\x99s pure\r\ngoodheartedness: damn the thing else.\r\n\r\nMr Bloom admired the caretaker\xe2\x80\x99s prosperous bulk. All want to be on good\r\nterms with him. Decent fellow, John O\xe2\x80\x99Connell, real good sort. Keys:\r\nlike Keyes\xe2\x80\x99s ad: no fear of anyone getting out. No passout checks.\r\nHabeas corpus. I must see about that ad after the funeral. Did I write\r\nBallsbridge on the envelope I took to cover when she disturbed me\r\nwriting to Martha? Hope it\xe2\x80\x99s not chucked in the dead letter office. Be\r\nthe better of a shave. Grey sprouting beard. That\xe2\x80\x99s the first sign when\r\nthe hairs come out grey. And temper getting cross. Silver threads among\r\nthe grey. Fancy being his wife. Wonder he had the gumption to propose to\r\nany girl. Come out and live in the graveyard. Dangle that before her.\r\nIt might thrill her first. Courting death. Shades of night hovering\r\nhere with all the dead stretched about. The shadows of the tombs when\r\nchurchyards yawn and Daniel O\xe2\x80\x99Connell must be a descendant I suppose\r\nwho is this used to say he was a queer breedy man great catholic all the\r\nsame like a big giant in the dark. Will o\xe2\x80\x99 the wisp. Gas of graves.\r\nWant to keep her mind off it to conceive at all. Women especially are so\r\ntouchy. Tell her a ghost story in bed to make her sleep. Have you ever\r\nseen a ghost? Well, I have. It was a pitchdark night. The clock was on\r\nthe stroke of twelve. Still they\xe2\x80\x99d kiss all right if properly keyed up.\r\nWhores in Turkish graveyards. Learn anything if taken young. You might\r\npick up a young widow here. Men like that. Love among the tombstones.\r\nRomeo. Spice of pleasure. In the midst of death we are in life. Both\r\nends meet. Tantalising for the poor dead. Smell of grilled beefsteaks to\r\nthe starving. Gnawing their vitals. Desire to grig people. Molly wanting\r\nto do it at the window. Eight children he has anyway.\r\n\r\nHe has seen a fair share go under in his time, lying around him field\r\nafter field. Holy fields. More room if they buried them standing.\r\nSitting or kneeling you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t. Standing? His head might come up some\r\nday above ground in a landslip with his hand pointing. All honeycombed\r\nthe ground must be: oblong cells. And very neat he keeps it too: trim\r\ngrass and edgings. His garden Major Gamble calls Mount Jerome. Well,\r\nso it is. Ought to be flowers of sleep. Chinese cemeteries with giant\r\npoppies growing produce the best opium Mastiansky told me. The Botanic\r\nGardens are just over there. It\xe2\x80\x99s the blood sinking in the earth gives\r\nnew life. Same idea those jews they said killed the christian boy. Every\r\nman his price. Well preserved fat corpse, gentleman, epicure, invaluable\r\nfor fruit garden. A bargain. By carcass of William Wilkinson, auditor\r\nand accountant, lately deceased, three pounds thirteen and six. With\r\nthanks.\r\n\r\nI daresay the soil would be quite fat with corpsemanure, bones, flesh,\r\nnails. Charnelhouses. Dreadful. Turning green and pink decomposing. Rot\r\nquick in damp earth. The lean old ones tougher. Then a kind of a tallowy\r\nkind of a cheesy. Then begin to get black, black treacle oozing out of\r\nthem. Then dried up. Deathmoths. Of course the cells or whatever they\r\nare go on living. Changing about. Live for ever practically. Nothing to\r\nfeed on feed on themselves.\r\n\r\nBut they must breed a devil of a lot of maggots. Soil must be simply\r\nswirling with them. Your head it simply swurls. Those pretty little\r\nseaside gurls. He looks cheerful enough over it. Gives him a sense of\r\npower seeing all the others go under first. Wonder how he looks at life.\r\nCracking his jokes too: warms the cockles of his heart. The one about\r\nthe bulletin. Spurgeon went to heaven 4 a.m. this morning. 11 p.m.\r\n(closing time). Not arrived yet. Peter. The dead themselves the men\r\nanyhow would like to hear an odd joke or the women to know what\xe2\x80\x99s in\r\nfashion. A juicy pear or ladies\xe2\x80\x99 punch, hot, strong and sweet. Keep\r\nout the damp. You must laugh sometimes so better do it that way.\r\nGravediggers in Hamlet. Shows the profound knowledge of the human heart.\r\nDaren\xe2\x80\x99t joke about the dead for two years at least. De mortuis nil nisi\r\nprius. Go out of mourning first. Hard to imagine his funeral. Seems a\r\nsort of a joke. Read your own obituary notice they say you live longer.\r\nGives you second wind. New lease of life.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94How many have you for tomorrow? the caretaker asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Two, Corny Kelleher said. Half ten and eleven.\r\n\r\nThe caretaker put the papers in his pocket. The barrow had ceased to\r\ntrundle. The mourners split and moved to each side of the hole, stepping\r\nwith care round the graves. The gravediggers bore the coffin and set its\r\nnose on the brink, looping the bands round it.\r\n\r\nBurying him. We come to bury C\xc3\xa6sar. His ides of March or June. He\r\ndoesn\xe2\x80\x99t know who is here nor care. Now who is that lankylooking galoot\r\nover there in the macintosh? Now who is he I\xe2\x80\x99d like to know? Now I\xe2\x80\x99d\r\ngive a trifle to know who he is. Always someone turns up you never\r\ndreamt of. A fellow could live on his lonesome all his life. Yes, he\r\ncould. Still he\xe2\x80\x99d have to get someone to sod him after he died though he\r\ncould dig his own grave. We all do. Only man buries. No, ants too. First\r\nthing strikes anybody. Bury the dead. Say Robinson Crusoe was true to\r\nlife. Well then Friday buried him. Every Friday buries a Thursday if you\r\ncome to look at it.\r\n\r\n     O, poor Robinson Crusoe!\r\n     How could you possibly do so?\r\n\r\nPoor Dignam! His last lie on the earth in his box. When you think of\r\nthem all it does seem a waste of wood. All gnawed through. They could\r\ninvent a handsome bier with a kind of panel sliding, let it down that\r\nway. Ay but they might object to be buried out of another fellow\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\nThey\xe2\x80\x99re so particular. Lay me in my native earth. Bit of clay from\r\nthe holy land. Only a mother and deadborn child ever buried in the one\r\ncoffin. I see what it means. I see. To protect him as long as possible\r\neven in the earth. The Irishman\xe2\x80\x99s house is his coffin. Embalming in\r\ncatacombs, mummies the same idea.\r\n\r\nMr Bloom stood far back, his hat in his hand, counting the bared heads.\r\nTwelve. I\xe2\x80\x99m thirteen. No. The chap in the macintosh is thirteen. Death\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nnumber. Where the deuce did he pop out of? He wasn\xe2\x80\x99t in the chapel, that\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll swear. Silly superstition that about thirteen.\r\n\r\nNice soft tweed Ned Lambert has in that suit. Tinge of purple. I had\r\none like that when we lived in Lombard street west. Dressy fellow he was\r\nonce. Used to change three suits in the day. Must get that grey suit\r\nof mine turned by Mesias. Hello. It\xe2\x80\x99s dyed. His wife I forgot he\xe2\x80\x99s not\r\nmarried or his landlady ought to have picked out those threads for him.\r\n\r\nThe coffin dived out of sight, eased down by the men straddled on the\r\ngravetrestles. They struggled up and out: and all uncovered. Twenty.\r\n\r\nPause.\r\n\r\nIf we were all suddenly somebody else.\r\n\r\nFar away a donkey brayed. Rain. No such ass. Never see a dead one, they\r\nsay. Shame of death. They hide. Also poor papa went away.\r\n\r\nGentle sweet air blew round the bared heads in a whisper. Whisper. The\r\nboy by the gravehead held his wreath with both hands staring quietly in\r\nthe black open space. Mr Bloom moved behind the portly kindly caretaker.\r\nWellcut frockcoat. Weighing them up perhaps to see which will go next.\r\nWell, it is a long rest. Feel no more. It\xe2\x80\x99s the moment you feel. Must be\r\ndamned unpleasant. Can\xe2\x80\x99t believe it at first. Mistake must be: someone\r\nelse. Try the house opposite. Wait, I wanted to. I haven\xe2\x80\x99t yet. Then\r\ndarkened deathchamber. Light they want. Whispering around you. Would you\r\nlike to see a priest? Then rambling and wandering. Delirium all you hid\r\nall your life. The death struggle. His sleep is not natural. Press his\r\nlower eyelid. Watching is his nose pointed is his jaw sinking are the\r\nsoles of his feet yellow. Pull the pillow away and finish it off on the\r\nfloor since he\xe2\x80\x99s doomed. Devil in that picture of sinner\xe2\x80\x99s death showing\r\nhim a woman. Dying to embrace her in his shirt. Last act of Lucia. Shall\r\nI nevermore behold thee? Bam! He expires. Gone at last. People talk\r\nabout you a bit: forget you. Don\xe2\x80\x99t forget to pray for him. Remember\r\nhim in your prayers. Even Parnell. Ivy day dying out. Then they follow:\r\ndropping into a hole, one after the other.\r\n\r\nWe are praying now for the repose of his soul. Hoping you\xe2\x80\x99re well and\r\nnot in hell. Nice change of air. Out of the fryingpan of life into the\r\nfire of purgatory.\r\n\r\nDoes he ever think of the hole waiting for himself? They say you do when\r\nyou shiver in the sun. Someone walking over it. Callboy\xe2\x80\x99s warning. Near\r\nyou. Mine over there towards Finglas, the plot I bought. Mamma, poor\r\nmamma, and little Rudy.\r\n\r\nThe gravediggers took up their spades and flung heavy clods of clay in\r\non the coffin. Mr Bloom turned away his face. And if he was alive all\r\nthe time? Whew! By jingo, that would be awful! No, no: he is dead, of\r\ncourse. Of course he is dead. Monday he died. They ought to have\r\nsome law to pierce the heart and make sure or an electric clock or\r\na telephone in the coffin and some kind of a canvas airhole. Flag of\r\ndistress. Three days. Rather long to keep them in summer. Just as well\r\nto get shut of them as soon as you are sure there\xe2\x80\x99s no.\r\n\r\nThe clay fell softer. Begin to be forgotten. Out of sight, out of mind.\r\n\r\nThe caretaker moved away a few paces and put on his hat. Had enough of\r\nit. The mourners took heart of grace, one by one, covering themselves\r\nwithout show. Mr Bloom put on his hat and saw the portly figure make its\r\nway deftly through the maze of graves. Quietly, sure of his ground, he\r\ntraversed the dismal fields.\r\n\r\nHynes jotting down something in his notebook. Ah, the names. But he\r\nknows them all. No: coming to me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I am just taking the names, Hynes said below his breath. What is your\r\nchristian name? I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94L, Mr Bloom said. Leopold. And you might put down M\xe2\x80\x99Coy\xe2\x80\x99s name too. He\r\nasked me to.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Charley, Hynes said writing. I know. He was on the Freeman once.\r\n\r\nSo he was before he got the job in the morgue under Louis Byrne. Good\r\nidea a postmortem for doctors. Find out what they imagine they know.\r\nHe died of a Tuesday. Got the run. Levanted with the cash of a few ads.\r\nCharley, you\xe2\x80\x99re my darling. That was why he asked me to. O well, does\r\nno harm. I saw to that, M\xe2\x80\x99Coy. Thanks, old chap: much obliged. Leave him\r\nunder an obligation: costs nothing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94And tell us, Hynes said, do you know that fellow in the, fellow was\r\nover there in the...\r\n\r\nHe looked around.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Macintosh. Yes, I saw him, Mr Bloom said. Where is he now?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94M\xe2\x80\x99Intosh, Hynes said scribbling. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know who he is. Is that his\r\nname?\r\n\r\nHe moved away, looking about him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94No, Mr Bloom began, turning and stopping. I say, Hynes!\r\n\r\nDidn\xe2\x80\x99t hear. What? Where has he disappeared to? Not a sign. Well of all\r\nthe. Has anybody here seen? Kay ee double ell. Become invisible. Good\r\nLord, what became of him?\r\n\r\nA seventh gravedigger came beside Mr Bloom to take up an idle spade.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94O, excuse me!\r\n\r\nHe stepped aside nimbly.\r\n\r\nClay, brown, damp, began to be seen in the hole. It rose. Nearly over.\r\nA mound of damp clods rose more, rose, and the gravediggers rested their\r\nspades. All uncovered again for a few instants. The boy propped\r\nhis wreath against a corner: the brother-in-law his on a lump. The\r\ngravediggers put on their caps and carried their earthy spades towards\r\nthe barrow. Then knocked the blades lightly on the turf: clean. One bent\r\nto pluck from the haft a long tuft of grass. One, leaving his mates,\r\nwalked slowly on with shouldered weapon, its blade blueglancing.\r\nSilently at the gravehead another coiled the coffinband. His navelcord.\r\nThe brother-in-law, turning away, placed something in his free hand.\r\nThanks in silence. Sorry, sir: trouble. Headshake. I know that. For\r\nyourselves just.\r\n\r\nThe mourners moved away slowly without aim, by devious paths, staying at\r\nwhiles to read a name on a tomb.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Let us go round by the chief\xe2\x80\x99s grave, Hynes said. We have time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Let us, Mr Power said.\r\n\r\nThey turned to the right, following their slow thoughts. With awe Mr\r\nPower\xe2\x80\x99s blank voice spoke:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Some say he is not in that grave at all. That the coffin was filled\r\nwith stones. That one day he will come again.\r\n\r\nHynes shook his head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Parnell will never come again, he said. He\xe2\x80\x99s there, all that was mortal\r\nof him. Peace to his ashes.\r\n\r\nMr Bloom walked unheeded along his grove by saddened angels, crosses,\r\nbroken pillars, family vaults, stone hopes praying with upcast eyes,\r\nold Ireland\xe2\x80\x99s hearts and hands. More sensible to spend the money on some\r\ncharity for the living. Pray for the repose of the soul of. Does anybody\r\nreally? Plant him and have done with him. Like down a coalshoot. Then\r\nlump them together to save time. All souls\xe2\x80\x99 day. Twentyseventh I\xe2\x80\x99ll be\r\nat his grave. Ten shillings for the gardener. He keeps it free of weeds.\r\nOld man himself. Bent down double with his shears clipping. Near death\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndoor. Who passed away. Who departed this life. As if they did it of\r\ntheir own accord. Got the shove, all of them. Who kicked the\r\nbucket. More interesting if they told you what they were. So and So,\r\nwheelwright. I travelled for cork lino. I paid five shillings in the\r\npound. Or a woman\xe2\x80\x99s with her saucepan. I cooked good Irish stew.\r\nEulogy in a country churchyard it ought to be that poem of whose is it\r\nWordsworth or Thomas Campbell. Entered into rest the protestants put it.\r\nOld Dr Murren\xe2\x80\x99s. The great physician called him home. Well it\xe2\x80\x99s God\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nacre for them. Nice country residence. Newly plastered and painted.\r\nIdeal spot to have a quiet smoke and read the Church Times. Marriage\r\nads they never try to beautify. Rusty wreaths hung on knobs, garlands of\r\nbronzefoil. Better value that for the money. Still, the flowers are more\r\npoetical. The other gets rather tiresome, never withering. Expresses\r\nnothing. Immortelles.\r\n\r\nA bird sat tamely perched on a poplar branch. Like stuffed. Like the\r\nwedding present alderman Hooper gave us. Hoo! Not a budge out of him.\r\nKnows there are no catapults to let fly at him. Dead animal even sadder.\r\nSilly-Milly burying the little dead bird in the kitchen matchbox, a\r\ndaisychain and bits of broken chainies on the grave.\r\n\r\nThe Sacred Heart that is: showing it. Heart on his sleeve. Ought to be\r\nsideways and red it should be painted like a real heart. Ireland was\r\ndedicated to it or whatever that. Seems anything but pleased. Why this\r\ninfliction? Would birds come then and peck like the boy with the basket\r\nof fruit but he said no because they ought to have been afraid of the\r\nboy. Apollo that was.\r\n\r\nHow many! All these here once walked round Dublin. Faithful departed. As\r\nyou are now so once were we.\r\n\r\nBesides how could you remember everybody? Eyes, walk, voice. Well, the\r\nvoice, yes: gramophone. Have a gramophone in every grave or keep it in\r\nthe house. After dinner on a Sunday. Put on poor old greatgrandfather.\r\nKraahraark! Hellohellohello amawfullyglad kraark awfullygladaseeagain\r\nhellohello amawf krpthsth. Remind you of the voice like the photograph\r\nreminds you of the face. Otherwise you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t remember the face after\r\nfifteen years, say. For instance who? For instance some fellow that died\r\nwhen I was in Wisdom Hely\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\nRtststr! A rattle of pebbles. Wait. Stop!\r\n\r\nHe looked down intently into a stone crypt. Some animal. Wait. There he\r\ngoes.\r\n\r\nAn obese grey rat toddled along the side of the crypt, moving the\r\npebbles. An old stager: greatgrandfather: he knows the ropes. The grey\r\nalive crushed itself in under the plinth, wriggled itself in under it.\r\nGood hidingplace for treasure.\r\n\r\nWho lives there? Are laid the remains of Robert Emery. Robert Emmet was\r\nburied here by torchlight, wasn\xe2\x80\x99t he? Making his rounds.\r\n\r\nTail gone now.\r\n\r\nOne of those chaps would make short work of a fellow. Pick the bones\r\nclean no matter who it was. Ordinary meat for them. A corpse is meat\r\ngone bad. Well and what\xe2\x80\x99s cheese? Corpse of milk. I read in that\r\nVoyages in China that the Chinese say a white man smells like a corpse.\r\nCremation better. Priests dead against it. Devilling for the other firm.\r\nWholesale burners and Dutch oven dealers. Time of the plague. Quicklime\r\nfeverpits to eat them. Lethal chamber. Ashes to ashes. Or bury at sea.\r\nWhere is that Parsee tower of silence? Eaten by birds. Earth, fire,\r\nwater. Drowning they say is the pleasantest. See your whole life in a\r\nflash. But being brought back to life no. Can\xe2\x80\x99t bury in the air however.\r\nOut of a flying machine. Wonder does the news go about whenever a fresh\r\none is let down. Underground communication. We learned that from them.\r\nWouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be surprised. Regular square feed for them. Flies come before\r\nhe\xe2\x80\x99s well dead. Got wind of Dignam. They wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t care about the smell\r\nof it. Saltwhite crumbling mush of corpse: smell, taste like raw white\r\nturnips.\r\n\r\nThe gates glimmered in front: still open. Back to the world again.\r\nEnough of this place. Brings you a bit nearer every time. Last time I\r\nwas here was Mrs Sinico\xe2\x80\x99s funeral. Poor papa too. The love that kills.\r\nAnd even scraping up the earth at night with a lantern like that case\r\nI read of to get at fresh buried females or even putrefied with running\r\ngravesores. Give you the creeps after a bit. I will appear to you after\r\ndeath. You will see my ghost after death. My ghost will haunt you after\r\ndeath. There is another world after death named hell. I do not like that\r\nother world she wrote. No more do I. Plenty to see and hear and feel\r\nyet. Feel live warm beings near you. Let them sleep in their maggoty\r\nbeds. They are not going to get me this innings. Warm beds: warm\r\nfullblooded life.\r\n\r\nMartin Cunningham emerged from a sidepath, talking gravely.\r\n\r\nSolicitor, I think. I know his face. Menton, John Henry, solicitor,\r\ncommissioner for oaths and affidavits. Dignam used to be in his office.\r\nMat Dillon\xe2\x80\x99s long ago. Jolly Mat. Convivial evenings. Cold fowl, cigars,\r\nthe Tantalus glasses. Heart of gold really. Yes, Menton. Got his rag out\r\nthat evening on the bowlinggreen because I sailed inside him. Pure fluke\r\nof mine: the bias. Why he took such a rooted dislike to me. Hate\r\nat first sight. Molly and Floey Dillon linked under the lilactree,\r\nlaughing. Fellow always like that, mortified if women are by.\r\n\r\nGot a dinge in the side of his hat. Carriage probably.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Excuse me, sir, Mr Bloom said beside them.\r\n\r\nThey stopped.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Your hat is a little crushed, Mr Bloom said pointing.\r\n\r\nJohn Henry Menton stared at him for an instant without moving.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94There, Martin Cunningham helped, pointing also.\r\n\r\nJohn Henry Menton took off his hat, bulged out the dinge and smoothed\r\nthe nap with care on his coatsleeve. He clapped the hat on his head\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94It\xe2\x80\x99s all right now, Martin Cunningham said.\r\n\r\nJohn Henry Menton jerked his head down in acknowledgment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Thank you, he said shortly.\r\n\r\nThey walked on towards the gates. Mr Bloom, chapfallen, drew behind\r\na few paces so as not to overhear. Martin laying down the law. Martin\r\ncould wind a sappyhead like that round his little finger, without his\r\nseeing it.\r\n\r\nOyster eyes. Never mind. Be sorry after perhaps when it dawns on him.\r\nGet the pull over him that way.\r\n\r\nThank you. How grand we are this morning!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[ 7 ] IN THE HEART OF THE HIBERNIAN METROPOLIS\r\n\r\nBefore Nelson\xe2\x80\x99s pillar trams slowed, shunted, changed trolley, started\r\nfor Blackrock, Kingstown and Dalkey, Clonskea, Rathgar and Terenure,\r\nPalmerston Park and upper Rathmines, Sandymount Green, Rathmines,\r\nRingsend and Sandymount Tower, Harold\xe2\x80\x99s Cross. The hoarse Dublin United\r\nTramway Company\xe2\x80\x99s timekeeper bawled them off:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Rathgar and Terenure!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Come on, Sandymount Green!\r\n\r\nRight and left parallel clanging ringing a doubledecker and a singledeck\r\nmoved from their railheads, swerved to the down line, glided parallel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Start, Palmerston Park! THE WEARER OF THE CROWN\r\n\r\nUnder the porch of the general post office shoeblacks called and\r\npolished. Parked in North Prince\xe2\x80\x99s street His Majesty\xe2\x80\x99s vermilion\r\nmailcars, bearing on their sides the royal initials, E. R., received\r\nloudly flung sacks of letters, postcards, lettercards, parcels,\r\ninsured and paid, for local, provincial, British and overseas delivery.\r\nGENTLEMEN OF THE PRESS\r\n\r\nGrossbooted draymen rolled barrels dullthudding out of Prince\xe2\x80\x99s stores\r\nand bumped them up on the brewery float. On the brewery float bumped\r\ndullthudding barrels rolled by grossbooted draymen out of Prince\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nstores.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94There it is, Red Murray said. Alexander Keyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Just cut it out, will you? Mr Bloom said, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll take it round to the\r\nTelegraph office.\r\n\r\nThe door of Ruttledge\xe2\x80\x99s office creaked again. Davy Stephens, minute in a\r\nlarge capecoat, a small felt hat crowning his ringlets, passed out with\r\na roll of papers under his cape, a king\xe2\x80\x99s courier.\r\n\r\nRed Murray\xe2\x80\x99s long shears sliced out the advertisement from the newspaper\r\nin four clean strokes. Scissors and paste.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ll go through the printingworks, Mr Bloom said, taking the cut\r\nsquare.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Of course, if he wants a par, Red Murray said earnestly, a pen behind\r\nhis ear, we can do him one.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Right, Mr Bloom said with a nod. I\xe2\x80\x99ll rub that in.\r\n\r\nWe. WILLIAM BRAYDEN, ESQUIRE, OF OAKLANDS, SANDYMOUNT\r\n\r\nRed Murray touched Mr Bloom\xe2\x80\x99s arm with the shears and whispered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Brayden.\r\n\r\nMr Bloom turned and saw the liveried porter raise his lettered cap as a\r\nstately figure entered between the newsboards of the Weekly Freeman\r\nand National Press and the Freeman\xe2\x80\x99s Journal and National Press.\r\nDullthudding Guinness\xe2\x80\x99s barrels. It passed statelily up the staircase,\r\nsteered by an umbrella, a solemn beardframed face. The broadcloth back\r\nascended each step: back. All his brains are in the nape of his neck,\r\nSimon Dedalus says. Welts of flesh behind on him. Fat folds of neck,\r\nfat, neck, fat, neck.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Don\xe2\x80\x99t you think his face is like Our Saviour? Red Murray whispered.\r\n\r\nThe door of Ruttledge\xe2\x80\x99s office whispered: ee: cree. They always build\r\none door opposite another for the wind to. Way in. Way out.\r\n\r\nOur Saviour: beardframed oval face: talking in the dusk. Mary, Martha.\r\nSteered by an umbrella sword to the footlights: Mario the tenor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Or like Mario, Mr Bloom said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Yes, Red Murray agreed. But Mario was said to be the picture of Our\r\nSaviour.\r\n\r\nJesusmario with rougy cheeks, doublet and spindle legs. Hand on his\r\nheart. In Martha.\r\n\r\n     Co-ome thou lost one,\r\n     Co-ome thou dear one!\r\n\r\nTHE CROZIER AND THE PEN\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94His grace phoned down twice this morning, Red Murray said gravely.\r\n\r\nThey watched the knees, legs, boots vanish. Neck.\r\n\r\nA telegram boy stepped in nimbly, threw an envelope on the counter and\r\nstepped off posthaste with a word:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Freeman!\r\n\r\nMr Bloom said slowly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Well, he is one of our saviours also.\r\n\r\nA meek smile accompanied him as he lifted the counterflap, as he passed\r\nin through a sidedoor and along the warm dark stairs and passage,\r\nalong the now reverberating boards. But will he save the circulation?\r\nThumping. Thumping.\r\n\r\nHe pushed in the glass swingdoor and entered, stepping over strewn\r\npacking paper. Through a lane of clanking drums he made his way towards\r\nNannetti\xe2\x80\x99s reading closet. WITH UNFEIGNED REGRET IT IS WE ANNOUNCE THE\r\nDISSOLUTION OF A MOST RESPECTED DUBLIN BURGESS\r\n\r\nHynes here too: account of the funeral probably. Thumping. Thump. This\r\nmorning the remains of the late Mr Patrick Dignam. Machines. Smash a man\r\nto atoms if they got him caught. Rule the world today. His machineries\r\nare pegging away too. Like these, got out of hand: fermenting. Working\r\naway, tearing away. And that old grey rat tearing to get in. HOW A GREAT\r\nDAILY ORGAN IS TURNED OUT\r\n\r\nMr Bloom halted behind the foreman\xe2\x80\x99s spare body, admiring a glossy\r\ncrown.\r\n\r\nStrange he never saw his real country. Ireland my country. Member for\r\nCollege green. He boomed that workaday worker tack for all it was worth.\r\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s the ads and side features sell a weekly, not the stale news in the\r\nofficial gazette. Queen Anne is dead. Published by authority in the year\r\none thousand and. Demesne situate in the townland of Rosenallis, barony\r\nof Tinnahinch. To all whom it may concern schedule pursuant to statute\r\nshowing return of number of mules and jennets exported from Ballina.\r\nNature notes. Cartoons. Phil Blake\xe2\x80\x99s weekly Pat and Bull story. Uncle\r\nToby\xe2\x80\x99s page for tiny tots. Country bumpkin\xe2\x80\x99s queries. Dear Mr Editor,\r\nwhat is a good cure for flatulence? I\xe2\x80\x99d like that part. Learn a lot\r\nteaching others. The personal note. M. A. P. Mainly all pictures.\r\nShapely bathers on golden strand. World\xe2\x80\x99s biggest balloon. Double\r\nmarriage of sisters celebrated. Two bridegrooms laughing heartily at\r\neach other. Cuprani too, printer. More Irish than the Irish.\r\n\r\nThe machines clanked in threefour time. Thump, thump, thump. Now if he\r\ngot paralysed there and no-one knew how to stop them they\xe2\x80\x99d clank on and\r\non the same, print it over and over and up and back. Monkeydoodle the\r\nwhole thing. Want a cool head.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Well, get it into the evening edition, councillor, Hynes said.\r\n\r\nSoon be calling him my lord mayor. Long John is backing him, they say.\r\n\r\nThe foreman, without answering, scribbled press on a corner of the sheet\r\nand made a sign to a typesetter. He handed the sheet silently over the\r\ndirty glass screen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Right: thanks, Hynes said moving off.\r\n\r\nMr Bloom stood in his way.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94If you want to draw the cashier is just going to lunch, he said,\r\npointing backward with his thumb.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Did you? Hynes asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Mm, Mr Bloom said. Look sharp and you\xe2\x80\x99ll catch him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Thanks, old man, Hynes said. I\xe2\x80\x99ll tap him too.\r\n\r\nHe hurried on eagerly towards the Freeman\xe2\x80\x99s Journal.\r\n\r\nThree bob I lent him in Meagher\xe2\x80\x99s. Three weeks. Third hint. WE SEE THE\r\nCANVASSER AT WORK\r\n\r\nMr Bloom laid his cutting on Mr Nannetti\xe2\x80\x99s desk.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Excuse me, councillor, he said. This ad, you see. Keyes, you remember?\r\n\r\nMr Nannetti considered the cutting awhile and nodded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94He wants it in for July, Mr Bloom said.\r\n\r\nThe foreman moved his pencil towards it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94But wait, Mr Bloom said. He wants it changed. Keyes, you see. He wants\r\ntwo keys at the top.\r\n\r\nHell of a racket they make. He doesn\xe2\x80\x99t hear it. Nannan. Iron nerves.\r\nMaybe he understands what I.\r\n\r\nThe foreman turned round to hear patiently and, lifting an elbow, began\r\nto scratch slowly in the armpit of his alpaca jacket.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Like that, Mr Bloom said, crossing his forefingers at the top.\r\n\r\nLet him take that in first.\r\n\r\nMr Bloom, glancing sideways up from the cross he had made, saw the\r\nforeman\xe2\x80\x99s sallow face, think he has a touch of jaundice, and beyond the\r\nobedient reels feeding in huge webs of paper. Clank it. Clank it. Miles\r\nof it unreeled. What becomes of it after? O, wrap up meat, parcels:\r\nvarious uses, thousand and one things.\r\n\r\nSlipping his words deftly into the pauses of the clanking he drew\r\nswiftly on the scarred woodwork. HOUSE OF KEY(E)S\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Like that, see. Two crossed keys here. A circle. Then here the name.\r\nAlexander Keyes, tea, wine and spirit merchant. So on.\r\n\r\nBetter not teach him his own business.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94You know yourself, councillor, just what he wants. Then round the top\r\nin leaded: the house of keys. You see? Do you think that\xe2\x80\x99s a good idea?\r\n\r\nThe foreman moved his scratching hand to his lower ribs and scratched\r\nthere quietly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94The idea, Mr Bloom said, is the house of keys. You know, councillor,\r\nthe Manx parliament. Innuendo of home rule. Tourists, you know, from the\r\nisle of Man. Catches the eye, you see. Can you do that?\r\n\r\nI could ask him perhaps about how to pronounce that voglio. But then if\r\nhe didn\xe2\x80\x99t know only make it awkward for him. Better not.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94We can do that, the foreman said. Have you the design?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I can get it, Mr Bloom said. It was in a Kilkenny paper. He has a house\r\nthere too. I\xe2\x80\x99ll just run out and ask him. Well, you can do that and just\r\na little par calling attention. You know the usual. Highclass licensed\r\npremises. Longfelt want. So on.\r\n\r\nThe foreman thought for an instant.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94We can do that, he said. Let him give us a three months\xe2\x80\x99 renewal.\r\n\r\nA typesetter brought him a limp galleypage. He began to check it\r\nsilently. Mr Bloom stood by, hearing the loud throbs of cranks, watching\r\nthe silent typesetters at their cases. ORTHOGRAPHICAL\r\n\r\nWant to be sure of his spelling. Proof fever. Martin Cunningham forgot\r\nto give us his spellingbee conundrum this morning. It is amusing to view\r\nthe unpar one ar alleled embarra two ars is it? double ess ment of a\r\nharassed pedlar while gauging au the symmetry with a y of a peeled pear\r\nunder a cemetery wall. Silly, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it? Cemetery put in of course on\r\naccount of the symmetry.\r\n\r\nI should have said when he clapped on his topper. Thank you. I ought\r\nto have said something about an old hat or something. No. I could have\r\nsaid. Looks as good as new now. See his phiz then.\r\n\r\nSllt. The nethermost deck of the first machine jogged forward its\r\nflyboard with sllt the first batch of quirefolded papers. Sllt. Almost\r\nhuman the way it sllt to call attention. Doing its level best to speak.\r\nThat door too sllt creaking, asking to be shut. Everything speaks in its\r\nown way. Sllt. NOTED CHURCHMAN AN OCCASIONAL CONTRIBUTOR\r\n\r\nThe foreman handed back the galleypage suddenly, saying:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Wait. Where\xe2\x80\x99s the archbishop\xe2\x80\x99s letter? It\xe2\x80\x99s to be repeated in the\r\nTelegraph. Where\xe2\x80\x99s what\xe2\x80\x99s his name?\r\n\r\nHe looked about him round his loud unanswering machines.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Monks, sir? a voice asked from the castingbox.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Ay. Where\xe2\x80\x99s Monks?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Monks!\r\n\r\nMr Bloom took up his cutting. Time to get out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Then I\xe2\x80\x99ll get the design, Mr Nannetti, he said, and you\xe2\x80\x99ll give it a\r\ngood place I know.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Monks!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nThree months\xe2\x80\x99 renewal. Want to get some wind off my chest first. Try it\r\nanyhow. Rub in August: good idea: horseshow month. Ballsbridge. Tourists\r\nover for the show. A DAYFATHER\r\n\r\nHe walked on through the caseroom passing an old man, bowed, spectacled,\r\naproned. Old Monks, the dayfather. Queer lot of stuff he must have put\r\nthrough his hands in his time: obituary notices, pubs\xe2\x80\x99 ads, speeches,\r\ndivorce suits, found drowned. Nearing the end of his tether now. Sober\r\nserious man with a bit in the savingsbank I\xe2\x80\x99d say. Wife a good cook and\r\nwasher. Daughter working the machine in the parlour. Plain Jane, no damn\r\nnonsense. AND IT WAS THE FEAST OF THE PASSOVER\r\n\r\nHe stayed in his walk to watch a typesetter neatly distributing type.\r\nReads it backwards first. Quickly he does it. Must require some practice\r\nthat. mangiD kcirtaP. Poor papa with his hagadah book, reading backwards\r\nwith his finger to me. Pessach. Next year in Jerusalem. Dear, O dear!\r\nAll that long business about that brought us out of the land of Egypt\r\nand into the house of bondage alleluia. Shema Israel Adonai Elohenu. No,\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s the other. Then the twelve brothers, Jacob\xe2\x80\x99s sons. And then\r\nthe lamb and the cat and the dog and the stick and the water and the\r\nbutcher. And then the angel of death kills the butcher and he kills the\r\nox and the dog kills the cat. Sounds a bit silly till you come to look\r\ninto it well. Justice it means but it\xe2\x80\x99s everybody eating everyone else.\r\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s what life is after all. How quickly he does that job. Practice\r\nmakes perfect. Seems to see with his fingers.\r\n\r\nMr Bloom passed on out of the clanking noises through the gallery on to\r\nthe landing. Now am I going to tram it out all the way and then catch\r\nhim out perhaps. Better phone him up first. Number? Yes. Same as\r\nCitron\xe2\x80\x99s house. Twentyeight. Twentyeight double four. ONLY ONCE MORE\r\nTHAT SOAP\r\n\r\nHe went down the house staircase. Who the deuce scrawled all over those\r\nwalls with matches? Looks as if they did it for a bet. Heavy greasy\r\nsmell there always is in those works. Lukewarm glue in Thom\xe2\x80\x99s next door\r\nwhen I was there.\r\n\r\nHe took out his handkerchief to dab his nose. Citronlemon? Ah, the soap\r\nI put there. Lose it out of that pocket. Putting back his handkerchief\r\nhe took out the soap and stowed it away, buttoned, into the hip pocket\r\nof his trousers.\r\n\r\nWhat perfume does your wife use? I could go home still: tram: something\r\nI forgot. Just to see: before: dressing. No. Here. No.\r\n\r\nA sudden screech of laughter came from the Evening Telegraph office.\r\nKnow who that is. What\xe2\x80\x99s up? Pop in a minute to phone. Ned Lambert it\r\nis.\r\n\r\nHe entered softly. ERIN, GREEN GEM OF THE SILVER SEA\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94The ghost walks, professor MacHugh murmured softly, biscuitfully to the\r\ndusty windowpane.\r\n\r\nMr Dedalus, staring from the empty fireplace at Ned Lambert\xe2\x80\x99s quizzing\r\nface, asked of it sourly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Agonising Christ, wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t it give you a heartburn on your arse?\r\n\r\nNed Lambert, seated on the table, read on:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Or again, note the meanderings of some purling rill as it babbles on\r\nits way, tho\xe2\x80\x99 quarrelling with the stony obstacles, to the tumbling\r\nwaters of Neptune\xe2\x80\x99s blue domain, \xe2\x80\x98mid mossy banks, fanned by gentlest\r\nzephyrs, played on by the glorious sunlight or \xe2\x80\x98neath the shadows cast\r\no\xe2\x80\x99er its pensive bosom by the overarching leafage of the giants of\r\nthe forest. What about that, Simon? he asked over the fringe of his\r\nnewspaper. How\xe2\x80\x99s that for high?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Changing his drink, Mr Dedalus said.\r\n\r\nNed Lambert, laughing, struck the newspaper on his knees, repeating:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94The pensive bosom and the overarsing leafage. O boys! O boys!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94And Xenophon looked upon Marathon, Mr Dedalus said, looking again on\r\nthe fireplace and to the window, and Marathon looked on the sea.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94That will do, professor MacHugh cried from the window. I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to\r\nhear any more of the stuff.\r\n\r\nHe ate off the crescent of water biscuit he had been nibbling and,\r\nhungered, made ready to nibble the biscuit in his other hand.\r\n\r\nHigh falutin stuff. Bladderbags. Ned Lambert is taking a day off I see.\r\nRather upsets a man\xe2\x80\x99s day, a funeral does. He has influence they\r\nsay. Old Chatterton, the vicechancellor, is his granduncle or his\r\ngreatgranduncle. Close on ninety they say. Subleader for his death\r\nwritten this long time perhaps. Living to spite them. Might go first\r\nhimself. Johnny, make room for your uncle. The right honourable Hedges\r\nEyre Chatterton. Daresay he writes him an odd shaky cheque or two on\r\ngale days. Windfall when he kicks out. Alleluia.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Just another spasm, Ned Lambert said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94What is it? Mr Bloom asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94A recently discovered fragment of Cicero, professor MacHugh answered\r\nwith pomp of tone. Our lovely land. SHORT BUT TO THE POINT\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Whose land? Mr Bloom said simply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Most pertinent question, the professor said between his chews. With an\r\naccent on the whose.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Dan Dawson\xe2\x80\x99s land Mr Dedalus said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Is it his speech last night? Mr Bloom asked.\r\n\r\nNed Lambert nodded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94But listen to this, he said.\r\n\r\nThe doorknob hit Mr Bloom in the small of the back as the door was\r\npushed in.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Excuse me, J. J. O\xe2\x80\x99Molloy said, entering.\r\n\r\nMr Bloom moved nimbly aside.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I beg yours, he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Good day, Jack.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Come in. Come in.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Good day.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94How are you, Dedalus?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Well. And yourself?\r\n\r\nJ. J. O\xe2\x80\x99Molloy shook his head. SAD\r\n\r\nCleverest fellow at the junior bar he used to be. Decline, poor chap.\r\nThat hectic flush spells finis for a man. Touch and go with him. What\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nin the wind, I wonder. Money worry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Or again if we but climb the serried mountain peaks.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94You\xe2\x80\x99re looking extra.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Is the editor to be seen? J. J. O\xe2\x80\x99Molloy asked, looking towards the\r\ninner door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Very much so, professor MacHugh said. To be seen and heard. He\xe2\x80\x99s in his\r\nsanctum with Lenehan.\r\n\r\nJ. J. O\xe2\x80\x99Molloy strolled to the sloping desk and began to turn back the\r\npink pages of the file.\r\n\r\nPractice dwindling. A mighthavebeen. Losing heart. Gambling. Debts of\r\nhonour. Reaping the whirlwind. Used to get good retainers from D. and T.\r\nFitzgerald. Their wigs to show the grey matter. Brains on their sleeve\r\nlike the statue in Glasnevin. Believe he does some literary work for the\r\nExpress with Gabriel Conroy. Wellread fellow. Myles Crawford began on\r\nthe Independent. Funny the way those newspaper men veer about when\r\nthey get wind of a new opening. Weathercocks. Hot and cold in the same\r\nbreath. Wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t know which to believe. One story good till you hear\r\nthe next. Go for one another baldheaded in the papers and then all blows\r\nover. Hail fellow well met the next moment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Ah, listen to this for God\xe2\x80\x99 sake, Ned Lambert pleaded. Or again if we\r\nbut climb the serried mountain peaks...\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Bombast! the professor broke in testily. Enough of the inflated\r\nwindbag!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Peaks, Ned Lambert went on, towering high on high, to bathe our souls,\r\nas it were...\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Bathe his lips, Mr Dedalus said. Blessed and eternal God! Yes? Is he\r\ntaking anything for it?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94As \xe2\x80\x98twere, in the peerless panorama of Ireland\xe2\x80\x99s portfolio, unmatched,\r\ndespite their wellpraised prototypes in other vaunted prize regions,\r\nfor very beauty, of bosky grove and undulating plain and luscious\r\npastureland of vernal green, steeped in the transcendent translucent\r\nglow of our mild mysterious Irish twilight... HIS NATIVE DORIC\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94The moon, professor MacHugh said. He forgot Hamlet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94That mantles the vista far and wide and wait till the glowing orb of\r\nthe moon shine forth to irradiate her silver effulgence...\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94O! Mr Dedalus cried, giving vent to a hopeless groan. Shite and onions!\r\nThat\xe2\x80\x99ll do, Ned. Life is too short.\r\n\r\nHe took off his silk hat and, blowing out impatiently his bushy\r\nmoustache, welshcombed his hair with raking fingers.\r\n\r\nNed Lambert tossed the newspaper aside, chuckling with delight. An\r\ninstant after a hoarse bark of laughter burst over professor MacHugh\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nunshaven blackspectacled face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Doughy Daw! he cried. WHAT WETHERUP SAID\r\n\r\nAll very fine to jeer at it now in cold print but it goes down like hot\r\ncake that stuff. He was in the bakery line too, wasn\xe2\x80\x99t he? Why they call\r\nhim Doughy Daw. Feathered his nest well anyhow. Daughter engaged to that\r\nchap in the inland revenue office with the motor. Hooked that nicely.\r\nEntertainments. Open house. Big blowout. Wetherup always said that. Get\r\na grip of them by the stomach.\r\n\r\nThe inner door was opened violently and a scarlet beaked face, crested\r\nby a comb of feathery hair, thrust itself in. The bold blue eyes stared\r\nabout them and the harsh voice asked:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94What is it?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94And here comes the sham squire himself! professor MacHugh said grandly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Getonouthat, you bloody old pedagogue! the editor said in recognition.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Come, Ned, Mr Dedalus said, putting on his hat. I must get a drink\r\nafter that.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Drink! the editor cried. No drinks served before mass.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Quite right too, Mr Dedalus said, going out. Come on, Ned.\r\n\r\nNed Lambert sidled down from the table. The editor\xe2\x80\x99s blue eyes roved\r\ntowards Mr Bloom\xe2\x80\x99s face, shadowed by a smile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Will you join us, Myles? Ned Lambert asked. MEMORABLE BATTLES RECALLED\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94North Cork militia! the editor cried, striding to the mantelpiece. We\r\nwon every time! North Cork and Spanish officers!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Where was that, Myles? Ned Lambert asked with a reflective glance at\r\nhis toecaps.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94In Ohio! the editor shouted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94So it was, begad, Ned Lambert agreed.\r\n\r\nPassing out he whispered to J. J. O\xe2\x80\x99Molloy:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Incipient jigs. Sad case.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Ohio! the editor crowed in high treble from his uplifted scarlet face.\r\nMy Ohio!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94A perfect cretic! the professor said. Long, short and long. O, HARP\r\nEOLIAN!\r\n\r\nHe took a reel of dental floss from his waistcoat pocket and, breaking\r\noff a piece, twanged it smartly between two and two of his resonant\r\nunwashed teeth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Bingbang, bangbang.\r\n\r\nMr Bloom, seeing the coast clear, made for the inner door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Just a moment, Mr Crawford, he said. I just want to phone about an ad.\r\n\r\nHe went in.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94What about that leader this evening? professor MacHugh asked, coming to\r\nthe editor and laying a firm hand on his shoulder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94That\xe2\x80\x99ll be all right, Myles Crawford said more calmly. Never you fret.\r\nHello, Jack. That\xe2\x80\x99s all right.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Good day, Myles, J. J. O\xe2\x80\x99Molloy said, letting the pages he held slip\r\nlimply back on the file. Is that Canada swindle case on today?\r\n\r\nThe telephone whirred inside.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Twentyeight... No, twenty... Double four... Yes. SPOT THE WINNER\r\n\r\nLenehan came out of the inner office with Sport\xe2\x80\x99s tissues.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Who wants a dead cert for the Gold cup? he asked. Sceptre with O.\r\nMadden up.\r\n\r\nHe tossed the tissues on to the table.\r\n\r\nScreams of newsboys barefoot in the hall rushed near and the door was\r\nflung open.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Hush, Lenehan said. I hear feetstoops.\r\n\r\nProfessor MacHugh strode across the room and seized the cringing urchin\r\nby the collar as the others scampered out of the hall and down the\r\nsteps. The tissues rustled up in the draught, floated softly in the air\r\nblue scrawls and under the table came to earth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t me, sir. It was the big fellow shoved me, sir.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Throw him out and shut the door, the editor said. There\xe2\x80\x99s a hurricane\r\nblowing.\r\n\r\nLenehan began to paw the tissues up from the floor, grunting as he\r\nstooped twice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Waiting for the racing special, sir, the newsboy said. It was Pat\r\nFarrell shoved me, sir.\r\n\r\nHe pointed to two faces peering in round the doorframe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Him, sir.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Out of this with you, professor MacHugh said gruffly.\r\n\r\nHe hustled the boy out and banged the door to.\r\n\r\nJ. J. O\xe2\x80\x99Molloy turned the files crackingly over, murmuring, seeking:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Continued on page six, column four.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Yes, Evening Telegraph here, Mr Bloom phoned from the inner office. Is\r\nthe boss...? Yes, Telegraph... To where? Aha! Which auction rooms?...\r\nAha! I see... Right. I\xe2\x80\x99ll catch him. A COLLISION ENSUES\r\n\r\nThe bell whirred again as he rang off. He came in quickly and bumped\r\nagainst Lenehan who was struggling up with the second tissue.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Pardon, monsieur, Lenehan said, clutching him for an instant and making\r\na grimace.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94My fault, Mr Bloom said, suffering his grip. Are you hurt? I\xe2\x80\x99m in a\r\nhurry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Knee, Lenehan said.\r\n\r\nHe made a comic face and whined, rubbing his knee:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94The accumulation of the anno Domini.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Sorry, Mr Bloom said.\r\n\r\nHe went to the door and, holding it ajar, paused. J. J. O\xe2\x80\x99Molloy slapped\r\nthe heavy pages over. The noise of two shrill voices, a mouthorgan,\r\nechoed in the bare hallway from the newsboys squatted on the doorsteps:\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x94We are the boys of Wexford\r\n     Who fought with heart and hand.\r\n\r\nEXIT BLOOM\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99m just running round to Bachelor\xe2\x80\x99s walk, Mr Bloom said, about this\r\nad of Keyes\xe2\x80\x99s. Want to fix it up. They tell me he\xe2\x80\x99s round there in\r\nDillon\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\nHe looked indecisively for a moment at their faces. The editor who,\r\nleaning against the mantelshelf, had propped his head on his hand,\r\nsuddenly stretched forth an arm amply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Begone! he said. The world is before you.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Back in no time, Mr Bloom said, hurrying out.\r\n\r\nJ. J. O\xe2\x80\x99Molloy took the tissues from Lenehan\xe2\x80\x99s hand and read them,\r\nblowing them apart gently, without comment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94He\xe2\x80\x99ll get that advertisement, the professor said, staring through his\r\nblackrimmed spectacles over the crossblind. Look at the young scamps\r\nafter him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Show. Where? Lenehan cried, running to the window. A STREET CORT\xc3\x88GE\r\n\r\nBoth smiled over the crossblind at the file of capering newsboys in Mr\r\nBloom\xe2\x80\x99s wake, the last zigzagging white on the breeze a mocking kite, a\r\ntail of white bowknots.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Look at the young guttersnipe behind him hue and cry, Lenehan said, and\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ll kick. O, my rib risible! Taking off his flat spaugs and the walk.\r\nSmall nines. Steal upon larks.\r\n\r\nHe began to mazurka in swift caricature across the floor on sliding\r\nfeet past the fireplace to J. J. O\xe2\x80\x99Molloy who placed the tissues in his\r\nreceiving hands.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94What\xe2\x80\x99s that? Myles Crawford said with a start. Where are the other two\r\ngone?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Who? the professor said, turning. They\xe2\x80\x99re gone round to the Oval for a\r\ndrink. Paddy Hooper is there with Jack Hall. Came over last night.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Come on then, Myles Crawford said. Where\xe2\x80\x99s my hat?\r\n\r\nHe walked jerkily into the office behind, parting the vent of his\r\njacket, jingling his keys in his back pocket. They jingled then in the\r\nair and against the wood as he locked his desk drawer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94He\xe2\x80\x99s pretty well on, professor MacHugh said in a low voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Seems to be, J. J. O\xe2\x80\x99Molloy said, taking out a cigarettecase in\r\nmurmuring meditation, but it is not always as it seems. Who has the most\r\nmatches? THE CALUMET OF PEACE\r\n\r\nHe offered a cigarette to the professor and took one himself. Lenehan\r\npromptly struck a match for them and lit their cigarettes in turn. J. J.\r\nO\xe2\x80\x99Molloy opened his case again and offered it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Thanky vous, Lenehan said, helping himself.\r\n\r\nThe editor came from the inner office, a straw hat awry on his brow. He\r\ndeclaimed in song, pointing sternly at professor MacHugh:\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x98Twas rank and fame that tempted thee,\r\n      \xe2\x80\x98Twas empire charmed thy heart.\r\n\r\nThe professor grinned, locking his long lips.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Eh? You bloody old Roman empire? Myles Crawford said.\r\n\r\nHe took a cigarette from the open case. Lenehan, lighting it for him\r\nwith quick grace, said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Silence for my brandnew riddle!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Imperium romanum, J. J. O\xe2\x80\x99Molloy said gently. It sounds nobler than\r\nBritish or Brixton. The word reminds one somehow of fat in the fire.\r\n\r\nMyles Crawford blew his first puff violently towards the ceiling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94That\xe2\x80\x99s it, he said. We are the fat. You and I are the fat in the fire.\r\nWe haven\xe2\x80\x99t got the chance of a snowball in hell. THE GRANDEUR THAT WAS\r\nROME\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Wait a moment, professor MacHugh said, raising two quiet claws. We\r\nmustn\xe2\x80\x99t be led away by words, by sounds of words. We think of Rome,\r\nimperial, imperious, imperative.\r\n\r\nHe extended elocutionary arms from frayed stained shirtcuffs, pausing:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94What was their civilisation? Vast, I allow: but vile. Cloacae: sewers.\r\nThe Jews in the wilderness and on the mountaintop said: It is meet to be\r\nhere. Let us build an altar to Jehovah. The Roman, like the Englishman\r\nwho follows in his footsteps, brought to every new shore on which he set\r\nhis foot (on our shore he never set it) only his cloacal obsession. He\r\ngazed about him in his toga and he said: It is meet to be here. Let us\r\nconstruct a watercloset.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Which they accordingly did do, Lenehan said. Our old ancient ancestors,\r\nas we read in the first chapter of Guinness\xe2\x80\x99s, were partial to the\r\nrunning stream.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94They were nature\xe2\x80\x99s gentlemen, J. J. O\xe2\x80\x99Molloy murmured. But we have also\r\nRoman law.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94And Pontius Pilate is its prophet, professor MacHugh responded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Do you know that story about chief baron Palles? J. J. O\xe2\x80\x99Molloy asked.\r\nIt was at the royal university dinner. Everything was going swimmingly\r\n...\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94First my riddle, Lenehan said. Are you ready?\r\n\r\nMr O\xe2\x80\x99Madden Burke, tall in copious grey of Donegal tweed, came in from\r\nthe hallway. Stephen Dedalus, behind him, uncovered as he entered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Entrez, mes enfants! Lenehan cried.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I escort a suppliant, Mr O\xe2\x80\x99Madden Burke said melodiously. Youth led by\r\nExperience visits Notoriety.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94How do you do? the editor said, holding out a hand. Come in. Your\r\ngovernor is just gone. ???\r\n\r\nLenehan said to all:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Silence! What opera resembles a railwayline? Reflect, ponder,\r\nexcogitate, reply.\r\n\r\nStephen handed over the typed sheets, pointing to the title and\r\nsignature.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Who? the editor asked.\r\n\r\nBit torn off.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Mr Garrett Deasy, Stephen said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94That old pelters, the editor said. Who tore it? Was he short taken?\r\n\r\n     On swift sail flaming\r\n     From storm and south\r\n     He comes, pale vampire,\r\n     Mouth to my mouth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Good day, Stephen, the professor said, coming to peer over their\r\nshoulders. Foot and mouth? Are you turned...?\r\n\r\nBullockbefriending bard. SHINDY IN WELLKNOWN RESTAURANT\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Good day, sir, Stephen answered blushing. The letter is not mine. Mr\r\nGarrett Deasy asked me to...\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94O, I know him, Myles Crawford said, and I knew his wife too. The\r\nbloodiest old tartar God ever made. By Jesus, she had the foot and mouth\r\ndisease and no mistake! The night she threw the soup in the waiter\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nface in the Star and Garter. Oho!\r\n\r\nA woman brought sin into the world. For Helen, the runaway wife of\r\nMenelaus, ten years the Greeks. O\xe2\x80\x99Rourke, prince of Breffni.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Is he a widower? Stephen asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Ay, a grass one, Myles Crawford said, his eye running down the\r\ntypescript. Emperor\xe2\x80\x99s horses. Habsburg. An Irishman saved his life on\r\nthe ramparts of Vienna. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you forget! Maximilian Karl O\xe2\x80\x99Donnell,\r\ngraf von Tirconnell in Ireland. Sent his heir over to make the king\r\nan Austrian fieldmarshal now. Going to be trouble there one day. Wild\r\ngeese. O yes, every time. Don\xe2\x80\x99t you forget that!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94The moot point is did he forget it, J. J. O\xe2\x80\x99Molloy said quietly,\r\nturning a horseshoe paperweight. Saving princes is a thank you job.\r\n\r\nProfessor MacHugh turned on him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94And if not? he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you how it was, Myles Crawford began. A Hungarian it was one\r\nday... LOST CAUSES NOBLE MARQUESS MENTIONED\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94We were always loyal to lost causes, the professor said. Success for\r\nus is the death of the intellect and of the imagination. We were never\r\nloyal to the successful. We serve them. I teach the blatant Latin\r\nlanguage. I speak the tongue of a race the acme of whose mentality is\r\nthe maxim: time is money. Material domination. Dominus! Lord! Where is\r\nthe spirituality? Lord Jesus? Lord Salisbury? A sofa in a westend club.\r\nBut the Greek! KYRIE ELEISON!\r\n\r\nA smile of light brightened his darkrimmed eyes, lengthened his long\r\nlips.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94The Greek! he said again. Kyrios! Shining word! The vowels the Semite\r\nand the Saxon know not. Kyrie! The radiance of the intellect. I ought to\r\nprofess Greek, the language of the mind. Kyrie eleison! The closetmaker\r\nand the cloacamaker will never be lords of our spirit. We are liege\r\nsubjects of the catholic chivalry of Europe that foundered at Trafalgar\r\nand of the empire of the spirit, not an imperium, that went under with\r\nthe Athenian fleets at Aegospotami. Yes, yes. They went under. Pyrrhus,\r\nmisled by an oracle, made a last attempt to retrieve the fortunes of\r\nGreece. Loyal to a lost cause.\r\n\r\nHe strode away from them towards the window.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94They went forth to battle, Mr O\xe2\x80\x99Madden Burke said greyly, but they\r\nalways fell.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Boohoo! Lenehan wept with a little noise. Owing to a brick received in\r\nthe latter half of the matin\xc3\xa9e. Poor, poor, poor Pyrrhus!\r\n\r\nHe whispered then near Stephen\xe2\x80\x99s ear: LENEHAN\xe2\x80\x99S LIMERICK\r\n\r\n     There\xe2\x80\x99s a ponderous pundit MacHugh\r\n     Who wears goggles of ebony hue.\r\n     As he mostly sees double\r\n     To wear them why trouble?\r\n     I can\xe2\x80\x99t see the Joe Miller. Can you?\r\n\r\nIn mourning for Sallust, Mulligan says. Whose mother is beastly dead.\r\n\r\nMyles Crawford crammed the sheets into a sidepocket.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94That\xe2\x80\x99ll be all right, he said. I\xe2\x80\x99ll read the rest after. That\xe2\x80\x99ll be all\r\nright.\r\n\r\nLenehan extended his hands in protest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94But my riddle! he said. What opera is like a railwayline?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Opera? Mr O\xe2\x80\x99Madden Burke\xe2\x80\x99s sphinx face reriddled.\r\n\r\nLenehan announced gladly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94The Rose of Castile. See the wheeze? Rows of cast steel. Gee!\r\n\r\nHe poked Mr O\xe2\x80\x99Madden Burke mildly in the spleen. Mr O\xe2\x80\x99Madden Burke fell\r\nback with grace on his umbrella, feigning a gasp.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Help! he sighed. I feel a strong weakness.\r\n\r\nLenehan, rising to tiptoe, fanned his face rapidly with the rustling\r\ntissues.\r\n\r\nThe professor, returning by way of the files, swept his hand across\r\nStephen\xe2\x80\x99s and Mr O\xe2\x80\x99Madden Burke\xe2\x80\x99s loose ties.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Paris, past and present, he said. You look like communards.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Like fellows who had blown up the Bastile, J. J. O\xe2\x80\x99Molloy said in quiet\r\nmockery. Or was it you shot the lord lieutenant of Finland between you?\r\nYou look as though you had done the deed. General Bobrikoff. OMNIUM\r\nGATHERUM\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94We were only thinking about it, Stephen said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94All the talents, Myles Crawford said. Law, the classics...\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94The turf, Lenehan put in.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Literature, the press.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94If Bloom were here, the professor said. The gentle art of\r\nadvertisement.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94And Madam Bloom, Mr O\xe2\x80\x99Madden Burke added. The vocal muse. Dublin\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nprime favourite.\r\n\r\nLenehan gave a loud cough.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Ahem! he said very softly. O, for a fresh of breath air! I caught a\r\ncold in the park. The gate was open. "YOU CAN DO IT!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\nThe editor laid a nervous hand on Stephen\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I want you to write something for me, he said. Something with a bite in\r\nit. You can do it. I see it in your face. In the lexicon of youth ...\r\n\r\nSee it in your face. See it in your eye. Lazy idle little schemer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Foot and mouth disease! the editor cried in scornful invective. Great\r\nnationalist meeting in Borris-in-Ossory. All balls! Bulldosing the\r\npublic! Give them something with a bite in it. Put us all into it, damn\r\nits soul. Father, Son and Holy Ghost and Jakes M\xe2\x80\x99Carthy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94We can all supply mental pabulum, Mr O\xe2\x80\x99Madden Burke said.\r\n\r\nStephen raised his eyes to the bold unheeding stare.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94He wants you for the pressgang, J. J. O\xe2\x80\x99Molloy said. THE GREAT GALLAHER\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94You can do it, Myles Crawford repeated, clenching his hand in emphasis.\r\nWait a minute. We\xe2\x80\x99ll paralyse Europe as Ignatius Gallaher used to say\r\nwhen he was on the shaughraun, doing billiardmarking in the Clarence.\r\nGallaher, that was a pressman for you. That was a pen. You know how he\r\nmade his mark? I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you. That was the smartest piece of\r\njournalism ever known. That was in eightyone, sixth of May, time of\r\nthe invincibles, murder in the Phoenix park, before you were born, I\r\nsuppose. I\xe2\x80\x99ll show you.\r\n\r\nHe pushed past them to the files.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Look at here, he said turning. The New York World cabled for a special.\r\nRemember that time?\r\n\r\nProfessor MacHugh nodded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94New York World, the editor said, excitedly pushing back his straw hat.\r\nWhere it took place. Tim Kelly, or Kavanagh I mean. Joe Brady and the\r\nrest of them. Where Skin-the-Goat drove the car. Whole route, see?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Skin-the-Goat, Mr O\xe2\x80\x99Madden Burke said. Fitzharris. He has that cabman\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nshelter, they say, down there at Butt bridge. Holohan told me. You know\r\nHolohan?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Hop and carry one, is it? Myles Crawford said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94And poor Gumley is down there too, so he told me, minding stones for\r\nthe corporation. A night watchman.\r\n\r\nStephen turned in surprise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Gumley? he said. You don\xe2\x80\x99t say so? A friend of my father\xe2\x80\x99s, is it?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Never mind Gumley, Myles Crawford cried angrily. Let Gumley mind\r\nthe stones, see they don\xe2\x80\x99t run away. Look at here. What did Ignatius\r\nGallaher do? I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you. Inspiration of genius. Cabled right away.\r\nHave you Weekly Freeman of 17 March? Right. Have you got that?\r\n\r\nHe flung back pages of the files and stuck his finger on a point.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Take page four, advertisement for Bransome\xe2\x80\x99s coffee, let us say. Have\r\nyou got that? Right.\r\n\r\nThe telephone whirred. A DISTANT VOICE\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ll answer it, the professor said, going.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94B is parkgate. Good.\r\n\r\nHis finger leaped and struck point after point, vibrating.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94T is viceregal lodge. C is where murder took place. K is Knockmaroon\r\ngate.\r\n\r\nThe loose flesh of his neck shook like a cock\xe2\x80\x99s wattles. An illstarched\r\ndicky jutted up and with a rude gesture he thrust it back into his\r\nwaistcoat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Hello? Evening Telegraph here... Hello?... Who\xe2\x80\x99s there?... Yes...\r\nYes... Yes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94F to P is the route Skin-the-Goat drove the car for an alibi,\r\nInchicore, Roundtown, Windy Arbour, Palmerston Park, Ranelagh. F.A.B.P.\r\nGot that? X is Davy\xe2\x80\x99s publichouse in upper Leeson street.\r\n\r\nThe professor came to the inner door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Bloom is at the telephone, he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Tell him go to hell, the editor said promptly. X is Davy\xe2\x80\x99s publichouse,\r\nsee? CLEVER, VERY\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Clever, Lenehan said. Very.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Gave it to them on a hot plate, Myles Crawford said, the whole bloody\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\nNightmare from which you will never awake.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I saw it, the editor said proudly. I was present. Dick Adams, the\r\nbesthearted bloody Corkman the Lord ever put the breath of life in, and\r\nmyself.\r\n\r\nLenehan bowed to a shape of air, announcing:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Madam, I\xe2\x80\x99m Adam. And Able was I ere I saw Elba.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94History! Myles Crawford cried. The Old Woman of Prince\xe2\x80\x99s street was\r\nthere first. There was weeping and gnashing of teeth over that. Out of\r\nan advertisement. Gregor Grey made the design for it. That gave him the\r\nleg up. Then Paddy Hooper worked Tay Pay who took him on to the Star.\r\nNow he\xe2\x80\x99s got in with Blumenfeld. That\xe2\x80\x99s press. That\xe2\x80\x99s talent. Pyatt! He\r\nwas all their daddies!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94The father of scare journalism, Lenehan confirmed, and the\r\nbrother-in-law of Chris Callinan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Hello?... Are you there?... Yes, he\xe2\x80\x99s here still. Come across yourself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Where do you find a pressman like that now, eh? the editor cried.\r\n\r\nHe flung the pages down.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Clamn dever, Lenehan said to Mr O\xe2\x80\x99Madden Burke.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Very smart, Mr O\xe2\x80\x99Madden Burke said.\r\n\r\nProfessor MacHugh came from the inner office.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Talking about the invincibles, he said, did you see that some hawkers\r\nwere up before the recorder...\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94O yes, J. J. O\xe2\x80\x99Molloy said eagerly. Lady Dudley was walking home\r\nthrough the park to see all the trees that were blown down by that\r\ncyclone last year and thought she\xe2\x80\x99d buy a view of Dublin. And it\r\nturned out to be a commemoration postcard of Joe Brady or Number One or\r\nSkin-the-Goat. Right outside the viceregal lodge, imagine!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94They\xe2\x80\x99re only in the hook and eye department, Myles Crawford said.\r\nPsha! Press and the bar! Where have you a man now at the bar like those\r\nfellows, like Whiteside, like Isaac Butt, like silvertongued O\xe2\x80\x99Hagan.\r\nEh? Ah, bloody nonsense. Psha! Only in the halfpenny place.\r\n\r\nHis mouth continued to twitch unspeaking in nervous curls of disdain.\r\n\r\nWould anyone wish that mouth for her kiss? How do you know? Why did you\r\nwrite it then? RHYMES AND REASONS\r\n\r\nMouth, south. Is the mouth south someway? Or the south a mouth? Must be\r\nsome. South, pout, out, shout, drouth. Rhymes: two men dressed the same,\r\nlooking the same, two by two.\r\n\r\n     ........................ la tua pace\r\n    .................. che parlar ti piace\r\n    Mentre che il vento, come fa, si tace.\r\n\r\nHe saw them three by three, approaching girls, in green, in rose, in\r\nrusset, entwining, per l\xe2\x80\x99aer perso, in mauve, in purple, quella pacifica\r\noriafiamma, gold of oriflamme, di rimirar f\xc3\xa8 pi\xc3\xb9 ardenti. But I old\r\nmen, penitent, leadenfooted, underdarkneath the night: mouth south: tomb\r\nwomb.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Speak up for yourself, Mr O\xe2\x80\x99Madden Burke said. SUFFICIENT FOR THE\r\nDAY...\r\n\r\nJ. J. O\xe2\x80\x99Molloy, smiling palely, took up the gage.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94My dear Myles, he said, flinging his cigarette aside, you put a false\r\nconstruction on my words. I hold no brief, as at present advised, for\r\nthe third profession qua profession but your Cork legs are running away\r\nwith you. Why not bring in Henry Grattan and Flood and Demosthenes and\r\nEdmund Burke? Ignatius Gallaher we all know and his Chapelizod boss,\r\nHarmsworth of the farthing press, and his American cousin of the Bowery\r\nguttersheet not to mention Paddy Kelly\xe2\x80\x99s Budget, Pue\xe2\x80\x99s Occurrences\r\nand our watchful friend The Skibbereen Eagle. Why bring in a master\r\nof forensic eloquence like Whiteside? Sufficient for the day is the\r\nnewspaper thereof. LINKS WITH BYGONE DAYS OF YORE\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Grattan and Flood wrote for this very paper, the editor cried in his\r\nface. Irish volunteers. Where are you now? Established 1763. Dr Lucas.\r\nWho have you now like John Philpot Curran? Psha!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Well, J. J. O\xe2\x80\x99Molloy said, Bushe K.C., for example.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Bushe? the editor said. Well, yes: Bushe, yes. He has a strain of it in\r\nhis blood. Kendal Bushe or I mean Seymour Bushe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94He would have been on the bench long ago, the professor said, only for\r\n... But no matter.\r\n\r\nJ. J. O\xe2\x80\x99Molloy turned to Stephen and said quietly and slowly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94One of the most polished periods I think I ever listened to in my life\r\nfell from the lips of Seymour Bushe. It was in that case of fratricide,\r\nthe Childs murder case. Bushe defended him.\r\n\r\nAnd in the porches of mine ear did pour.\r\n\r\nBy the way how did he find that out? He died in his sleep. Or the other\r\nstory, beast with two backs?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94What was that? the professor asked. ITALIA, MAGISTRA ARTIUM\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94He spoke on the law of evidence, J. J. O\xe2\x80\x99Molloy said, of Roman justice\r\nas contrasted with the earlier Mosaic code, the lex talionis. And he\r\ncited the Moses of Michelangelo in the vatican.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Ha.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94A few wellchosen words, Lenehan prefaced. Silence!\r\n\r\nPause. J. J. O\xe2\x80\x99Molloy took out his cigarettecase.\r\n\r\nFalse lull. Something quite ordinary.\r\n\r\nMessenger took out his matchbox thoughtfully and lit his cigar.\r\n\r\nI have often thought since on looking back over that strange time that\r\nit was that small act, trivial in itself, that striking of that match,\r\nthat determined the whole aftercourse of both our lives. A POLISHED\r\nPERIOD\r\n\r\nJ. J. O\xe2\x80\x99Molloy resumed, moulding his words:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94He said of it: that stony effigy in frozen music, horned and terrible,\r\nof the human form divine, that eternal symbol of wisdom and of prophecy\r\nwhich, if aught that the imagination or the hand of sculptor has wrought\r\nin marble of soultransfigured and of soultransfiguring deserves to live,\r\ndeserves to live.\r\n\r\nHis slim hand with a wave graced echo and fall.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Fine! Myles Crawford said at once.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94The divine afflatus, Mr O\xe2\x80\x99Madden Burke said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94You like it? J. J. O\xe2\x80\x99Molloy asked Stephen.\r\n\r\nStephen, his blood wooed by grace of language and gesture, blushed. He\r\ntook a cigarette from the case. J. J. O\xe2\x80\x99Molloy offered his case to Myles\r\nCrawford. Lenehan lit their cigarettes as before and took his trophy,\r\nsaying:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Muchibus thankibus. A MAN OF HIGH MORALE\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Professor Magennis was speaking to me about you, J. J. O\xe2\x80\x99Molloy said to\r\nStephen. What do you think really of that hermetic crowd, the opal hush\r\npoets: A. E. the mastermystic? That Blavatsky woman started it. She was\r\na nice old bag of tricks. A. E. has been telling some yankee interviewer\r\nthat you came to him in the small hours of the morning to ask him about\r\nplanes of consciousness. Magennis thinks you must have been pulling A.\r\nE.\xe2\x80\x98s leg. He is a man of the very highest morale, Magennis.\r\n\r\nSpeaking about me. What did he say? What did he say? What did he say\r\nabout me? Don\xe2\x80\x99t ask.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94No, thanks, professor MacHugh said, waving the cigarettecase aside.\r\nWait a moment. Let me say one thing. The finest display of oratory I\r\never heard was a speech made by John F Taylor at the college historical\r\nsociety. Mr Justice Fitzgibbon, the present lord justice of appeal, had\r\nspoken and the paper under debate was an essay (new for those days),\r\nadvocating the revival of the Irish tongue.\r\n\r\nHe turned towards Myles Crawford and said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94You know Gerald Fitzgibbon. Then you can imagine the style of his\r\ndiscourse.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94He is sitting with Tim Healy, J. J. O\xe2\x80\x99Molloy said, rumour has it, on\r\nthe Trinity college estates commission.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94He is sitting with a sweet thing, Myles Crawford said, in a child\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfrock. Go on. Well?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94It was the speech, mark you, the professor said, of a finished orator,\r\nfull of courteous haughtiness and pouring in chastened diction I will\r\nnot say the vials of his wrath but pouring the proud man\xe2\x80\x99s contumely\r\nupon the new movement. It was then a new movement. We were weak,\r\ntherefore worthless.\r\n\r\nHe closed his long thin lips an instant but, eager to be on, raised\r\nan outspanned hand to his spectacles and, with trembling thumb and\r\nringfinger touching lightly the black rims, steadied them to a new\r\nfocus. IMPROMPTU\r\n\r\nIn ferial tone he addressed J. J. O\xe2\x80\x99Molloy:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Taylor had come there, you must know, from a sickbed. That he had\r\nprepared his speech I do not believe for there was not even one\r\nshorthandwriter in the hall. His dark lean face had a growth of shaggy\r\nbeard round it. He wore a loose white silk neckcloth and altogether he\r\nlooked (though he was not) a dying man.\r\n\r\nHis gaze turned at once but slowly from J. J. O\xe2\x80\x99Molloy\xe2\x80\x99s towards\r\nStephen\xe2\x80\x99s face and then bent at once to the ground, seeking. His\r\nunglazed linen collar appeared behind his bent head, soiled by his\r\nwithering hair. Still seeking, he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94When Fitzgibbon\xe2\x80\x99s speech had ended John F Taylor rose to reply.\r\nBriefly, as well as I can bring them to mind, his words were these.\r\n\r\nHe raised his head firmly. His eyes bethought themselves once more.\r\nWitless shellfish swam in the gross lenses to and fro, seeking outlet.\r\n\r\nHe began:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Mr Chairman, ladies and gentlemen: Great was my admiration in listening\r\nto the remarks addressed to the youth of Ireland a moment since by\r\nmy learned friend. It seemed to me that I had been transported into a\r\ncountry far away from this country, into an age remote from this age,\r\nthat I stood in ancient Egypt and that I was listening to the speech of\r\nsome highpriest of that land addressed to the youthful Moses.\r\n\r\nHis listeners held their cigarettes poised to hear, their smokes\r\nascending in frail stalks that flowered with his speech. And let our\r\ncrooked smokes. Noble words coming. Look out. Could you try your hand at\r\nit yourself?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94And it seemed to me that I heard the voice of that Egyptian highpriest\r\nraised in a tone of like haughtiness and like pride. I heard his words\r\nand their meaning was revealed to me. FROM THE FATHERS\r\n\r\nIt was revealed to me that those things are good which yet are corrupted\r\nwhich neither if they were supremely good nor unless they were good\r\ncould be corrupted. Ah, curse you! That\xe2\x80\x99s saint Augustine.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Why will you jews not accept our culture, our religion and our\r\nlanguage? You are a tribe of nomad herdsmen: we are a mighty people. You\r\nhave no cities nor no wealth: our cities are hives of humanity and\r\nour galleys, trireme and quadrireme, laden with all manner merchandise\r\nfurrow the waters of the known globe. You have but emerged from\r\nprimitive conditions: we have a literature, a priesthood, an agelong\r\nhistory and a polity.\r\n\r\nNile.\r\n\r\nChild, man, effigy.\r\n\r\nBy the Nilebank the babemaries kneel, cradle of bulrushes: a man supple\r\nin combat: stonehorned, stonebearded, heart of stone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94You pray to a local and obscure idol: our temples, majestic and\r\nmysterious, are the abodes of Isis and Osiris, of Horus and Ammon Ra.\r\nYours serfdom, awe and humbleness: ours thunder and the seas. Israel\r\nis weak and few are her children: Egypt is an host and terrible are her\r\narms. Vagrants and daylabourers are you called: the world trembles at\r\nour name.\r\n\r\nA dumb belch of hunger cleft his speech. He lifted his voice above it\r\nboldly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94But, ladies and gentlemen, had the youthful Moses listened to and\r\naccepted that view of life, had he bowed his head and bowed his will\r\nand bowed his spirit before that arrogant admonition he would never have\r\nbrought the chosen people out of their house of bondage, nor followed\r\nthe pillar of the cloud by day. He would never have spoken with the\r\nEternal amid lightnings on Sinai\xe2\x80\x99s mountaintop nor ever have come down\r\nwith the light of inspiration shining in his countenance and bearing in\r\nhis arms the tables of the law, graven in the language of the outlaw.\r\n\r\nHe ceased and looked at them, enjoying a silence. OMINOUS\xe2\x80\x94FOR HIM!\r\n\r\nJ. J. O\xe2\x80\x99Molloy said not without regret:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94And yet he died without having entered the land of promise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94A sudden\xe2\x80\x94at\xe2\x80\x94the\xe2\x80\x94moment\xe2\x80\x94though\xe2\x80\x94from\xe2\x80\x94lingering\xe2\x80\x94illness\xe2\x80\x94often\xe2\x80\x94\r\npreviously\xe2\x80\x94expectorated\xe2\x80\x94demise, Lenehan added. And with a great future\r\nbehind him.\r\n\r\nThe troop of bare feet was heard rushing along the hallway and pattering\r\nup the staircase.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94That is oratory, the professor said uncontradicted.\r\n\r\nGone with the wind. Hosts at Mullaghmast and Tara of the kings. Miles of\r\nears of porches. The tribune\xe2\x80\x99s words, howled and scattered to the four\r\nwinds. A people sheltered within his voice. Dead noise. Akasic records\r\nof all that ever anywhere wherever was. Love and laud him: me no more.\r\n\r\nI have money.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Gentlemen, Stephen said. As the next motion on the agenda paper may I\r\nsuggest that the house do now adjourn?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94You take my breath away. It is not perchance a French compliment?\r\nMr O\xe2\x80\x99Madden Burke asked. \xe2\x80\x98Tis the hour, methinks, when the winejug,\r\nmetaphorically speaking, is most grateful in Ye ancient hostelry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94That it be and hereby is resolutely resolved. All that are in favour\r\nsay ay, Lenehan announced. The contrary no. I declare it carried. To\r\nwhich particular boosing shed...? My casting vote is: Mooney\xe2\x80\x99s!\r\n\r\nHe led the way, admonishing:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94We will sternly refuse to partake of strong waters, will we not? Yes,\r\nwe will not. By no manner of means.\r\n\r\nMr O\xe2\x80\x99Madden Burke, following close, said with an ally\xe2\x80\x99s lunge of his\r\numbrella:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Lay on, Macduff!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Chip of the old block! the editor cried, clapping Stephen on the\r\nshoulder. Let us go. Where are those blasted keys?\r\n\r\nHe fumbled in his pocket pulling out the crushed typesheets.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Foot and mouth. I know. That\xe2\x80\x99ll be all right. That\xe2\x80\x99ll go in. Where are\r\nthey? That\xe2\x80\x99s all right.\r\n\r\nHe thrust the sheets back and went into the inner office. LET US HOPE\r\n\r\nJ. J. O\xe2\x80\x99Molloy, about to follow him in, said quietly to Stephen:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I hope you will live to see it published. Myles, one moment.\r\n\r\nHe went into the inner office, closing the door behind him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Come along, Stephen, the professor said. That is fine, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it? It has\r\nthe prophetic vision. Fuit Ilium! The sack of windy Troy. Kingdoms of\r\nthis world. The masters of the Mediterranean are fellaheen today.\r\n\r\nThe first newsboy came pattering down the stairs at their heels and\r\nrushed out into the street, yelling:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Racing special!\r\n\r\nDublin. I have much, much to learn.\r\n\r\nThey turned to the left along Abbey street.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I have a vision too, Stephen said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Yes? the professor said, skipping to get into step. Crawford will\r\nfollow.\r\n\r\nAnother newsboy shot past them, yelling as he ran:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Racing special! DEAR DIRTY DUBLIN\r\n\r\nDubliners.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Two Dublin vestals, Stephen said, elderly and pious, have lived fifty\r\nand fiftythree years in Fumbally\xe2\x80\x99s lane.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Where is that? the professor asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Off Blackpitts, Stephen said.\r\n\r\nDamp night reeking of hungry dough. Against the wall. Face glistering\r\ntallow under her fustian shawl. Frantic hearts. Akasic records. Quicker,\r\ndarlint!\r\n\r\nOn now. Dare it. Let there be life.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94They want to see the views of Dublin from the top of Nelson\xe2\x80\x99s pillar.\r\nThey save up three and tenpence in a red tin letterbox moneybox. They\r\nshake out the threepenny bits and sixpences and coax out the pennies\r\nwith the blade of a knife. Two and three in silver and one and seven\r\nin coppers. They put on their bonnets and best clothes and take their\r\numbrellas for fear it may come on to rain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Wise virgins, professor MacHugh said. LIFE ON THE RAW\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94They buy one and fourpenceworth of brawn and four slices of panloaf at\r\nthe north city diningrooms in Marlborough street from Miss Kate Collins,\r\nproprietress... They purchase four and twenty ripe plums from a girl at\r\nthe foot of Nelson\xe2\x80\x99s pillar to take off the thirst of the brawn. They\r\ngive two threepenny bits to the gentleman at the turnstile and begin\r\nto waddle slowly up the winding staircase, grunting, encouraging each\r\nother, afraid of the dark, panting, one asking the other have you the\r\nbrawn, praising God and the Blessed Virgin, threatening to come down,\r\npeeping at the airslits. Glory be to God. They had no idea it was that\r\nhigh.\r\n\r\nTheir names are Anne Kearns and Florence MacCabe. Anne Kearns has the\r\nlumbago for which she rubs on Lourdes water, given her by a lady who got\r\na bottleful from a passionist father. Florence MacCabe takes a crubeen\r\nand a bottle of double X for supper every Saturday.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Antithesis, the professor said nodding twice. Vestal virgins. I can see\r\nthem. What\xe2\x80\x99s keeping our friend?\r\n\r\nHe turned.\r\n\r\nA bevy of scampering newsboys rushed down the steps, scattering in all\r\ndirections, yelling, their white papers fluttering. Hard after them\r\nMyles Crawford appeared on the steps, his hat aureoling his scarlet\r\nface, talking with J. J. O\xe2\x80\x99Molloy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Come along, the professor cried, waving his arm.\r\n\r\nHe set off again to walk by Stephen\xe2\x80\x99s side. RETURN OF BLOOM\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Yes, he said. I see them.\r\n\r\nMr Bloom, breathless, caught in a whirl of wild newsboys near the\r\noffices of the Irish Catholic and Dublin Penny Journal, called:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Mr Crawford! A moment!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Telegraph! Racing special!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94What is it? Myles Crawford said, falling back a pace.\r\n\r\nA newsboy cried in Mr Bloom\xe2\x80\x99s face:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Terrible tragedy in Rathmines! A child bit by a bellows! INTERVIEW WITH\r\nTHE EDITOR\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Just this ad, Mr Bloom said, pushing through towards the steps,\r\npuffing, and taking the cutting from his pocket. I spoke with Mr Keyes\r\njust now. He\xe2\x80\x99ll give a renewal for two months, he says. After he\xe2\x80\x99ll see.\r\nBut he wants a par to call attention in the Telegraph too, the Saturday\r\npink. And he wants it copied if it\xe2\x80\x99s not too late I told councillor\r\nNannetti from the Kilkenny People. I can have access to it in the\r\nnational library. House of keys, don\xe2\x80\x99t you see? His name is Keyes. It\xe2\x80\x99s\r\na play on the name. But he practically promised he\xe2\x80\x99d give the renewal.\r\nBut he wants just a little puff. What will I tell him, Mr Crawford?\r\nK.M.A.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Will you tell him he can kiss my arse? Myles Crawford said throwing out\r\nhis arm for emphasis. Tell him that straight from the stable.\r\n\r\nA bit nervy. Look out for squalls. All off for a drink. Arm in arm.\r\nLenehan\xe2\x80\x99s yachting cap on the cadge beyond. Usual blarney. Wonder is\r\nthat young Dedalus the moving spirit. Has a good pair of boots on him\r\ntoday. Last time I saw him he had his heels on view. Been walking in\r\nmuck somewhere. Careless chap. What was he doing in Irishtown?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Well, Mr Bloom said, his eyes returning, if I can get the design I\r\nsuppose it\xe2\x80\x99s worth a short par. He\xe2\x80\x99d give the ad, I think. I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell\r\nhim... K.M.R.I.A.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94He can kiss my royal Irish arse, Myles Crawford cried loudly over his\r\nshoulder. Any time he likes, tell him.\r\n\r\nWhile Mr Bloom stood weighing the point and about to smile he strode on\r\njerkily. RAISING THE WIND\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Nulla bona, Jack, he said, raising his hand to his chin. I\xe2\x80\x99m up to\r\nhere. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been through the hoop myself. I was looking for a fellow to\r\nback a bill for me no later than last week. Sorry, Jack. You must take\r\nthe will for the deed. With a heart and a half if I could raise the wind\r\nanyhow.\r\n\r\nJ. J. O\xe2\x80\x99Molloy pulled a long face and walked on silently. They caught up\r\non the others and walked abreast.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94When they have eaten the brawn and the bread and wiped their twenty\r\nfingers in the paper the bread was wrapped in they go nearer to the\r\nrailings.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Something for you, the professor explained to Myles Crawford. Two old\r\nDublin women on the top of Nelson\xe2\x80\x99s pillar. SOME COLUMN!\xe2\x80\x94THAT\xe2\x80\x99S WHAT\r\nWADDLER ONE SAID\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94That\xe2\x80\x99s new, Myles Crawford said. That\xe2\x80\x99s copy. Out for the waxies\xe2\x80\x99\r\nDargle. Two old trickies, what?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94But they are afraid the pillar will fall, Stephen went on. They see the\r\nroofs and argue about where the different churches are: Rathmines\xe2\x80\x99 blue\r\ndome, Adam and Eve\xe2\x80\x99s, saint Laurence O\xe2\x80\x99Toole\xe2\x80\x99s. But it makes them giddy\r\nto look so they pull up their skirts... THOSE SLIGHTLY RAMBUNCTIOUS\r\nFEMALES\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Easy all, Myles Crawford said. No poetic licence. We\xe2\x80\x99re in the\r\narchdiocese here.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94And settle down on their striped petticoats, peering up at the statue\r\nof the onehandled adulterer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Onehandled adulterer! the professor cried. I like that. I see the idea.\r\nI see what you mean. DAMES DONATE DUBLIN\xe2\x80\x99S CITS SPEEDPILLS VELOCITOUS\r\nAEROLITHS, BELIEF\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94It gives them a crick in their necks, Stephen said, and they are too\r\ntired to look up or down or to speak. They put the bag of plums between\r\nthem and eat the plums out of it, one after another, wiping off with\r\ntheir handkerchiefs the plumjuice that dribbles out of their mouths and\r\nspitting the plumstones slowly out between the railings.\r\n\r\nHe gave a sudden loud young laugh as a close. Lenehan and Mr O\xe2\x80\x99Madden\r\nBurke, hearing, turned, beckoned and led on across towards Mooney\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Finished? Myles Crawford said. So long as they do no worse. SOPHIST\r\nWALLOPS HAUGHTY HELEN SQUARE ON PROBOSCIS. SPARTANS GNASH MOLARS.\r\nITHACANS VOW PEN IS CHAMP.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94You remind me of Antisthenes, the professor said, a disciple of\r\nGorgias, the sophist. It is said of him that none could tell if he were\r\nbitterer against others or against himself. He was the son of a noble\r\nand a bondwoman. And he wrote a book in which he took away the palm of\r\nbeauty from Argive Helen and handed it to poor Penelope.\r\n\r\nPoor Penelope. Penelope Rich.\r\n\r\nThey made ready to cross O\xe2\x80\x99Connell street. HELLO THERE, CENTRAL!\r\n\r\nAt various points along the eight lines tramcars with motionless\r\ntrolleys stood in their tracks, bound for or from Rathmines,\r\nRathfarnham, Blackrock, Kingstown and Dalkey, Sandymount Green, Ringsend\r\nand Sandymount Tower, Donnybrook, Palmerston Park and Upper Rathmines,\r\nall still, becalmed in short circuit. Hackney cars, cabs, delivery\r\nwaggons, mailvans, private broughams, aerated mineral water floats\r\nwith rattling crates of bottles, rattled, rolled, horsedrawn, rapidly.\r\nWHAT?\xe2\x80\x94AND LIKEWISE\xe2\x80\x94WHERE?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94But what do you call it? Myles Crawford asked. Where did they get the\r\nplums? VIRGILIAN, SAYS PEDAGOGUE. SOPHOMORE PLUMPS FOR OLD MAN MOSES.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Call it, wait, the professor said, opening his long lips wide to\r\nreflect. Call it, let me see. Call it: deus nobis h\xc3\xa6c otia fecit.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94No, Stephen said. I call it A Pisgah Sight of Palestine or The Parable\r\nof The Plums.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I see, the professor said.\r\n\r\nHe laughed richly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I see, he said again with new pleasure. Moses and the promised land. We\r\ngave him that idea, he added to J. J. O\xe2\x80\x99Molloy. HORATIO IS CYNOSURE THIS\r\nFAIR JUNE DAY\r\n\r\nJ. J. O\xe2\x80\x99Molloy sent a weary sidelong glance towards the statue and held\r\nhis peace.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I see, the professor said.\r\n\r\nHe halted on sir John Gray\xe2\x80\x99s pavement island and peered aloft at\r\nNelson through the meshes of his wry smile. DIMINISHED DIGITS PROVE TOO\r\nTITILLATING FOR FRISKY FRUMPS. ANNE WIMBLES, FLO WANGLES\xe2\x80\x94YET CAN YOU\r\nBLAME THEM?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Onehandled adulterer, he said smiling grimly. That tickles me, I must\r\nsay.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Tickled the old ones too, Myles Crawford said, if the God Almighty\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntruth was known.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[ 8 ]\r\n\r\nPineapple rock, lemon platt, butter scotch. A sugarsticky girl\r\nshovelling scoopfuls of creams for a christian brother. Some school\r\ntreat. Bad for their tummies. Lozenge and comfit manufacturer to His\r\nMajesty the King. God. Save. Our. Sitting on his throne sucking red\r\njujubes white.\r\n\r\nA sombre Y.M.C.A. young man, watchful among the warm sweet fumes of\r\nGraham Lemon\xe2\x80\x99s, placed a throwaway in a hand of Mr Bloom.\r\n\r\nHeart to heart talks.\r\n\r\nBloo... Me? No.\r\n\r\nBlood of the Lamb.\r\n\r\nHis slow feet walked him riverward, reading. Are you saved? All are\r\nwashed in the blood of the lamb. God wants blood victim. Birth, hymen,\r\nmartyr, war, foundation of a building, sacrifice, kidney burntoffering,\r\ndruids\xe2\x80\x99 altars. Elijah is coming. Dr John Alexander Dowie restorer of\r\nthe church in Zion is coming.\r\n\r\n      Is coming! Is coming!! Is coming!!!\r\n      All heartily welcome.\r\n\r\nPaying game. Torry and Alexander last year. Polygamy. His wife will put\r\nthe stopper on that. Where was that ad some Birmingham firm the luminous\r\ncrucifix. Our Saviour. Wake up in the dead of night and see him on the\r\nwall, hanging. Pepper\xe2\x80\x99s ghost idea. Iron Nails Ran In.\r\n\r\nPhosphorus it must be done with. If you leave a bit of codfish for\r\ninstance. I could see the bluey silver over it. Night I went down to the\r\npantry in the kitchen. Don\xe2\x80\x99t like all the smells in it waiting to rush\r\nout. What was it she wanted? The Malaga raisins. Thinking of Spain.\r\nBefore Rudy was born. The phosphorescence, that bluey greeny. Very good\r\nfor the brain.\r\n\r\nFrom Butler\xe2\x80\x99s monument house corner he glanced along Bachelor\xe2\x80\x99s walk.\r\nDedalus\xe2\x80\x99 daughter there still outside Dillon\xe2\x80\x99s auctionrooms. Must be\r\nselling off some old furniture. Knew her eyes at once from the father.\r\nLobbing about waiting for him. Home always breaks up when the mother\r\ngoes. Fifteen children he had. Birth every year almost. That\xe2\x80\x99s in their\r\ntheology or the priest won\xe2\x80\x99t give the poor woman the confession, the\r\nabsolution. Increase and multiply. Did you ever hear such an idea? Eat\r\nyou out of house and home. No families themselves to feed. Living on the\r\nfat of the land. Their butteries and larders. I\xe2\x80\x99d like to see them do\r\nthe black fast Yom Kippur. Crossbuns. One meal and a collation for fear\r\nhe\xe2\x80\x99d collapse on the altar. A housekeeper of one of those fellows if you\r\ncould pick it out of her. Never pick it out of her. Like getting \xc2\xa3.\r\ns. d. out of him. Does himself well. No guests. All for number one.\r\nWatching his water. Bring your own bread and butter. His reverence:\r\nmum\xe2\x80\x99s the word.\r\n\r\nGood Lord, that poor child\xe2\x80\x99s dress is in flitters. Underfed she looks\r\ntoo. Potatoes and marge, marge and potatoes. It\xe2\x80\x99s after they feel it.\r\nProof of the pudding. Undermines the constitution.\r\n\r\nAs he set foot on O\xe2\x80\x99Connell bridge a puffball of smoke plumed up from\r\nthe parapet. Brewery barge with export stout. England. Sea air sours it,\r\nI heard. Be interesting some day get a pass through Hancock to see the\r\nbrewery. Regular world in itself. Vats of porter wonderful. Rats get in\r\ntoo. Drink themselves bloated as big as a collie floating. Dead drunk on\r\nthe porter. Drink till they puke again like christians. Imagine drinking\r\nthat! Rats: vats. Well, of course, if we knew all the things.\r\n\r\nLooking down he saw flapping strongly, wheeling between the gaunt\r\nquaywalls, gulls. Rough weather outside. If I threw myself down? Reuben\r\nJ\xe2\x80\x99s son must have swallowed a good bellyful of that sewage. One and\r\neightpence too much. Hhhhm. It\xe2\x80\x99s the droll way he comes out with the\r\nthings. Knows how to tell a story too.\r\n\r\nThey wheeled lower. Looking for grub. Wait.\r\n\r\nHe threw down among them a crumpled paper ball. Elijah thirtytwo feet\r\nper sec is com. Not a bit. The ball bobbed unheeded on the wake of\r\nswells, floated under by the bridgepiers. Not such damn fools. Also the\r\nday I threw that stale cake out of the Erin\xe2\x80\x99s King picked it up in the\r\nwake fifty yards astern. Live by their wits. They wheeled, flapping.\r\n\r\n     The hungry famished gull\r\n     Flaps o\xe2\x80\x99er the waters dull.\r\n\r\nThat is how poets write, the similar sounds. But then Shakespeare has\r\nno rhymes: blank verse. The flow of the language it is. The thoughts.\r\nSolemn.\r\n\r\n     Hamlet, I am thy father\xe2\x80\x99s spirit\r\n     Doomed for a certain time to walk the earth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Two apples a penny! Two for a penny!\r\n\r\nHis gaze passed over the glazed apples serried on her stand. Australians\r\nthey must be this time of year. Shiny peels: polishes them up with a rag\r\nor a handkerchief.\r\n\r\nWait. Those poor birds.\r\n\r\nHe halted again and bought from the old applewoman two Banbury cakes for\r\na penny and broke the brittle paste and threw its fragments down into\r\nthe Liffey. See that? The gulls swooped silently, two, then all from\r\ntheir heights, pouncing on prey. Gone. Every morsel.\r\n\r\nAware of their greed and cunning he shook the powdery crumb from his\r\nhands. They never expected that. Manna. Live on fish, fishy flesh they\r\nhave, all seabirds, gulls, seagoose. Swans from Anna Liffey swim down\r\nhere sometimes to preen themselves. No accounting for tastes. Wonder\r\nwhat kind is swanmeat. Robinson Crusoe had to live on them.\r\n\r\nThey wheeled flapping weakly. I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to throw any more. Penny\r\nquite enough. Lot of thanks I get. Not even a caw. They spread foot and\r\nmouth disease too. If you cram a turkey say on chestnutmeal it tastes\r\nlike that. Eat pig like pig. But then why is it that saltwater fish are\r\nnot salty? How is that?\r\n\r\nHis eyes sought answer from the river and saw a rowboat rock at anchor\r\non the treacly swells lazily its plastered board.\r\n\r\n      Kino\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n      11/-\r\n      Trousers\r\n\r\nGood idea that. Wonder if he pays rent to the corporation. How can you\r\nown water really? It\xe2\x80\x99s always flowing in a stream, never the same, which\r\nin the stream of life we trace. Because life is a stream. All kinds of\r\nplaces are good for ads. That quack doctor for the clap used to be stuck\r\nup in all the greenhouses. Never see it now. Strictly confidential. Dr\r\nHy Franks. Didn\xe2\x80\x99t cost him a red like Maginni the dancing master self\r\nadvertisement. Got fellows to stick them up or stick them up himself for\r\nthat matter on the q. t. running in to loosen a button. Flybynight.\r\nJust the place too. POST NO BILLS. POST 110 PILLS. Some chap with a dose\r\nburning him.\r\n\r\nIf he...?\r\n\r\nO!\r\n\r\nEh?\r\n\r\nNo... No.\r\n\r\nNo, no. I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe it. He wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t surely?\r\n\r\nNo, no.\r\n\r\nMr Bloom moved forward, raising his troubled eyes. Think no more about\r\nthat. After one. Timeball on the ballastoffice is down. Dunsink time.\r\nFascinating little book that is of sir Robert Ball\xe2\x80\x99s. Parallax. I never\r\nexactly understood. There\xe2\x80\x99s a priest. Could ask him. Par it\xe2\x80\x99s Greek:\r\nparallel, parallax. Met him pike hoses she called it till I told her\r\nabout the transmigration. O rocks!\r\n\r\nMr Bloom smiled O rocks at two windows of the ballastoffice. She\xe2\x80\x99s right\r\nafter all. Only big words for ordinary things on account of the sound.\r\nShe\xe2\x80\x99s not exactly witty. Can be rude too. Blurt out what I was thinking.\r\nStill, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. She used to say Ben Dollard had a base barreltone\r\nvoice. He has legs like barrels and you\xe2\x80\x99d think he was singing into a\r\nbarrel. Now, isn\xe2\x80\x99t that wit. They used to call him big Ben. Not half as\r\nwitty as calling him base barreltone. Appetite like an albatross. Get\r\noutside of a baron of beef. Powerful man he was at stowing away number\r\none Bass. Barrel of Bass. See? It all works out.\r\n\r\nA procession of whitesmocked sandwichmen marched slowly towards him\r\nalong the gutter, scarlet sashes across their boards. Bargains. Like\r\nthat priest they are this morning: we have sinned: we have suffered. He\r\nread the scarlet letters on their five tall white hats: H. E. L. Y. S.\r\nWisdom Hely\xe2\x80\x99s. Y lagging behind drew a chunk of bread from under his\r\nforeboard, crammed it into his mouth and munched as he walked. Our\r\nstaple food. Three bob a day, walking along the gutters, street after\r\nstreet. Just keep skin and bone together, bread and skilly. They are\r\nnot Boyl: no, M\xe2\x80\x99Glade\xe2\x80\x99s men. Doesn\xe2\x80\x99t bring in any business either.\r\nI suggested to him about a transparent showcart with two smart girls\r\nsitting inside writing letters, copybooks, envelopes, blottingpaper. I\r\nbet that would have caught on. Smart girls writing something catch the\r\neye at once. Everyone dying to know what she\xe2\x80\x99s writing. Get twenty of\r\nthem round you if you stare at nothing. Have a finger in the pie. Women\r\ntoo. Curiosity. Pillar of salt. Wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have it of course because he\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t think of it himself first. Or the inkbottle I suggested with a\r\nfalse stain of black celluloid. His ideas for ads like Plumtree\xe2\x80\x99s potted\r\nunder the obituaries, cold meat department. You can\xe2\x80\x99t lick \xe2\x80\x98em. What?\r\nOur envelopes. Hello, Jones, where are you going? Can\xe2\x80\x99t stop, Robinson,\r\nI am hastening to purchase the only reliable inkeraser Kansell, sold by\r\nHely\xe2\x80\x99s Ltd, 85 Dame street. Well out of that ruck I am. Devil of a job\r\nit was collecting accounts of those convents. Tranquilla convent. That\r\nwas a nice nun there, really sweet face. Wimple suited her small head.\r\nSister? Sister? I am sure she was crossed in love by her eyes. Very hard\r\nto bargain with that sort of a woman. I disturbed her at her devotions\r\nthat morning. But glad to communicate with the outside world. Our\r\ngreat day, she said. Feast of Our Lady of Mount Carmel. Sweet name too:\r\ncaramel. She knew I, I think she knew by the way she. If she had married\r\nshe would have changed. I suppose they really were short of money. Fried\r\neverything in the best butter all the same. No lard for them. My heart\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbroke eating dripping. They like buttering themselves in and out. Molly\r\ntasting it, her veil up. Sister? Pat Claffey, the pawnbroker\xe2\x80\x99s daughter.\r\nIt was a nun they say invented barbed wire.\r\n\r\nHe crossed Westmoreland street when apostrophe S had plodded by. Rover\r\ncycleshop. Those races are on today. How long ago is that? Year Phil\r\nGilligan died. We were in Lombard street west. Wait: was in Thom\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\nGot the job in Wisdom Hely\xe2\x80\x99s year we married. Six years. Ten years ago:\r\nninetyfour he died yes that\xe2\x80\x99s right the big fire at Arnott\xe2\x80\x99s. Val Dillon\r\nwas lord mayor. The Glencree dinner. Alderman Robert O\xe2\x80\x99Reilly emptying\r\nthe port into his soup before the flag fell. Bobbob lapping it for the\r\ninner alderman. Couldn\xe2\x80\x99t hear what the band played. For what we have\r\nalready received may the Lord make us. Milly was a kiddy then. Molly\r\nhad that elephantgrey dress with the braided frogs. Mantailored with\r\nselfcovered buttons. She didn\xe2\x80\x99t like it because I sprained my ankle\r\nfirst day she wore choir picnic at the Sugarloaf. As if that. Old\r\nGoodwin\xe2\x80\x99s tall hat done up with some sticky stuff. Flies\xe2\x80\x99 picnic\r\ntoo. Never put a dress on her back like it. Fitted her like a glove,\r\nshoulders and hips. Just beginning to plump it out well. Rabbitpie we\r\nhad that day. People looking after her.\r\n\r\nHappy. Happier then. Snug little room that was with the red wallpaper.\r\nDockrell\xe2\x80\x99s, one and ninepence a dozen. Milly\xe2\x80\x99s tubbing night. American\r\nsoap I bought: elderflower. Cosy smell of her bathwater. Funny she\r\nlooked soaped all over. Shapely too. Now photography. Poor papa\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndaguerreotype atelier he told me of. Hereditary taste.\r\n\r\nHe walked along the curbstone.\r\n\r\nStream of life. What was the name of that priestylooking chap was always\r\nsquinting in when he passed? Weak eyes, woman. Stopped in Citron\xe2\x80\x99s saint\r\nKevin\xe2\x80\x99s parade. Pen something. Pendennis? My memory is getting. Pen\r\n...? Of course it\xe2\x80\x99s years ago. Noise of the trams probably. Well, if he\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t remember the dayfather\xe2\x80\x99s name that he sees every day.\r\n\r\nBartell d\xe2\x80\x99Arcy was the tenor, just coming out then. Seeing her home\r\nafter practice. Conceited fellow with his waxedup moustache. Gave her\r\nthat song Winds that blow from the south.\r\n\r\nWindy night that was I went to fetch her there was that lodge meeting on\r\nabout those lottery tickets after Goodwin\xe2\x80\x99s concert in the supperroom or\r\noakroom of the Mansion house. He and I behind. Sheet of her music blew\r\nout of my hand against the High school railings. Lucky it didn\xe2\x80\x99t.\r\nThing like that spoils the effect of a night for her. Professor Goodwin\r\nlinking her in front. Shaky on his pins, poor old sot. His farewell\r\nconcerts. Positively last appearance on any stage. May be for months and\r\nmay be for never. Remember her laughing at the wind, her blizzard collar\r\nup. Corner of Harcourt road remember that gust. Brrfoo! Blew up all her\r\nskirts and her boa nearly smothered old Goodwin. She did get flushed\r\nin the wind. Remember when we got home raking up the fire and frying up\r\nthose pieces of lap of mutton for her supper with the Chutney sauce she\r\nliked. And the mulled rum. Could see her in the bedroom from the hearth\r\nunclamping the busk of her stays: white.\r\n\r\nSwish and soft flop her stays made on the bed. Always warm from her.\r\nAlways liked to let her self out. Sitting there after till near two\r\ntaking out her hairpins. Milly tucked up in beddyhouse. Happy. Happy.\r\nThat was the night...\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94O, Mr Bloom, how do you do?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94O, how do you do, Mrs Breen?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94No use complaining. How is Molly those times? Haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen her for\r\nages.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94In the pink, Mr Bloom said gaily. Milly has a position down in\r\nMullingar, you know.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Go away! Isn\xe2\x80\x99t that grand for her?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Yes. In a photographer\xe2\x80\x99s there. Getting on like a house on fire. How\r\nare all your charges?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94All on the baker\xe2\x80\x99s list, Mrs Breen said.\r\n\r\nHow many has she? No other in sight.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94You\xe2\x80\x99re in black, I see. You have no...\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94No, Mr Bloom said. I have just come from a funeral.\r\n\r\nGoing to crop up all day, I foresee. Who\xe2\x80\x99s dead, when and what did he\r\ndie of? Turn up like a bad penny.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94O, dear me, Mrs Breen said. I hope it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t any near relation.\r\n\r\nMay as well get her sympathy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Dignam, Mr Bloom said. An old friend of mine. He died quite suddenly,\r\npoor fellow. Heart trouble, I believe. Funeral was this morning.\r\n\r\n      Your funeral\xe2\x80\x99s tomorrow\r\n      While you\xe2\x80\x99re coming through the rye.\r\n      Diddlediddle dumdum\r\n      Diddlediddle...\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Sad to lose the old friends, Mrs Breen\xe2\x80\x99s womaneyes said melancholily.\r\n\r\nNow that\xe2\x80\x99s quite enough about that. Just: quietly: husband.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94And your lord and master?\r\n\r\nMrs Breen turned up her two large eyes. Hasn\xe2\x80\x99t lost them anyhow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94O, don\xe2\x80\x99t be talking! she said. He\xe2\x80\x99s a caution to rattlesnakes. He\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nin there now with his lawbooks finding out the law of libel. He has me\r\nheartscalded. Wait till I show you.\r\n\r\nHot mockturtle vapour and steam of newbaked jampuffs rolypoly poured\r\nout from Harrison\xe2\x80\x99s. The heavy noonreek tickled the top of Mr Bloom\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngullet. Want to make good pastry, butter, best flour, Demerara sugar,\r\nor they\xe2\x80\x99d taste it with the hot tea. Or is it from her? A barefoot\r\narab stood over the grating, breathing in the fumes. Deaden the gnaw of\r\nhunger that way. Pleasure or pain is it? Penny dinner. Knife and fork\r\nchained to the table.\r\n\r\nOpening her handbag, chipped leather. Hatpin: ought to have a guard on\r\nthose things. Stick it in a chap\xe2\x80\x99s eye in the tram. Rummaging. Open.\r\nMoney. Please take one. Devils if they lose sixpence. Raise Cain.\r\nHusband barging. Where\xe2\x80\x99s the ten shillings I gave you on Monday? Are\r\nyou feeding your little brother\xe2\x80\x99s family? Soiled handkerchief:\r\nmedicinebottle. Pastille that was fell. What is she?...\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94There must be a new moon out, she said. He\xe2\x80\x99s always bad then. Do you\r\nknow what he did last night?\r\n\r\nHer hand ceased to rummage. Her eyes fixed themselves on him, wide in\r\nalarm, yet smiling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94What? Mr Bloom asked.\r\n\r\nLet her speak. Look straight in her eyes. I believe you. Trust me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Woke me up in the night, she said. Dream he had, a nightmare.\r\n\r\nIndiges.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Said the ace of spades was walking up the stairs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94The ace of spades! Mr Bloom said.\r\n\r\nShe took a folded postcard from her handbag.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Read that, she said. He got it this morning.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94What is it? Mr Bloom asked, taking the card. U.P.?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94U.P.: up, she said. Someone taking a rise out of him. It\xe2\x80\x99s a great\r\nshame for them whoever he is.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Indeed it is, Mr Bloom said.\r\n\r\nShe took back the card, sighing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94And now he\xe2\x80\x99s going round to Mr Menton\xe2\x80\x99s office. He\xe2\x80\x99s going to take an\r\naction for ten thousand pounds, he says.\r\n\r\nShe folded the card into her untidy bag and snapped the catch.\r\n\r\nSame blue serge dress she had two years ago, the nap bleaching. Seen its\r\nbest days. Wispish hair over her ears. And that dowdy toque: three old\r\ngrapes to take the harm out of it. Shabby genteel. She used to be a\r\ntasty dresser. Lines round her mouth. Only a year or so older than\r\nMolly.\r\n\r\nSee the eye that woman gave her, passing. Cruel. The unfair sex.\r\n\r\nHe looked still at her, holding back behind his look his discontent.\r\nPungent mockturtle oxtail mulligatawny. I\xe2\x80\x99m hungry too. Flakes of pastry\r\non the gusset of her dress: daub of sugary flour stuck to her cheek.\r\nRhubarb tart with liberal fillings, rich fruit interior. Josie Powell\r\nthat was. In Luke Doyle\xe2\x80\x99s long ago. Dolphin\xe2\x80\x99s Barn, the charades. U.P.:\r\nup.\r\n\r\nChange the subject.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Do you ever see anything of Mrs Beaufoy? Mr Bloom asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Mina Purefoy? she said.\r\n\r\nPhilip Beaufoy I was thinking. Playgoers\xe2\x80\x99 Club. Matcham often thinks of\r\nthe masterstroke. Did I pull the chain? Yes. The last act.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Yes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I just called to ask on the way in is she over it. She\xe2\x80\x99s in the\r\nlying-in hospital in Holles street. Dr Horne got her in. She\xe2\x80\x99s three\r\ndays bad now.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94O, Mr Bloom said. I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry to hear that.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Yes, Mrs Breen said. And a houseful of kids at home. It\xe2\x80\x99s a very stiff\r\nbirth, the nurse told me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94O, Mr Bloom said.\r\n\r\nHis heavy pitying gaze absorbed her news. His tongue clacked in\r\ncompassion. Dth! Dth!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry to hear that, he said. Poor thing! Three days! That\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nterrible for her.\r\n\r\nMrs Breen nodded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94She was taken bad on the Tuesday...\r\n\r\nMr Bloom touched her funnybone gently, warning her:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Mind! Let this man pass.\r\n\r\nA bony form strode along the curbstone from the river staring with a\r\nrapt gaze into the sunlight through a heavystringed glass. Tight as a\r\nskullpiece a tiny hat gripped his head. From his arm a folded dustcoat,\r\na stick and an umbrella dangled to his stride.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Watch him, Mr Bloom said. He always walks outside the lampposts. Watch!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Who is he if it\xe2\x80\x99s a fair question? Mrs Breen asked. Is he dotty?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94His name is Cashel Boyle O\xe2\x80\x99Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell, Mr Bloom\r\nsaid smiling. Watch!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94He has enough of them, she said. Denis will be like that one of these\r\ndays.\r\n\r\nShe broke off suddenly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94There he is, she said. I must go after him. Goodbye. Remember me to\r\nMolly, won\xe2\x80\x99t you?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I will, Mr Bloom said.\r\n\r\nHe watched her dodge through passers towards the shopfronts. Denis Breen\r\nin skimpy frockcoat and blue canvas shoes shuffled out of Harrison\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhugging two heavy tomes to his ribs. Blown in from the bay. Like old\r\ntimes. He suffered her to overtake him without surprise and thrust\r\nhis dull grey beard towards her, his loose jaw wagging as he spoke\r\nearnestly.\r\n\r\nMeshuggah. Off his chump.\r\n\r\nMr Bloom walked on again easily, seeing ahead of him in sunlight the\r\ntight skullpiece, the dangling stickumbrelladustcoat. Going the two\r\ndays. Watch him! Out he goes again. One way of getting on in the world.\r\nAnd that other old mosey lunatic in those duds. Hard time she must have\r\nwith him.\r\n\r\nU.P.: up. I\xe2\x80\x99ll take my oath that\xe2\x80\x99s Alf Bergan or Richie Goulding. Wrote\r\nit for a lark in the Scotch house I bet anything. Round to Menton\xe2\x80\x99s\r\noffice. His oyster eyes staring at the postcard. Be a feast for the\r\ngods.\r\n\r\nHe passed the Irish Times. There might be other answers Iying there.\r\nLike to answer them all. Good system for criminals. Code. At their lunch\r\nnow. Clerk with the glasses there doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know me. O, leave them there\r\nto simmer. Enough bother wading through fortyfour of them. Wanted, smart\r\nlady typist to aid gentleman in literary work. I called you naughty\r\ndarling because I do not like that other world. Please tell me what is\r\nthe meaning. Please tell me what perfume does your wife. Tell me who\r\nmade the world. The way they spring those questions on you. And the\r\nother one Lizzie Twigg. My literary efforts have had the good fortune to\r\nmeet with the approval of the eminent poet A. E. (Mr Geo. Russell). No\r\ntime to do her hair drinking sloppy tea with a book of poetry.\r\n\r\nBest paper by long chalks for a small ad. Got the provinces now. Cook\r\nand general, exc. cuisine, housemaid kept. Wanted live man for spirit\r\ncounter. Resp. girl (R.C.) wishes to hear of post in fruit or pork shop.\r\nJames Carlisle made that. Six and a half per cent dividend. Made a big\r\ndeal on Coates\xe2\x80\x99s shares. Ca\xe2\x80\x99 canny. Cunning old Scotch hunks. All the\r\ntoady news. Our gracious and popular vicereine. Bought the Irish Field\r\nnow. Lady Mountcashel has quite recovered after her confinement and\r\nrode out with the Ward Union staghounds at the enlargement yesterday\r\nat Rathoath. Uneatable fox. Pothunters too. Fear injects juices make\r\nit tender enough for them. Riding astride. Sit her horse like a man.\r\nWeightcarrying huntress. No sidesaddle or pillion for her, not for Joe.\r\nFirst to the meet and in at the death. Strong as a brood mare some of\r\nthose horsey women. Swagger around livery stables. Toss off a glass\r\nof brandy neat while you\xe2\x80\x99d say knife. That one at the Grosvenor this\r\nmorning. Up with her on the car: wishswish. Stonewall or fivebarred gate\r\nput her mount to it. Think that pugnosed driver did it out of spite. Who\r\nis this she was like? O yes! Mrs Miriam Dandrade that sold me her old\r\nwraps and black underclothes in the Shelbourne hotel. Divorced Spanish\r\nAmerican. Didn\xe2\x80\x99t take a feather out of her my handling them. As if I was\r\nher clotheshorse. Saw her in the viceregal party when Stubbs the park\r\nranger got me in with Whelan of the Express. Scavenging what the\r\nquality left. High tea. Mayonnaise I poured on the plums thinking it was\r\ncustard. Her ears ought to have tingled for a few weeks after. Want to\r\nbe a bull for her. Born courtesan. No nursery work for her, thanks.\r\n\r\nPoor Mrs Purefoy! Methodist husband. Method in his madness. Saffron bun\r\nand milk and soda lunch in the educational dairy. Y. M. C. A. Eating\r\nwith a stopwatch, thirtytwo chews to the minute. And still his\r\nmuttonchop whiskers grew. Supposed to be well connected. Theodore\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncousin in Dublin Castle. One tony relative in every family. Hardy\r\nannuals he presents her with. Saw him out at the Three Jolly Topers\r\nmarching along bareheaded and his eldest boy carrying one in a\r\nmarketnet. The squallers. Poor thing! Then having to give the breast\r\nyear after year all hours of the night. Selfish those t.t\xe2\x80\x99s are. Dog in\r\nthe manger. Only one lump of sugar in my tea, if you please.\r\n\r\nHe stood at Fleet street crossing. Luncheon interval. A sixpenny at\r\nRowe\xe2\x80\x99s? Must look up that ad in the national library. An eightpenny in\r\nthe Burton. Better. On my way.\r\n\r\nHe walked on past Bolton\xe2\x80\x99s Westmoreland house. Tea. Tea. Tea. I forgot\r\nto tap Tom Kernan.\r\n\r\nSss. Dth, dth, dth! Three days imagine groaning on a bed with a\r\nvinegared handkerchief round her forehead, her belly swollen out. Phew!\r\nDreadful simply! Child\xe2\x80\x99s head too big: forceps. Doubled up inside her\r\ntrying to butt its way out blindly, groping for the way out. Kill me\r\nthat would. Lucky Molly got over hers lightly. They ought to invent\r\nsomething to stop that. Life with hard labour. Twilight sleep idea:\r\nqueen Victoria was given that. Nine she had. A good layer. Old\r\nwoman that lived in a shoe she had so many children. Suppose he was\r\nconsumptive. Time someone thought about it instead of gassing about the\r\nwhat was it the pensive bosom of the silver effulgence. Flapdoodle to\r\nfeed fools on. They could easily have big establishments whole thing\r\nquite painless out of all the taxes give every child born five quid at\r\ncompound interest up to twentyone five per cent is a hundred shillings\r\nand five tiresome pounds multiply by twenty decimal system encourage\r\npeople to put by money save hundred and ten and a bit twentyone years\r\nwant to work it out on paper come to a tidy sum more than you think.\r\n\r\nNot stillborn of course. They are not even registered. Trouble for\r\nnothing.\r\n\r\nFunny sight two of them together, their bellies out. Molly and Mrs\r\nMoisel. Mothers\xe2\x80\x99 meeting. Phthisis retires for the time being, then\r\nreturns. How flat they look all of a sudden after. Peaceful eyes. Weight\r\noff their mind. Old Mrs Thornton was a jolly old soul. All my babies,\r\nshe said. The spoon of pap in her mouth before she fed them. O, that\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nnyumnyum. Got her hand crushed by old Tom Wall\xe2\x80\x99s son. His first bow to\r\nthe public. Head like a prize pumpkin. Snuffy Dr Murren. People knocking\r\nthem up at all hours. For God\xe2\x80\x99 sake, doctor. Wife in her throes. Then\r\nkeep them waiting months for their fee. To attendance on your wife. No\r\ngratitude in people. Humane doctors, most of them.\r\n\r\nBefore the huge high door of the Irish house of parliament a flock of\r\npigeons flew. Their little frolic after meals. Who will we do it on? I\r\npick the fellow in black. Here goes. Here\xe2\x80\x99s good luck. Must be thrilling\r\nfrom the air. Apjohn, myself and Owen Goldberg up in the trees near\r\nGoose green playing the monkeys. Mackerel they called me.\r\n\r\nA squad of constables debouched from College street, marching in Indian\r\nfile. Goosestep. Foodheated faces, sweating helmets, patting their\r\ntruncheons. After their feed with a good load of fat soup under their\r\nbelts. Policeman\xe2\x80\x99s lot is oft a happy one. They split up in groups and\r\nscattered, saluting, towards their beats. Let out to graze. Best moment\r\nto attack one in pudding time. A punch in his dinner. A squad of others,\r\nmarching irregularly, rounded Trinity railings making for the station.\r\nBound for their troughs. Prepare to receive cavalry. Prepare to receive\r\nsoup.\r\n\r\nHe crossed under Tommy Moore\xe2\x80\x99s roguish finger. They did right to put him\r\nup over a urinal: meeting of the waters. Ought to be places for women.\r\nRunning into cakeshops. Settle my hat straight. There is not in this\r\nwide world a vallee. Great song of Julia Morkan\xe2\x80\x99s. Kept her voice up to\r\nthe very last. Pupil of Michael Balfe\xe2\x80\x99s, wasn\xe2\x80\x99t she?\r\n\r\nHe gazed after the last broad tunic. Nasty customers to tackle. Jack\r\nPower could a tale unfold: father a G man. If a fellow gave them trouble\r\nbeing lagged they let him have it hot and heavy in the bridewell.\r\nCan\xe2\x80\x99t blame them after all with the job they have especially the young\r\nhornies. That horsepoliceman the day Joe Chamberlain was given his\r\ndegree in Trinity he got a run for his money. My word he did! His\r\nhorse\xe2\x80\x99s hoofs clattering after us down Abbey street. Lucky I had the\r\npresence of mind to dive into Manning\xe2\x80\x99s or I was souped. He did come a\r\nwallop, by George. Must have cracked his skull on the cobblestones. I\r\noughtn\xe2\x80\x99t to have got myself swept along with those medicals. And the\r\nTrinity jibs in their mortarboards. Looking for trouble. Still I got to\r\nknow that young Dixon who dressed that sting for me in the Mater and now\r\nhe\xe2\x80\x99s in Holles street where Mrs Purefoy. Wheels within wheels. Police\r\nwhistle in my ears still. All skedaddled. Why he fixed on me. Give me in\r\ncharge. Right here it began.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Up the Boers!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Three cheers for De Wet!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94We\xe2\x80\x99ll hang Joe Chamberlain on a sourapple tree.\r\n\r\nSilly billies: mob of young cubs yelling their guts out. Vinegar hill.\r\nThe Butter exchange band. Few years\xe2\x80\x99 time half of them magistrates and\r\ncivil servants. War comes on: into the army helterskelter: same fellows\r\nused to. Whether on the scaffold high.\r\n\r\nNever know who you\xe2\x80\x99re talking to. Corny Kelleher he has Harvey Duff in\r\nhis eye. Like that Peter or Denis or James Carey that blew the gaff on\r\nthe invincibles. Member of the corporation too. Egging raw youths on to\r\nget in the know all the time drawing secret service pay from the castle.\r\nDrop him like a hot potato. Why those plainclothes men are always\r\ncourting slaveys. Easily twig a man used to uniform. Squarepushing up\r\nagainst a backdoor. Maul her a bit. Then the next thing on the menu. And\r\nwho is the gentleman does be visiting there? Was the young master saying\r\nanything? Peeping Tom through the keyhole. Decoy duck. Hotblooded young\r\nstudent fooling round her fat arms ironing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Are those yours, Mary?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I don\xe2\x80\x99t wear such things... Stop or I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell the missus on you. Out\r\nhalf the night.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94There are great times coming, Mary. Wait till you see.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Ah, gelong with your great times coming.\r\n\r\nBarmaids too. Tobaccoshopgirls.\r\n\r\nJames Stephens\xe2\x80\x99 idea was the best. He knew them. Circles of ten so that\r\na fellow couldn\xe2\x80\x99t round on more than his own ring. Sinn Fein. Back out\r\nyou get the knife. Hidden hand. Stay in. The firing squad. Turnkey\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndaughter got him out of Richmond, off from Lusk. Putting up in the\r\nBuckingham Palace hotel under their very noses. Garibaldi.\r\n\r\nYou must have a certain fascination: Parnell. Arthur Griffith is a\r\nsquareheaded fellow but he has no go in him for the mob. Or gas about\r\nour lovely land. Gammon and spinach. Dublin Bakery Company\xe2\x80\x99s tearoom.\r\nDebating societies. That republicanism is the best form of government.\r\nThat the language question should take precedence of the economic\r\nquestion. Have your daughters inveigling them to your house. Stuff them\r\nup with meat and drink. Michaelmas goose. Here\xe2\x80\x99s a good lump of thyme\r\nseasoning under the apron for you. Have another quart of goosegrease\r\nbefore it gets too cold. Halffed enthusiasts. Penny roll and a walk with\r\nthe band. No grace for the carver. The thought that the other chap pays\r\nbest sauce in the world. Make themselves thoroughly at home. Show us\r\nover those apricots, meaning peaches. The not far distant day. Homerule\r\nsun rising up in the northwest.\r\n\r\nHis smile faded as he walked, a heavy cloud hiding the sun slowly,\r\nshadowing Trinity\xe2\x80\x99s surly front. Trams passed one another, ingoing,\r\noutgoing, clanging. Useless words. Things go on same, day after day:\r\nsquads of police marching out, back: trams in, out. Those two loonies\r\nmooching about. Dignam carted off. Mina Purefoy swollen belly on a\r\nbed groaning to have a child tugged out of her. One born every second\r\nsomewhere. Other dying every second. Since I fed the birds five minutes.\r\nThree hundred kicked the bucket. Other three hundred born, washing the\r\nblood off, all are washed in the blood of the lamb, bawling maaaaaa.\r\n\r\nCityful passing away, other cityful coming, passing away too: other\r\ncoming on, passing on. Houses, lines of houses, streets, miles of\r\npavements, piledup bricks, stones. Changing hands. This owner, that.\r\nLandlord never dies they say. Other steps into his shoes when he gets\r\nhis notice to quit. They buy the place up with gold and still they have\r\nall the gold. Swindle in it somewhere. Piled up in cities, worn away age\r\nafter age. Pyramids in sand. Built on bread and onions. Slaves Chinese\r\nwall. Babylon. Big stones left. Round towers. Rest rubble, sprawling\r\nsuburbs, jerrybuilt. Kerwan\xe2\x80\x99s mushroom houses built of breeze. Shelter,\r\nfor the night.\r\n\r\nNo-one is anything.\r\n\r\nThis is the very worst hour of the day. Vitality. Dull, gloomy: hate\r\nthis hour. Feel as if I had been eaten and spewed.\r\n\r\nProvost\xe2\x80\x99s house. The reverend Dr Salmon: tinned salmon. Well tinned in\r\nthere. Like a mortuary chapel. Wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t live in it if they paid me. Hope\r\nthey have liver and bacon today. Nature abhors a vacuum.\r\n\r\nThe sun freed itself slowly and lit glints of light among the silverware\r\nopposite in Walter Sexton\xe2\x80\x99s window by which John Howard Parnell passed,\r\nunseeing.\r\n\r\nThere he is: the brother. Image of him. Haunting face. Now that\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\ncoincidence. Course hundreds of times you think of a person and don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nmeet him. Like a man walking in his sleep. No-one knows him. Must be a\r\ncorporation meeting today. They say he never put on the city marshal\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nuniform since he got the job. Charley Kavanagh used to come out on\r\nhis high horse, cocked hat, puffed, powdered and shaved. Look at the\r\nwoebegone walk of him. Eaten a bad egg. Poached eyes on ghost. I have a\r\npain. Great man\xe2\x80\x99s brother: his brother\xe2\x80\x99s brother. He\xe2\x80\x99d look nice on the\r\ncity charger. Drop into the D.B.C. probably for his coffee, play chess\r\nthere. His brother used men as pawns. Let them all go to pot. Afraid to\r\npass a remark on him. Freeze them up with that eye of his. That\xe2\x80\x99s the\r\nfascination: the name. All a bit touched. Mad Fanny and his other sister\r\nMrs Dickinson driving about with scarlet harness. Bolt upright like\r\nsurgeon M\xe2\x80\x99Ardle. Still David Sheehy beat him for south Meath. Apply\r\nfor the Chiltern Hundreds and retire into public life. The patriot\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbanquet. Eating orangepeels in the park. Simon Dedalus said when they\r\nput him in parliament that Parnell would come back from the grave and\r\nlead him out of the house of commons by the arm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Of the twoheaded octopus, one of whose heads is the head upon which the\r\nends of the world have forgotten to come while the other speaks with a\r\nScotch accent. The tentacles...\r\n\r\nThey passed from behind Mr Bloom along the curbstone. Beard and bicycle.\r\nYoung woman.\r\n\r\nAnd there he is too. Now that\xe2\x80\x99s really a coincidence: second time.\r\nComing events cast their shadows before. With the approval of the\r\neminent poet, Mr Geo. Russell. That might be Lizzie Twigg with him. A.\r\nE.: what does that mean? Initials perhaps. Albert Edward, Arthur Edmund,\r\nAlphonsus Eb Ed El Esquire. What was he saying? The ends of the world\r\nwith a Scotch accent. Tentacles: octopus. Something occult: symbolism.\r\nHolding forth. She\xe2\x80\x99s taking it all in. Not saying a word. To aid\r\ngentleman in literary work.\r\n\r\nHis eyes followed the high figure in homespun, beard and bicycle,\r\na listening woman at his side. Coming from the vegetarian. Only\r\nweggebobbles and fruit. Don\xe2\x80\x99t eat a beefsteak. If you do the eyes of\r\nthat cow will pursue you through all eternity. They say it\xe2\x80\x99s healthier.\r\nWindandwatery though. Tried it. Keep you on the run all day. Bad as\r\na bloater. Dreams all night. Why do they call that thing they gave me\r\nnutsteak? Nutarians. Fruitarians. To give you the idea you are eating\r\nrumpsteak. Absurd. Salty too. They cook in soda. Keep you sitting by the\r\ntap all night.\r\n\r\nHer stockings are loose over her ankles. I detest that: so tasteless.\r\nThose literary etherial people they are all. Dreamy, cloudy,\r\nsymbolistic. Esthetes they are. I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be surprised if it was that\r\nkind of food you see produces the like waves of the brain the poetical.\r\nFor example one of those policemen sweating Irish stew into their shirts\r\nyou couldn\xe2\x80\x99t squeeze a line of poetry out of him. Don\xe2\x80\x99t know what poetry\r\nis even. Must be in a certain mood.\r\n\r\n     The dreamy cloudy gull\r\n     Waves o\xe2\x80\x99er the waters dull.\r\n\r\nHe crossed at Nassau street corner and stood before the window of Yeates\r\nand Son, pricing the fieldglasses. Or will I drop into old Harris\xe2\x80\x99s and\r\nhave a chat with young Sinclair? Wellmannered fellow. Probably at his\r\nlunch. Must get those old glasses of mine set right. Goerz lenses six\r\nguineas. Germans making their way everywhere. Sell on easy terms to\r\ncapture trade. Undercutting. Might chance on a pair in the railway lost\r\nproperty office. Astonishing the things people leave behind them in\r\ntrains and cloakrooms. What do they be thinking about? Women too.\r\nIncredible. Last year travelling to Ennis had to pick up that farmer\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndaughter\xe2\x80\x99s bag and hand it to her at Limerick junction. Unclaimed money\r\ntoo. There\xe2\x80\x99s a little watch up there on the roof of the bank to test\r\nthose glasses by.\r\n\r\nHis lids came down on the lower rims of his irides. Can\xe2\x80\x99t see it. If you\r\nimagine it\xe2\x80\x99s there you can almost see it. Can\xe2\x80\x99t see it.\r\n\r\nHe faced about and, standing between the awnings, held out his right\r\nhand at arm\xe2\x80\x99s length towards the sun. Wanted to try that often. Yes:\r\ncompletely. The tip of his little finger blotted out the sun\xe2\x80\x99s disk.\r\nMust be the focus where the rays cross. If I had black glasses.\r\nInteresting. There was a lot of talk about those sunspots when we\r\nwere in Lombard street west. Looking up from the back garden. Terrific\r\nexplosions they are. There will be a total eclipse this year: autumn\r\nsome time.\r\n\r\nNow that I come to think of it that ball falls at Greenwich time. It\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nthe clock is worked by an electric wire from Dunsink. Must go out there\r\nsome first Saturday of the month. If I could get an introduction to\r\nprofessor Joly or learn up something about his family. That would do to:\r\nman always feels complimented. Flattery where least expected. Nobleman\r\nproud to be descended from some king\xe2\x80\x99s mistress. His foremother. Lay it\r\non with a trowel. Cap in hand goes through the land. Not go in and blurt\r\nout what you know you\xe2\x80\x99re not to: what\xe2\x80\x99s parallax? Show this gentleman\r\nthe door.\r\n\r\nAh.\r\n\r\nHis hand fell to his side again.\r\n\r\nNever know anything about it. Waste of time. Gasballs spinning about,\r\ncrossing each other, passing. Same old dingdong always. Gas: then solid:\r\nthen world: then cold: then dead shell drifting around, frozen rock,\r\nlike that pineapple rock. The moon. Must be a new moon out, she said. I\r\nbelieve there is.\r\n\r\nHe went on by la maison Claire.\r\n\r\nWait. The full moon was the night we were Sunday fortnight exactly there\r\nis a new moon. Walking down by the Tolka. Not bad for a Fairview moon.\r\nShe was humming. The young May moon she\xe2\x80\x99s beaming, love. He other side\r\nof her. Elbow, arm. He. Glowworm\xe2\x80\x99s la-amp is gleaming, love. Touch.\r\nFingers. Asking. Answer. Yes.\r\n\r\nStop. Stop. If it was it was. Must.\r\n\r\nMr Bloom, quickbreathing, slowlier walking passed Adam court.\r\n\r\nWith a keep quiet relief his eyes took note this is the street here\r\nmiddle of the day of Bob Doran\xe2\x80\x99s bottle shoulders. On his annual bend,\r\nM\xe2\x80\x99Coy said. They drink in order to say or do something or cherchez la\r\nfemme. Up in the Coombe with chummies and streetwalkers and then the\r\nrest of the year sober as a judge.\r\n\r\nYes. Thought so. Sloping into the Empire. Gone. Plain soda would do him\r\ngood. Where Pat Kinsella had his Harp theatre before Whitbred ran the\r\nQueen\xe2\x80\x99s. Broth of a boy. Dion Boucicault business with his harvestmoon\r\nface in a poky bonnet. Three Purty Maids from School. How time flies,\r\neh? Showing long red pantaloons under his skirts. Drinkers, drinking,\r\nlaughed spluttering, their drink against their breath. More power, Pat.\r\nCoarse red: fun for drunkards: guffaw and smoke. Take off that white\r\nhat. His parboiled eyes. Where is he now? Beggar somewhere. The harp\r\nthat once did starve us all.\r\n\r\nI was happier then. Or was that I? Or am I now I? Twentyeight I was. She\r\ntwentythree. When we left Lombard street west something changed. Could\r\nnever like it again after Rudy. Can\xe2\x80\x99t bring back time. Like holding\r\nwater in your hand. Would you go back to then? Just beginning then.\r\nWould you? Are you not happy in your home you poor little naughty boy?\r\nWants to sew on buttons for me. I must answer. Write it in the library.\r\n\r\nGrafton street gay with housed awnings lured his senses. Muslin prints,\r\nsilkdames and dowagers, jingle of harnesses, hoofthuds lowringing in the\r\nbaking causeway. Thick feet that woman has in the white stockings. Hope\r\nthe rain mucks them up on her. Countrybred chawbacon. All the beef to\r\nthe heels were in. Always gives a woman clumsy feet. Molly looks out of\r\nplumb.\r\n\r\nHe passed, dallying, the windows of Brown Thomas, silk mercers. Cascades\r\nof ribbons. Flimsy China silks. A tilted urn poured from its mouth a\r\nflood of bloodhued poplin: lustrous blood. The huguenots brought that\r\nhere. La causa \xc3\xa8 santa! Tara tara. Great chorus that. Taree tara. Must\r\nbe washed in rainwater. Meyerbeer. Tara: bom bom bom.\r\n\r\nPincushions. I\xe2\x80\x99m a long time threatening to buy one. Sticking them all\r\nover the place. Needles in window curtains.\r\n\r\nHe bared slightly his left forearm. Scrape: nearly gone. Not today\r\nanyhow. Must go back for that lotion. For her birthday perhaps.\r\nJunejulyaugseptember eighth. Nearly three months off. Then she mightn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nlike it. Women won\xe2\x80\x99t pick up pins. Say it cuts lo.\r\n\r\nGleaming silks, petticoats on slim brass rails, rays of flat silk\r\nstockings.\r\n\r\nUseless to go back. Had to be. Tell me all.\r\n\r\nHigh voices. Sunwarm silk. Jingling harnesses. All for a woman, home and\r\nhouses, silkwebs, silver, rich fruits spicy from Jaffa. Agendath Netaim.\r\nWealth of the world.\r\n\r\nA warm human plumpness settled down on his brain. His brain yielded.\r\nPerfume of embraces all him assailed. With hungered flesh obscurely, he\r\nmutely craved to adore.\r\n\r\nDuke street. Here we are. Must eat. The Burton. Feel better then.\r\n\r\nHe turned Combridge\xe2\x80\x99s corner, still pursued. Jingling, hoofthuds.\r\nPerfumed bodies, warm, full. All kissed, yielded: in deep summer fields,\r\ntangled pressed grass, in trickling hallways of tenements, along sofas,\r\ncreaking beds.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Jack, love!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Darling!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Kiss me, Reggy!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94My boy!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Love!\r\n\r\nHis heart astir he pushed in the door of the Burton restaurant. Stink\r\ngripped his trembling breath: pungent meatjuice, slush of greens. See\r\nthe animals feed.\r\n\r\nMen, men, men.\r\n\r\nPerched on high stools by the bar, hats shoved back, at the tables\r\ncalling for more bread no charge, swilling, wolfing gobfuls of sloppy\r\nfood, their eyes bulging, wiping wetted moustaches. A pallid suetfaced\r\nyoung man polished his tumbler knife fork and spoon with his napkin. New\r\nset of microbes. A man with an infant\xe2\x80\x99s saucestained napkin tucked round\r\nhim shovelled gurgling soup down his gullet. A man spitting back on his\r\nplate: halfmasticated gristle: gums: no teeth to chewchewchew it. Chump\r\nchop from the grill. Bolting to get it over. Sad booser\xe2\x80\x99s eyes. Bitten\r\noff more than he can chew. Am I like that? See ourselves as others see\r\nus. Hungry man is an angry man. Working tooth and jaw. Don\xe2\x80\x99t! O! A bone!\r\nThat last pagan king of Ireland Cormac in the schoolpoem choked himself\r\nat Sletty southward of the Boyne. Wonder what he was eating. Something\r\ngaloptious. Saint Patrick converted him to Christianity. Couldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nswallow it all however.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Roast beef and cabbage.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94One stew.\r\n\r\nSmells of men. Spat-on sawdust, sweetish warmish cigarettesmoke, reek of\r\nplug, spilt beer, men\xe2\x80\x99s beery piss, the stale of ferment.\r\n\r\nHis gorge rose.\r\n\r\nCouldn\xe2\x80\x99t eat a morsel here. Fellow sharpening knife and fork to eat all\r\nbefore him, old chap picking his tootles. Slight spasm, full, chewing\r\nthe cud. Before and after. Grace after meals. Look on this picture then\r\non that. Scoffing up stewgravy with sopping sippets of bread. Lick it\r\noff the plate, man! Get out of this.\r\n\r\nHe gazed round the stooled and tabled eaters, tightening the wings of\r\nhis nose.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Two stouts here.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94One corned and cabbage.\r\n\r\nThat fellow ramming a knifeful of cabbage down as if his life depended\r\non it. Good stroke. Give me the fidgets to look. Safer to eat from his\r\nthree hands. Tear it limb from limb. Second nature to him. Born with a\r\nsilver knife in his mouth. That\xe2\x80\x99s witty, I think. Or no. Silver means\r\nborn rich. Born with a knife. But then the allusion is lost.\r\n\r\nAn illgirt server gathered sticky clattering plates. Rock, the head\r\nbailiff, standing at the bar blew the foamy crown from his tankard. Well\r\nup: it splashed yellow near his boot. A diner, knife and fork upright,\r\nelbows on table, ready for a second helping stared towards the foodlift\r\nacross his stained square of newspaper. Other chap telling him something\r\nwith his mouth full. Sympathetic listener. Table talk. I munched hum un\r\nthu Unchster Bunk un Munchday. Ha? Did you, faith?\r\n\r\nMr Bloom raised two fingers doubtfully to his lips. His eyes said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Not here. Don\xe2\x80\x99t see him.\r\n\r\nOut. I hate dirty eaters.\r\n\r\nHe backed towards the door. Get a light snack in Davy Byrne\xe2\x80\x99s. Stopgap.\r\nKeep me going. Had a good breakfast.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Roast and mashed here.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Pint of stout.\r\n\r\nEvery fellow for his own, tooth and nail. Gulp. Grub. Gulp. Gobstuff.\r\n\r\nHe came out into clearer air and turned back towards Grafton street. Eat\r\nor be eaten. Kill! Kill!\r\n\r\nSuppose that communal kitchen years to come perhaps. All trotting down\r\nwith porringers and tommycans to be filled. Devour contents in the\r\nstreet. John Howard Parnell example the provost of Trinity every\r\nmother\xe2\x80\x99s son don\xe2\x80\x99t talk of your provosts and provost of Trinity women\r\nand children cabmen priests parsons fieldmarshals archbishops. From\r\nAilesbury road, Clyde road, artisans\xe2\x80\x99 dwellings, north Dublin union,\r\nlord mayor in his gingerbread coach, old queen in a bathchair. My\r\nplate\xe2\x80\x99s empty. After you with our incorporated drinkingcup. Like sir\r\nPhilip Crampton\xe2\x80\x99s fountain. Rub off the microbes with your handkerchief.\r\nNext chap rubs on a new batch with his. Father O\xe2\x80\x99Flynn would make\r\nhares of them all. Have rows all the same. All for number one. Children\r\nfighting for the scrapings of the pot. Want a souppot as big as the\r\nPhoenix park. Harpooning flitches and hindquarters out of it. Hate\r\npeople all round you. City Arms hotel table d\xe2\x80\x99h\xc3\xb4te she called it. Soup,\r\njoint and sweet. Never know whose thoughts you\xe2\x80\x99re chewing. Then who\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nwash up all the plates and forks? Might be all feeding on tabloids that\r\ntime. Teeth getting worse and worse.\r\n\r\nAfter all there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot in that vegetarian fine flavour of things from\r\nthe earth garlic of course it stinks after Italian organgrinders crisp\r\nof onions mushrooms truffles. Pain to the animal too. Pluck and draw\r\nfowl. Wretched brutes there at the cattlemarket waiting for the poleaxe\r\nto split their skulls open. Moo. Poor trembling calves. Meh. Staggering\r\nbob. Bubble and squeak. Butchers\xe2\x80\x99 buckets wobbly lights. Give us that\r\nbrisket off the hook. Plup. Rawhead and bloody bones. Flayed glasseyed\r\nsheep hung from their haunches, sheepsnouts bloodypapered snivelling\r\nnosejam on sawdust. Top and lashers going out. Don\xe2\x80\x99t maul them pieces,\r\nyoung one.\r\n\r\nHot fresh blood they prescribe for decline. Blood always needed.\r\nInsidious. Lick it up smokinghot, thick sugary. Famished ghosts.\r\n\r\nAh, I\xe2\x80\x99m hungry.\r\n\r\nHe entered Davy Byrne\xe2\x80\x99s. Moral pub. He doesn\xe2\x80\x99t chat. Stands a drink now\r\nand then. But in leapyear once in four. Cashed a cheque for me once.\r\n\r\nWhat will I take now? He drew his watch. Let me see now. Shandygaff?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Hello, Bloom, Nosey Flynn said from his nook.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Hello, Flynn.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94How\xe2\x80\x99s things?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Tiptop... Let me see. I\xe2\x80\x99ll take a glass of burgundy and... let me see.\r\n\r\nSardines on the shelves. Almost taste them by looking. Sandwich? Ham\r\nand his descendants musterred and bred there. Potted meats. What is home\r\nwithout Plumtree\xe2\x80\x99s potted meat? Incomplete. What a stupid ad! Under the\r\nobituary notices they stuck it. All up a plumtree. Dignam\xe2\x80\x99s potted meat.\r\nCannibals would with lemon and rice. White missionary too salty. Like\r\npickled pork. Expect the chief consumes the parts of honour. Ought to be\r\ntough from exercise. His wives in a row to watch the effect. There was\r\na right royal old nigger. Who ate or something the somethings of the\r\nreverend Mr MacTrigger. With it an abode of bliss. Lord knows what\r\nconcoction. Cauls mouldy tripes windpipes faked and minced up. Puzzle\r\nfind the meat. Kosher. No meat and milk together. Hygiene that was what\r\nthey call now. Yom Kippur fast spring cleaning of inside. Peace and\r\nwar depend on some fellow\xe2\x80\x99s digestion. Religions. Christmas turkeys and\r\ngeese. Slaughter of innocents. Eat drink and be merry. Then casual wards\r\nfull after. Heads bandaged. Cheese digests all but itself. Mity cheese.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Have you a cheese sandwich?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nLike a few olives too if they had them. Italian I prefer. Good glass of\r\nburgundy take away that. Lubricate. A nice salad, cool as a cucumber,\r\nTom Kernan can dress. Puts gusto into it. Pure olive oil. Milly served\r\nme that cutlet with a sprig of parsley. Take one Spanish onion. God made\r\nfood, the devil the cooks. Devilled crab.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Wife well?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Quite well, thanks... A cheese sandwich, then. Gorgonzola, have you?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nNosey Flynn sipped his grog.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Doing any singing those times?\r\n\r\nLook at his mouth. Could whistle in his own ear. Flap ears to match.\r\nMusic. Knows as much about it as my coachman. Still better tell him.\r\nDoes no harm. Free ad.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94She\xe2\x80\x99s engaged for a big tour end of this month. You may have heard\r\nperhaps.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94No. O, that\xe2\x80\x99s the style. Who\xe2\x80\x99s getting it up?\r\n\r\nThe curate served.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94How much is that?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Seven d., sir... Thank you, sir.\r\n\r\nMr Bloom cut his sandwich into slender strips. Mr MacTrigger. Easier\r\nthan the dreamy creamy stuff. His five hundred wives. Had the time of\r\ntheir lives.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Mustard, sir?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Thank you.\r\n\r\nHe studded under each lifted strip yellow blobs. Their lives. I have it.\r\nIt grew bigger and bigger and bigger.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Getting it up? he said. Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s like a company idea, you see. Part\r\nshares and part profits.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Ay, now I remember, Nosey Flynn said, putting his hand in his pocket to\r\nscratch his groin. Who is this was telling me? Isn\xe2\x80\x99t Blazes Boylan mixed\r\nup in it?\r\n\r\nA warm shock of air heat of mustard hanched on Mr Bloom\xe2\x80\x99s heart. He\r\nraised his eyes and met the stare of a bilious clock. Two. Pub clock\r\nfive minutes fast. Time going on. Hands moving. Two. Not yet.\r\n\r\nHis midriff yearned then upward, sank within him, yearned more longly,\r\nlongingly.\r\n\r\nWine.\r\n\r\nHe smellsipped the cordial juice and, bidding his throat strongly to\r\nspeed it, set his wineglass delicately down.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Yes, he said. He\xe2\x80\x99s the organiser in point of fact.\r\n\r\nNo fear: no brains.\r\n\r\nNosey Flynn snuffled and scratched. Flea having a good square meal.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94He had a good slice of luck, Jack Mooney was telling me, over that\r\nboxingmatch Myler Keogh won again that soldier in the Portobello\r\nbarracks. By God, he had the little kipper down in the county Carlow he\r\nwas telling me...\r\n\r\nHope that dewdrop doesn\xe2\x80\x99t come down into his glass. No, snuffled it up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94For near a month, man, before it came off. Sucking duck eggs by God\r\ntill further orders. Keep him off the boose, see? O, by God, Blazes is a\r\nhairy chap.\r\n\r\nDavy Byrne came forward from the hindbar in tuckstitched shirtsleeves,\r\ncleaning his lips with two wipes of his napkin. Herring\xe2\x80\x99s blush. Whose\r\nsmile upon each feature plays with such and such replete. Too much fat\r\non the parsnips.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94And here\xe2\x80\x99s himself and pepper on him, Nosey Flynn said. Can you give us\r\na good one for the Gold cup?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99m off that, Mr Flynn, Davy Byrne answered. I never put anything on a\r\nhorse.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94You\xe2\x80\x99re right there, Nosey Flynn said.\r\n\r\nMr Bloom ate his strips of sandwich, fresh clean bread, with relish of\r\ndisgust pungent mustard, the feety savour of green cheese. Sips of his\r\nwine soothed his palate. Not logwood that. Tastes fuller this weather\r\nwith the chill off.\r\n\r\nNice quiet bar. Nice piece of wood in that counter. Nicely planed. Like\r\nthe way it curves there.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do anything at all in that line, Davy Byrne said. It ruined\r\nmany a man, the same horses.\r\n\r\nVintners\xe2\x80\x99 sweepstake. Licensed for the sale of beer, wine and spirits\r\nfor consumption on the premises. Heads I win tails you lose.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94True for you, Nosey Flynn said. Unless you\xe2\x80\x99re in the know. There\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nno straight sport going now. Lenehan gets some good ones. He\xe2\x80\x99s giving\r\nSceptre today. Zinfandel\xe2\x80\x99s the favourite, Lord Howard de Walden\xe2\x80\x99s, won\r\nat Epsom. Morny Cannon is riding him. I could have got seven to one\r\nagainst Saint Amant a fortnight before.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94That so? Davy Byrne said...\r\n\r\nHe went towards the window and, taking up the pettycash book, scanned\r\nits pages.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I could, faith, Nosey Flynn said, snuffling. That was a rare bit of\r\nhorseflesh. Saint Frusquin was her sire. She won in a thunderstorm,\r\nRothschild\xe2\x80\x99s filly, with wadding in her ears. Blue jacket and yellow\r\ncap. Bad luck to big Ben Dollard and his John O\xe2\x80\x99Gaunt. He put me off it.\r\nAy.\r\n\r\nHe drank resignedly from his tumbler, running his fingers down the\r\nflutes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Ay, he said, sighing.\r\n\r\nMr Bloom, champing, standing, looked upon his sigh. Nosey numbskull.\r\nWill I tell him that horse Lenehan? He knows already. Better let him\r\nforget. Go and lose more. Fool and his money. Dewdrop coming down again.\r\nCold nose he\xe2\x80\x99d have kissing a woman. Still they might like. Prickly\r\nbeards they like. Dogs\xe2\x80\x99 cold noses. Old Mrs Riordan with the rumbling\r\nstomach\xe2\x80\x99s Skye terrier in the City Arms hotel. Molly fondling him in her\r\nlap. O, the big doggybowwowsywowsy!\r\n\r\nWine soaked and softened rolled pith of bread mustard a moment mawkish\r\ncheese. Nice wine it is. Taste it better because I\xe2\x80\x99m not thirsty. Bath\r\nof course does that. Just a bite or two. Then about six o\xe2\x80\x99clock I can.\r\nSix. Six. Time will be gone then. She...\r\n\r\nMild fire of wine kindled his veins. I wanted that badly. Felt so\r\noff colour. His eyes unhungrily saw shelves of tins: sardines, gaudy\r\nlobsters\xe2\x80\x99 claws. All the odd things people pick up for food. Out of\r\nshells, periwinkles with a pin, off trees, snails out of the ground the\r\nFrench eat, out of the sea with bait on a hook. Silly fish learn nothing\r\nin a thousand years. If you didn\xe2\x80\x99t know risky putting anything into your\r\nmouth. Poisonous berries. Johnny Magories. Roundness you think good.\r\nGaudy colour warns you off. One fellow told another and so on. Try it\r\non the dog first. Led on by the smell or the look. Tempting fruit.\r\nIce cones. Cream. Instinct. Orangegroves for instance. Need artificial\r\nirrigation. Bleibtreustrasse. Yes but what about oysters. Unsightly like\r\na clot of phlegm. Filthy shells. Devil to open them too. Who found them\r\nout? Garbage, sewage they feed on. Fizz and Red bank oysters. Effect\r\non the sexual. Aphrodis. He was in the Red Bank this morning. Was he\r\noysters old fish at table perhaps he young flesh in bed no June has\r\nno ar no oysters. But there are people like things high. Tainted game.\r\nJugged hare. First catch your hare. Chinese eating eggs fifty years old,\r\nblue and green again. Dinner of thirty courses. Each dish harmless might\r\nmix inside. Idea for a poison mystery. That archduke Leopold was it no\r\nyes or was it Otto one of those Habsburgs? Or who was it used to eat the\r\nscruff off his own head? Cheapest lunch in town. Of course aristocrats,\r\nthen the others copy to be in the fashion. Milly too rock oil and flour.\r\nRaw pastry I like myself. Half the catch of oysters they throw back in\r\nthe sea to keep up the price. Cheap no-one would buy. Caviare. Do the\r\ngrand. Hock in green glasses. Swell blowout. Lady this. Powdered bosom\r\npearls. The \xc3\xa9lite. Cr\xc3\xa8me de la cr\xc3\xa8me. They want special dishes to\r\npretend they\xe2\x80\x99re. Hermit with a platter of pulse keep down the stings\r\nof the flesh. Know me come eat with me. Royal sturgeon high sheriff,\r\nCoffey, the butcher, right to venisons of the forest from his ex. Send\r\nhim back the half of a cow. Spread I saw down in the Master of the\r\nRolls\xe2\x80\x99 kitchen area. Whitehatted chef like a rabbi. Combustible duck.\r\nCurly cabbage \xc3\xa0 la duchesse de Parme. Just as well to write it on the\r\nbill of fare so you can know what you\xe2\x80\x99ve eaten. Too many drugs spoil the\r\nbroth. I know it myself. Dosing it with Edwards\xe2\x80\x99 desiccated soup. Geese\r\nstuffed silly for them. Lobsters boiled alive. Do ptake some ptarmigan.\r\nWouldn\xe2\x80\x99t mind being a waiter in a swell hotel. Tips, evening dress,\r\nhalfnaked ladies. May I tempt you to a little more filleted lemon sole,\r\nmiss Dubedat? Yes, do bedad. And she did bedad. Huguenot name I expect\r\nthat. A miss Dubedat lived in Killiney, I remember. Du de la is French.\r\nStill it\xe2\x80\x99s the same fish perhaps old Micky Hanlon of Moore street ripped\r\nthe guts out of making money hand over fist finger in fishes\xe2\x80\x99 gills\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t write his name on a cheque think he was painting the landscape\r\nwith his mouth twisted. Moooikill A Aitcha Ha ignorant as a kish of\r\nbrogues, worth fifty thousand pounds.\r\n\r\nStuck on the pane two flies buzzed, stuck.\r\n\r\nGlowing wine on his palate lingered swallowed. Crushing in the winepress\r\ngrapes of Burgundy. Sun\xe2\x80\x99s heat it is. Seems to a secret touch telling me\r\nmemory. Touched his sense moistened remembered. Hidden under wild ferns\r\non Howth below us bay sleeping: sky. No sound. The sky. The bay purple\r\nby the Lion\xe2\x80\x99s head. Green by Drumleck. Yellowgreen towards Sutton.\r\nFields of undersea, the lines faint brown in grass, buried cities.\r\nPillowed on my coat she had her hair, earwigs in the heather scrub\r\nmy hand under her nape, you\xe2\x80\x99ll toss me all. O wonder! Coolsoft with\r\nointments her hand touched me, caressed: her eyes upon me did not turn\r\naway. Ravished over her I lay, full lips full open, kissed her mouth.\r\nYum. Softly she gave me in my mouth the seedcake warm and chewed.\r\nMawkish pulp her mouth had mumbled sweetsour of her spittle. Joy: I ate\r\nit: joy. Young life, her lips that gave me pouting. Soft warm sticky\r\ngumjelly lips. Flowers her eyes were, take me, willing eyes. Pebbles\r\nfell. She lay still. A goat. No-one. High on Ben Howth rhododendrons a\r\nnannygoat walking surefooted, dropping currants. Screened under ferns\r\nshe laughed warmfolded. Wildly I lay on her, kissed her: eyes, her lips,\r\nher stretched neck beating, woman\xe2\x80\x99s breasts full in her blouse of nun\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nveiling, fat nipples upright. Hot I tongued her. She kissed me. I was\r\nkissed. All yielding she tossed my hair. Kissed, she kissed me.\r\n\r\nMe. And me now.\r\n\r\nStuck, the flies buzzed.\r\n\r\nHis downcast eyes followed the silent veining of the oaken slab. Beauty:\r\nit curves: curves are beauty. Shapely goddesses, Venus, Juno: curves the\r\nworld admires. Can see them library museum standing in the round hall,\r\nnaked goddesses. Aids to digestion. They don\xe2\x80\x99t care what man looks. All\r\nto see. Never speaking. I mean to say to fellows like Flynn. Suppose she\r\ndid Pygmalion and Galatea what would she say first? Mortal! Put you in\r\nyour proper place. Quaffing nectar at mess with gods golden dishes, all\r\nambrosial. Not like a tanner lunch we have, boiled mutton, carrots and\r\nturnips, bottle of Allsop. Nectar imagine it drinking electricity: gods\xe2\x80\x99\r\nfood. Lovely forms of women sculped Junonian. Immortal lovely. And we\r\nstuffing food in one hole and out behind: food, chyle, blood, dung,\r\nearth, food: have to feed it like stoking an engine. They have no. Never\r\nlooked. I\xe2\x80\x99ll look today. Keeper won\xe2\x80\x99t see. Bend down let something fall\r\nsee if she.\r\n\r\nDribbling a quiet message from his bladder came to go to do not to\r\ndo there to do. A man and ready he drained his glass to the lees and\r\nwalked, to men too they gave themselves, manly conscious, lay with men\r\nlovers, a youth enjoyed her, to the yard.\r\n\r\nWhen the sound of his boots had ceased Davy Byrne said from his book:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94What is this he is? Isn\xe2\x80\x99t he in the insurance line?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94He\xe2\x80\x99s out of that long ago, Nosey Flynn said. He does canvassing for the\r\nFreeman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I know him well to see, Davy Byrne said. Is he in trouble?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Trouble? Nosey Flynn said. Not that I heard of. Why?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I noticed he was in mourning.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Was he? Nosey Flynn said. So he was, faith. I asked him how was all at\r\nhome. You\xe2\x80\x99re right, by God. So he was.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I never broach the subject, Davy Byrne said humanely, if I see a\r\ngentleman is in trouble that way. It only brings it up fresh in their\r\nminds.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94It\xe2\x80\x99s not the wife anyhow, Nosey Flynn said. I met him the day before\r\nyesterday and he coming out of that Irish farm dairy John Wyse Nolan\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwife has in Henry street with a jar of cream in his hand taking it home\r\nto his better half. She\xe2\x80\x99s well nourished, I tell you. Plovers on toast.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94And is he doing for the Freeman? Davy Byrne said.\r\n\r\nNosey Flynn pursed his lips.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94He doesn\xe2\x80\x99t buy cream on the ads he picks up. You can make bacon of\r\nthat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94How so? Davy Byrne asked, coming from his book.\r\n\r\nNosey Flynn made swift passes in the air with juggling fingers. He\r\nwinked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94He\xe2\x80\x99s in the craft, he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Do you tell me so? Davy Byrne said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Very much so, Nosey Flynn said. Ancient free and accepted order. He\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nan excellent brother. Light, life and love, by God. They give him a leg\r\nup. I was told that by a\xe2\x80\x94well, I won\xe2\x80\x99t say who.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Is that a fact?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94O, it\xe2\x80\x99s a fine order, Nosey Flynn said. They stick to you when you\xe2\x80\x99re\r\ndown. I know a fellow was trying to get into it. But they\xe2\x80\x99re as close as\r\ndamn it. By God they did right to keep the women out of it.\r\n\r\nDavy Byrne smiledyawnednodded all in one:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Iiiiiichaaaaaaach!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94There was one woman, Nosey Flynn said, hid herself in a clock to find\r\nout what they do be doing. But be damned but they smelt her out and\r\nswore her in on the spot a master mason. That was one of the saint\r\nLegers of Doneraile.\r\n\r\nDavy Byrne, sated after his yawn, said with tearwashed eyes:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94And is that a fact? Decent quiet man he is. I often saw him in here and\r\nI never once saw him\xe2\x80\x94you know, over the line.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94God Almighty couldn\xe2\x80\x99t make him drunk, Nosey Flynn said firmly. Slips\r\noff when the fun gets too hot. Didn\xe2\x80\x99t you see him look at his watch? Ah,\r\nyou weren\xe2\x80\x99t there. If you ask him to have a drink first thing he does\r\nhe outs with the watch to see what he ought to imbibe. Declare to God he\r\ndoes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94There are some like that, Davy Byrne said. He\xe2\x80\x99s a safe man, I\xe2\x80\x99d say.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94He\xe2\x80\x99s not too bad, Nosey Flynn said, snuffling it up. He\xe2\x80\x99s been known to\r\nput his hand down too to help a fellow. Give the devil his due. O, Bloom\r\nhas his good points. But there\xe2\x80\x99s one thing he\xe2\x80\x99ll never do.\r\n\r\nHis hand scrawled a dry pen signature beside his grog.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I know, Davy Byrne said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Nothing in black and white, Nosey Flynn said.\r\n\r\nPaddy Leonard and Bantam Lyons came in. Tom Rochford followed frowning,\r\na plaining hand on his claret waistcoat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Day, Mr Byrne.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Day, gentlemen.\r\n\r\nThey paused at the counter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Who\xe2\x80\x99s standing? Paddy Leonard asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99m sitting anyhow, Nosey Flynn answered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Well, what\xe2\x80\x99ll it be? Paddy Leonard asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ll take a stone ginger, Bantam Lyons said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94How much? Paddy Leonard cried. Since when, for God\xe2\x80\x99 sake? What\xe2\x80\x99s yours,\r\nTom?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94How is the main drainage? Nosey Flynn asked, sipping.\r\n\r\nFor answer Tom Rochford pressed his hand to his breastbone and\r\nhiccupped.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Would I trouble you for a glass of fresh water, Mr Byrne? he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Certainly, sir.\r\n\r\nPaddy Leonard eyed his alemates.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Lord love a duck, he said. Look at what I\xe2\x80\x99m standing drinks to! Cold\r\nwater and gingerpop! Two fellows that would suck whisky off a sore leg.\r\nHe has some bloody horse up his sleeve for the Gold cup. A dead snip.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Zinfandel is it? Nosey Flynn asked.\r\n\r\nTom Rochford spilt powder from a twisted paper into the water set before\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94That cursed dyspepsia, he said before drinking.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Breadsoda is very good, Davy Byrne said.\r\n\r\nTom Rochford nodded and drank.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Is it Zinfandel?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Say nothing! Bantam Lyons winked. I\xe2\x80\x99m going to plunge five bob on my\r\nown.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Tell us if you\xe2\x80\x99re worth your salt and be damned to you, Paddy Leonard\r\nsaid. Who gave it to you?\r\n\r\nMr Bloom on his way out raised three fingers in greeting.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94So long! Nosey Flynn said.\r\n\r\nThe others turned.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94That\xe2\x80\x99s the man now that gave it to me, Bantam Lyons whispered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Prrwht! Paddy Leonard said with scorn. Mr Byrne, sir, we\xe2\x80\x99ll take two of\r\nyour small Jamesons after that and a...\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Stone ginger, Davy Byrne added civilly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Ay, Paddy Leonard said. A suckingbottle for the baby.\r\n\r\nMr Bloom walked towards Dawson street, his tongue brushing his teeth\r\nsmooth. Something green it would have to be: spinach, say. Then with\r\nthose R\xc3\xb6ntgen rays searchlight you could.\r\n\r\nAt Duke lane a ravenous terrier choked up a sick knuckly cud on the\r\ncobblestones and lapped it with new zest. Surfeit. Returned with thanks\r\nhaving fully digested the contents. First sweet then savoury. Mr Bloom\r\ncoasted warily. Ruminants. His second course. Their upper jaw they move.\r\nWonder if Tom Rochford will do anything with that invention of his?\r\nWasting time explaining it to Flynn\xe2\x80\x99s mouth. Lean people long mouths.\r\nOught to be a hall or a place where inventors could go in and invent\r\nfree. Course then you\xe2\x80\x99d have all the cranks pestering.\r\n\r\nHe hummed, prolonging in solemn echo the closes of the bars:\r\n\r\n      Don Giovanni, a cenar teco\r\n      M\xe2\x80\x99invitasti.\r\n\r\nFeel better. Burgundy. Good pick me up. Who distilled first? Some\r\nchap in the blues. Dutch courage. That Kilkenny People in the national\r\nlibrary now I must.\r\n\r\nBare clean closestools waiting in the window of William Miller, plumber,\r\nturned back his thoughts. They could: and watch it all the way down,\r\nswallow a pin sometimes come out of the ribs years after, tour round the\r\nbody changing biliary duct spleen squirting liver gastric juice coils of\r\nintestines like pipes. But the poor buffer would have to stand all the\r\ntime with his insides entrails on show. Science.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94A cenar teco.\r\n\r\nWhat does that teco mean? Tonight perhaps.\r\n\r\n     Don Giovanni, thou hast me invited\r\n     To come to supper tonight,\r\n     The rum the rumdum.\r\n\r\nDoesn\xe2\x80\x99t go properly.\r\n\r\nKeyes: two months if I get Nannetti to. That\xe2\x80\x99ll be two pounds ten about\r\ntwo pounds eight. Three Hynes owes me. Two eleven. Prescott\xe2\x80\x99s dyeworks\r\nvan over there. If I get Billy Prescott\xe2\x80\x99s ad: two fifteen. Five guineas\r\nabout. On the pig\xe2\x80\x99s back.\r\n\r\nCould buy one of those silk petticoats for Molly, colour of her new\r\ngarters.\r\n\r\nToday. Today. Not think.\r\n\r\nTour the south then. What about English wateringplaces? Brighton,\r\nMargate. Piers by moonlight. Her voice floating out. Those lovely\r\nseaside girls. Against John Long\xe2\x80\x99s a drowsing loafer lounged in heavy\r\nthought, gnawing a crusted knuckle. Handy man wants job. Small wages.\r\nWill eat anything.\r\n\r\nMr Bloom turned at Gray\xe2\x80\x99s confectioner\xe2\x80\x99s window of unbought tarts and\r\npassed the reverend Thomas Connellan\xe2\x80\x99s bookstore. Why I left the church\r\nof Rome? Birds\xe2\x80\x99 Nest. Women run him. They say they used to give pauper\r\nchildren soup to change to protestants in the time of the potato blight.\r\nSociety over the way papa went to for the conversion of poor jews. Same\r\nbait. Why we left the church of Rome.\r\n\r\nA blind stripling stood tapping the curbstone with his slender cane. No\r\ntram in sight. Wants to cross.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Do you want to cross? Mr Bloom asked.\r\n\r\nThe blind stripling did not answer. His wallface frowned weakly. He\r\nmoved his head uncertainly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94You\xe2\x80\x99re in Dawson street, Mr Bloom said. Molesworth street is opposite.\r\nDo you want to cross? There\xe2\x80\x99s nothing in the way.\r\n\r\nThe cane moved out trembling to the left. Mr Bloom\xe2\x80\x99s eye followed its\r\nline and saw again the dyeworks\xe2\x80\x99 van drawn up before Drago\xe2\x80\x99s. Where I\r\nsaw his brillantined hair just when I was. Horse drooping. Driver in\r\nJohn Long\xe2\x80\x99s. Slaking his drouth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94There\xe2\x80\x99s a van there, Mr Bloom said, but it\xe2\x80\x99s not moving. I\xe2\x80\x99ll see you\r\nacross. Do you want to go to Molesworth street?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Yes, the stripling answered. South Frederick street.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Come, Mr Bloom said.\r\n\r\nHe touched the thin elbow gently: then took the limp seeing hand to\r\nguide it forward.\r\n\r\nSay something to him. Better not do the condescending. They mistrust\r\nwhat you tell them. Pass a common remark.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94The rain kept off.\r\n\r\nNo answer.\r\n\r\nStains on his coat. Slobbers his food, I suppose. Tastes all different\r\nfor him. Have to be spoonfed first. Like a child\xe2\x80\x99s hand, his hand. Like\r\nMilly\xe2\x80\x99s was. Sensitive. Sizing me up I daresay from my hand. Wonder\r\nif he has a name. Van. Keep his cane clear of the horse\xe2\x80\x99s legs: tired\r\ndrudge get his doze. That\xe2\x80\x99s right. Clear. Behind a bull: in front of a\r\nhorse.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Thanks, sir.\r\n\r\nKnows I\xe2\x80\x99m a man. Voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Right now? First turn to the left.\r\n\r\nThe blind stripling tapped the curbstone and went on his way, drawing\r\nhis cane back, feeling again.\r\n\r\nMr Bloom walked behind the eyeless feet, a flatcut suit of herringbone\r\ntweed. Poor young fellow! How on earth did he know that van was there?\r\nMust have felt it. See things in their forehead perhaps: kind of sense\r\nof volume. Weight or size of it, something blacker than the dark. Wonder\r\nwould he feel it if something was removed. Feel a gap. Queer idea of\r\nDublin he must have, tapping his way round by the stones. Could he walk\r\nin a beeline if he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t that cane? Bloodless pious face like a fellow\r\ngoing in to be a priest.\r\n\r\nPenrose! That was that chap\xe2\x80\x99s name.\r\n\r\nLook at all the things they can learn to do. Read with their fingers.\r\nTune pianos. Or we are surprised they have any brains. Why we think a\r\ndeformed person or a hunchback clever if he says something we might say.\r\nOf course the other senses are more. Embroider. Plait baskets. People\r\nought to help. Workbasket I could buy for Molly\xe2\x80\x99s birthday. Hates\r\nsewing. Might take an objection. Dark men they call them.\r\n\r\nSense of smell must be stronger too. Smells on all sides, bunched\r\ntogether. Each street different smell. Each person too. Then the spring,\r\nthe summer: smells. Tastes? They say you can\xe2\x80\x99t taste wines with your\r\neyes shut or a cold in the head. Also smoke in the dark they say get no\r\npleasure.\r\n\r\nAnd with a woman, for instance. More shameless not seeing. That girl\r\npassing the Stewart institution, head in the air. Look at me. I have\r\nthem all on. Must be strange not to see her. Kind of a form in his\r\nmind\xe2\x80\x99s eye. The voice, temperatures: when he touches her with his\r\nfingers must almost see the lines, the curves. His hands on her hair,\r\nfor instance. Say it was black, for instance. Good. We call it black.\r\nThen passing over her white skin. Different feel perhaps. Feeling of\r\nwhite.\r\n\r\nPostoffice. Must answer. Fag today. Send her a postal order two\r\nshillings, half a crown. Accept my little present. Stationer\xe2\x80\x99s just here\r\ntoo. Wait. Think over it.\r\n\r\nWith a gentle finger he felt ever so slowly the hair combed back above\r\nhis ears. Again. Fibres of fine fine straw. Then gently his finger felt\r\nthe skin of his right cheek. Downy hair there too. Not smooth enough.\r\nThe belly is the smoothest. No-one about. There he goes into Frederick\r\nstreet. Perhaps to Levenston\xe2\x80\x99s dancing academy piano. Might be settling\r\nmy braces.\r\n\r\nWalking by Doran\xe2\x80\x99s publichouse he slid his hand between his waistcoat\r\nand trousers and, pulling aside his shirt gently, felt a slack fold of\r\nhis belly. But I know it\xe2\x80\x99s whitey yellow. Want to try in the dark to\r\nsee.\r\n\r\nHe withdrew his hand and pulled his dress to.\r\n\r\nPoor fellow! Quite a boy. Terrible. Really terrible. What dreams would\r\nhe have, not seeing? Life a dream for him. Where is the justice being\r\nborn that way? All those women and children excursion beanfeast burned\r\nand drowned in New York. Holocaust. Karma they call that transmigration\r\nfor sins you did in a past life the reincarnation met him pike hoses.\r\nDear, dear, dear. Pity, of course: but somehow you can\xe2\x80\x99t cotton on to\r\nthem someway.\r\n\r\nSir Frederick Falkiner going into the freemasons\xe2\x80\x99 hall. Solemn as Troy.\r\nAfter his good lunch in Earlsfort terrace. Old legal cronies cracking\r\na magnum. Tales of the bench and assizes and annals of the bluecoat\r\nschool. I sentenced him to ten years. I suppose he\xe2\x80\x99d turn up his nose\r\nat that stuff I drank. Vintage wine for them, the year marked on a\r\ndusty bottle. Has his own ideas of justice in the recorder\xe2\x80\x99s court.\r\nWellmeaning old man. Police chargesheets crammed with cases get their\r\npercentage manufacturing crime. Sends them to the rightabout. The devil\r\non moneylenders. Gave Reuben J a great strawcalling. Now he\xe2\x80\x99s really\r\nwhat they call a dirty jew. Power those judges have. Crusty old topers\r\nin wigs. Bear with a sore paw. And may the Lord have mercy on your soul.\r\n\r\nHello, placard. Mirus bazaar. His Excellency the lord lieutenant.\r\nSixteenth. Today it is. In aid of funds for Mercer\xe2\x80\x99s hospital. The\r\nMessiah was first given for that. Yes. Handel. What about going out\r\nthere: Ballsbridge. Drop in on Keyes. No use sticking to him like a\r\nleech. Wear out my welcome. Sure to know someone on the gate.\r\n\r\nMr Bloom came to Kildare street. First I must. Library.\r\n\r\nStraw hat in sunlight. Tan shoes. Turnedup trousers. It is. It is.\r\n\r\nHis heart quopped softly. To the right. Museum. Goddesses. He swerved to\r\nthe right.\r\n\r\nIs it? Almost certain. Won\xe2\x80\x99t look. Wine in my face. Why did I? Too\r\nheady. Yes, it is. The walk. Not see. Get on.\r\n\r\nMaking for the museum gate with long windy steps he lifted his eyes.\r\nHandsome building. Sir Thomas Deane designed. Not following me?\r\n\r\nDidn\xe2\x80\x99t see me perhaps. Light in his eyes.\r\n\r\nThe flutter of his breath came forth in short sighs. Quick. Cold\r\nstatues: quiet there. Safe in a minute.\r\n\r\nNo. Didn\xe2\x80\x99t see me. After two. Just at the gate.\r\n\r\nMy heart!\r\n\r\nHis eyes beating looked steadfastly at cream curves of stone. Sir Thomas\r\nDeane was the Greek architecture.\r\n\r\nLook for something I.\r\n\r\nHis hasty hand went quick into a pocket, took out, read unfolded\r\nAgendath Netaim. Where did I?\r\n\r\nBusy looking.\r\n\r\nHe thrust back quick Agendath.\r\n\r\nAfternoon she said.\r\n\r\nI am looking for that. Yes, that. Try all pockets. Handker. Freeman.\r\nWhere did I? Ah, yes. Trousers. Potato. Purse. Where?\r\n\r\nHurry. Walk quietly. Moment more. My heart.\r\n\r\nHis hand looking for the where did I put found in his hip pocket soap\r\nlotion have to call tepid paper stuck. Ah soap there I yes. Gate.\r\n\r\nSafe!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[ 9 ]\r\n\r\nUrbane, to comfort them, the quaker librarian purred:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94And we have, have we not, those priceless pages of Wilhelm Meister.\r\nA great poet on a great brother poet. A hesitating soul taking arms\r\nagainst a sea of troubles, torn by conflicting doubts, as one sees in\r\nreal life.\r\n\r\nHe came a step a sinkapace forward on neatsleather creaking and a step\r\nbackward a sinkapace on the solemn floor.\r\n\r\nA noiseless attendant setting open the door but slightly made him a\r\nnoiseless beck.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Directly, said he, creaking to go, albeit lingering. The beautiful\r\nineffectual dreamer who comes to grief against hard facts. One always\r\nfeels that Goethe\xe2\x80\x99s judgments are so true. True in the larger analysis.\r\n\r\nTwicreakingly analysis he corantoed off. Bald, most zealous by the door\r\nhe gave his large ear all to the attendant\xe2\x80\x99s words: heard them: and was\r\ngone.\r\n\r\nTwo left.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Monsieur de la Palice, Stephen sneered, was alive fifteen minutes\r\nbefore his death.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Have you found those six brave medicals, John Eglinton asked with\r\nelder\xe2\x80\x99s gall, to write Paradise Lost at your dictation? The Sorrows of\r\nSatan he calls it.\r\n\r\nSmile. Smile Cranly\xe2\x80\x99s smile.\r\n\r\n     First he tickled her\r\n     Then he patted her\r\n     Then he passed the female catheter\r\n     For he was a medical\r\n     Jolly old medi...\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I feel you would need one more for Hamlet. Seven is dear to the mystic\r\nmind. The shining seven W.B. calls them.\r\n\r\nGlittereyed his rufous skull close to his greencapped desklamp sought\r\nthe face bearded amid darkgreener shadow, an ollav, holyeyed. He laughed\r\nlow: a sizar\xe2\x80\x99s laugh of Trinity: unanswered.\r\n\r\n     Orchestral Satan, weeping many a rood\r\n     Tears such as angels weep.\r\n     Ed egli avea del cul fatto trombetta.\r\n\r\nHe holds my follies hostage.\r\n\r\nCranly\xe2\x80\x99s eleven true Wicklowmen to free their sireland. Gaptoothed\r\nKathleen, her four beautiful green fields, the stranger in her house.\r\nAnd one more to hail him: ave, rabbi: the Tinahely twelve. In the shadow\r\nof the glen he cooees for them. My soul\xe2\x80\x99s youth I gave him, night by\r\nnight. God speed. Good hunting.\r\n\r\nMulligan has my telegram.\r\n\r\nFolly. Persist.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Our young Irish bards, John Eglinton censured, have yet to create a\r\nfigure which the world will set beside Saxon Shakespeare\xe2\x80\x99s Hamlet though\r\nI admire him, as old Ben did, on this side idolatry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94All these questions are purely academic, Russell oracled out of his\r\nshadow. I mean, whether Hamlet is Shakespeare or James I or Essex.\r\nClergymen\xe2\x80\x99s discussions of the historicity of Jesus. Art has to reveal\r\nto us ideas, formless spiritual essences. The supreme question about a\r\nwork of art is out of how deep a life does it spring. The painting of\r\nGustave Moreau is the painting of ideas. The deepest poetry of Shelley,\r\nthe words of Hamlet bring our minds into contact with the eternal\r\nwisdom, Plato\xe2\x80\x99s world of ideas. All the rest is the speculation of\r\nschoolboys for schoolboys.\r\n\r\nA. E. has been telling some yankee interviewer. Wall, tarnation strike\r\nme!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94The schoolmen were schoolboys first, Stephen said superpolitely.\r\nAristotle was once Plato\xe2\x80\x99s schoolboy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94And has remained so, one should hope, John Eglinton sedately said. One\r\ncan see him, a model schoolboy with his diploma under his arm.\r\n\r\nHe laughed again at the now smiling bearded face.\r\n\r\nFormless spiritual. Father, Word and Holy Breath. Allfather, the\r\nheavenly man. Hiesos Kristos, magician of the beautiful, the Logos who\r\nsuffers in us at every moment. This verily is that. I am the fire upon\r\nthe altar. I am the sacrificial butter.\r\n\r\nDunlop, Judge, the noblest Roman of them all, A.E., Arval, the Name\r\nIneffable, in heaven hight: K.H., their master, whose identity is no\r\nsecret to adepts. Brothers of the great white lodge always watching\r\nto see if they can help. The Christ with the bridesister, moisture of\r\nlight, born of an ensouled virgin, repentant sophia, departed to the\r\nplane of buddhi. The life esoteric is not for ordinary person. O.P.\r\nmust work off bad karma first. Mrs Cooper Oakley once glimpsed our very\r\nillustrious sister H.P.B.\xe2\x80\x98s elemental.\r\n\r\nO, fie! Out on\xe2\x80\x99t! Pfuiteufel! You naughtn\xe2\x80\x99t to look, missus, so you\r\nnaughtn\xe2\x80\x99t when a lady\xe2\x80\x99s ashowing of her elemental.\r\n\r\nMr Best entered, tall, young, mild, light. He bore in his hand with\r\ngrace a notebook, new, large, clean, bright.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94That model schoolboy, Stephen said, would find Hamlet\xe2\x80\x99s musings about\r\nthe afterlife of his princely soul, the improbable, insignificant and\r\nundramatic monologue, as shallow as Plato\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\nJohn Eglinton, frowning, said, waxing wroth:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Upon my word it makes my blood boil to hear anyone compare Aristotle\r\nwith Plato.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Which of the two, Stephen asked, would have banished me from his\r\ncommonwealth?\r\n\r\nUnsheathe your dagger definitions. Horseness is the whatness of\r\nallhorse. Streams of tendency and eons they worship. God: noise in the\r\nstreet: very peripatetic. Space: what you damn well have to see. Through\r\nspaces smaller than red globules of man\xe2\x80\x99s blood they creepycrawl after\r\nBlake\xe2\x80\x99s buttocks into eternity of which this vegetable world is but a\r\nshadow. Hold to the now, the here, through which all future plunges to\r\nthe past.\r\n\r\nMr Best came forward, amiable, towards his colleague.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Haines is gone, he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Is he?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I was showing him Jubainville\xe2\x80\x99s book. He\xe2\x80\x99s quite enthusiastic, don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nyou know, about Hyde\xe2\x80\x99s Lovesongs of Connacht. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t bring him in to\r\nhear the discussion. He\xe2\x80\x99s gone to Gill\xe2\x80\x99s to buy it.\r\n\r\n     Bound thee forth, my booklet, quick\r\n     To greet the callous public.\r\n     Writ, I ween, \xe2\x80\x98twas not my wish\r\n     In lean unlovely English.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94The peatsmoke is going to his head, John Eglinton opined.\r\n\r\nWe feel in England. Penitent thief. Gone. I smoked his baccy. Green\r\ntwinkling stone. An emerald set in the ring of the sea.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94People do not know how dangerous lovesongs can be, the auric egg of\r\nRussell warned occultly. The movements which work revolutions in the\r\nworld are born out of the dreams and visions in a peasant\xe2\x80\x99s heart on the\r\nhillside. For them the earth is not an exploitable ground but the\r\nliving mother. The rarefied air of the academy and the arena produce the\r\nsixshilling novel, the musichall song. France produces the finest flower\r\nof corruption in Mallarm\xc3\xa9 but the desirable life is revealed only to the\r\npoor of heart, the life of Homer\xe2\x80\x99s Ph\xc3\xa6acians.\r\n\r\nFrom these words Mr Best turned an unoffending face to Stephen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Mallarm\xc3\xa9, don\xe2\x80\x99t you know, he said, has written those wonderful prose\r\npoems Stephen MacKenna used to read to me in Paris. The one about\r\nHamlet. He says: il se prom\xc3\xa8ne, lisant au livre de lui-m\xc3\xaame, don\xe2\x80\x99t you\r\nknow, reading the book of himself. He describes Hamlet given in a French\r\ntown, don\xe2\x80\x99t you know, a provincial town. They advertised it.\r\n\r\nHis free hand graciously wrote tiny signs in air.\r\n\r\n     Hamlet\r\n     ou\r\n     Le Distrait\r\n     Pi\xc3\xa8ce de Shakespeare\r\n\r\nHe repeated to John Eglinton\xe2\x80\x99s newgathered frown:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Pi\xc3\xa8ce de Shakespeare, don\xe2\x80\x99t you know. It\xe2\x80\x99s so French. The French point\r\nof view. Hamlet ou...\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94The absentminded beggar, Stephen ended.\r\n\r\nJohn Eglinton laughed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Yes, I suppose it would be, he said. Excellent people, no doubt, but\r\ndistressingly shortsighted in some matters.\r\n\r\nSumptuous and stagnant exaggeration of murder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94A deathsman of the soul Robert Greene called him, Stephen said. Not\r\nfor nothing was he a butcher\xe2\x80\x99s son, wielding the sledded poleaxe and\r\nspitting in his palms. Nine lives are taken off for his father\xe2\x80\x99s one.\r\nOur Father who art in purgatory. Khaki Hamlets don\xe2\x80\x99t hesitate to\r\nshoot. The bloodboltered shambles in act five is a forecast of the\r\nconcentration camp sung by Mr Swinburne.\r\n\r\nCranly, I his mute orderly, following battles from afar.\r\n\r\n      Whelps and dams of murderous foes whom none\r\n      But we had spared...\r\n\r\nBetween the Saxon smile and yankee yawp. The devil and the deep sea.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94He will have it that Hamlet is a ghoststory, John Eglinton said for Mr\r\nBest\xe2\x80\x99s behoof. Like the fat boy in Pickwick he wants to make our flesh\r\ncreep.\r\n\r\nList! List! O List!\r\n\r\nMy flesh hears him: creeping, hears.\r\n\r\nIf thou didst ever...\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94What is a ghost? Stephen said with tingling energy. One who has faded\r\ninto impalpability through death, through absence, through change of\r\nmanners. Elizabethan London lay as far from Stratford as corrupt Paris\r\nlies from virgin Dublin. Who is the ghost from limbo patrum, returning\r\nto the world that has forgotten him? Who is King Hamlet?\r\n\r\nJohn Eglinton shifted his spare body, leaning back to judge.\r\n\r\nLifted.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94It is this hour of a day in mid June, Stephen said, begging with a\r\nswift glance their hearing. The flag is up on the playhouse by the\r\nbankside. The bear Sackerson growls in the pit near it, Paris garden.\r\nCanvasclimbers who sailed with Drake chew their sausages among the\r\ngroundlings.\r\n\r\nLocal colour. Work in all you know. Make them accomplices.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Shakespeare has left the huguenot\xe2\x80\x99s house in Silver street and walks by\r\nthe swanmews along the riverbank. But he does not stay to feed the pen\r\nchivying her game of cygnets towards the rushes. The swan of Avon has\r\nother thoughts.\r\n\r\nComposition of place. Ignatius Loyola, make haste to help me!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94The play begins. A player comes on under the shadow, made up in the\r\ncastoff mail of a court buck, a wellset man with a bass voice. It is the\r\nghost, the king, a king and no king, and the player is Shakespeare who\r\nhas studied Hamlet all the years of his life which were not vanity in\r\norder to play the part of the spectre. He speaks the words to Burbage,\r\nthe young player who stands before him beyond the rack of cerecloth,\r\ncalling him by a name:\r\n\r\nHamlet, I am thy father\xe2\x80\x99s spirit,\r\n\r\nbidding him list. To a son he speaks, the son of his soul, the prince,\r\nyoung Hamlet and to the son of his body, Hamnet Shakespeare, who has\r\ndied in Stratford that his namesake may live for ever.\r\n\r\nIs it possible that that player Shakespeare, a ghost by absence, and in\r\nthe vesture of buried Denmark, a ghost by death, speaking his own words\r\nto his own son\xe2\x80\x99s name (had Hamnet Shakespeare lived he would have been\r\nprince Hamlet\xe2\x80\x99s twin), is it possible, I want to know, or probable that\r\nhe did not draw or foresee the logical conclusion of those premises: you\r\nare the dispossessed son: I am the murdered father: your mother is the\r\nguilty queen, Ann Shakespeare, born Hathaway?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94But this prying into the family life of a great man, Russell began\r\nimpatiently.\r\n\r\nArt thou there, truepenny?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Interesting only to the parish clerk. I mean, we have the plays. I\r\nmean when we read the poetry of King Lear what is it to us how the poet\r\nlived? As for living our servants can do that for us, Villiers de l\xe2\x80\x99Isle\r\nhas said. Peeping and prying into greenroom gossip of the day, the\r\npoet\xe2\x80\x99s drinking, the poet\xe2\x80\x99s debts. We have King Lear: and it is\r\nimmortal.\r\n\r\nMr Best\xe2\x80\x99s face, appealed to, agreed.\r\n\r\n      Flow over them with your waves and with your waters, Mananaan,\r\n      Mananaan MacLir...\r\n\r\nHow now, sirrah, that pound he lent you when you were hungry?\r\n\r\nMarry, I wanted it.\r\n\r\nTake thou this noble.\r\n\r\nGo to! You spent most of it in Georgina Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s bed, clergyman\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndaughter. Agenbite of inwit.\r\n\r\nDo you intend to pay it back?\r\n\r\nO, yes.\r\n\r\nWhen? Now?\r\n\r\nWell... No.\r\n\r\nWhen, then?\r\n\r\nI paid my way. I paid my way.\r\n\r\nSteady on. He\xe2\x80\x99s from beyant Boyne water. The northeast corner. You owe\r\nit.\r\n\r\nWait. Five months. Molecules all change. I am other I now. Other I got\r\npound.\r\n\r\nBuzz. Buzz.\r\n\r\nBut I, entelechy, form of forms, am I by memory because under\r\neverchanging forms.\r\n\r\nI that sinned and prayed and fasted.\r\n\r\nA child Conmee saved from pandies.\r\n\r\nI, I and I. I.\r\n\r\nA.E.I.O.U.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Do you mean to fly in the face of the tradition of three centuries?\r\nJohn Eglinton\xe2\x80\x99s carping voice asked. Her ghost at least has been laid\r\nfor ever. She died, for literature at least, before she was born.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94She died, Stephen retorted, sixtyseven years after she was born. She\r\nsaw him into and out of the world. She took his first embraces. She bore\r\nhis children and she laid pennies on his eyes to keep his eyelids closed\r\nwhen he lay on his deathbed.\r\n\r\nMother\xe2\x80\x99s deathbed. Candle. The sheeted mirror. Who brought me into\r\nthis world lies there, bronzelidded, under few cheap flowers. Liliata\r\nrutilantium.\r\n\r\nI wept alone.\r\n\r\nJohn Eglinton looked in the tangled glowworm of his lamp.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94The world believes that Shakespeare made a mistake, he said, and got\r\nout of it as quickly and as best he could.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Bosh! Stephen said rudely. A man of genius makes no mistakes. His\r\nerrors are volitional and are the portals of discovery.\r\n\r\nPortals of discovery opened to let in the quaker librarian,\r\nsoftcreakfooted, bald, eared and assiduous.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94A shrew, John Eglinton said shrewdly, is not a useful portal of\r\ndiscovery, one should imagine. What useful discovery did Socrates learn\r\nfrom Xanthippe?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Dialectic, Stephen answered: and from his mother how to bring thoughts\r\ninto the world. What he learnt from his other wife Myrto (absit nomen!),\r\nSocratididion\xe2\x80\x99s Epipsychidion, no man, not a woman, will ever know. But\r\nneither the midwife\xe2\x80\x99s lore nor the caudlelectures saved him from the\r\narchons of Sinn Fein and their naggin of hemlock.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94But Ann Hathaway? Mr Best\xe2\x80\x99s quiet voice said forgetfully. Yes, we seem\r\nto be forgetting her as Shakespeare himself forgot her.\r\n\r\nHis look went from brooder\xe2\x80\x99s beard to carper\xe2\x80\x99s skull, to remind, to\r\nchide them not unkindly, then to the baldpink lollard costard, guiltless\r\nthough maligned.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94He had a good groatsworth of wit, Stephen said, and no truant memory.\r\nHe carried a memory in his wallet as he trudged to Romeville whistling\r\nThe girl I left behind me. If the earthquake did not time it we should\r\nknow where to place poor Wat, sitting in his form, the cry of hounds,\r\nthe studded bridle and her blue windows. That memory, Venus and Adonis,\r\nlay in the bedchamber of every light-of-love in London. Is Katharine the\r\nshrew illfavoured? Hortensio calls her young and beautiful. Do you think\r\nthe writer of Antony and Cleopatra, a passionate pilgrim, had his\r\neyes in the back of his head that he chose the ugliest doxy in all\r\nWarwickshire to lie withal? Good: he left her and gained the world\r\nof men. But his boywomen are the women of a boy. Their life, thought,\r\nspeech are lent them by males. He chose badly? He was chosen, it seems\r\nto me. If others have their will Ann hath a way. By cock, she was to\r\nblame. She put the comether on him, sweet and twentysix. The greyeyed\r\ngoddess who bends over the boy Adonis, stooping to conquer, as prologue\r\nto the swelling act, is a boldfaced Stratford wench who tumbles in a\r\ncornfield a lover younger than herself.\r\n\r\nAnd my turn? When?\r\n\r\nCome!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Ryefield, Mr Best said brightly, gladly, raising his new book, gladly,\r\nbrightly.\r\n\r\nHe murmured then with blond delight for all:\r\n\r\n      Between the acres of the rye\r\n      These pretty countryfolk would lie.\r\n\r\nParis: the wellpleased pleaser.\r\n\r\nA tall figure in bearded homespun rose from shadow and unveiled its\r\ncooperative watch.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I am afraid I am due at the Homestead.\r\n\r\nWhither away? Exploitable ground.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Are you going? John Eglinton\xe2\x80\x99s active eyebrows asked. Shall we see you\r\nat Moore\xe2\x80\x99s tonight? Piper is coming.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Piper! Mr Best piped. Is Piper back?\r\n\r\nPeter Piper pecked a peck of pick of peck of pickled pepper.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if I can. Thursday. We have our meeting. If I can get away\r\nin time.\r\n\r\nYogibogeybox in Dawson chambers. Isis Unveiled. Their Pali book we tried\r\nto pawn. Crosslegged under an umbrel umbershoot he thrones an Aztec\r\nlogos, functioning on astral levels, their oversoul, mahamahatma.

Mr Russell, rumour has it, is gathering together\r\na sheaf of our younger poets\xe2\x80\x99 verses. We are all looking forward\r\nanxiously.\r\n\r\nAnxiously he glanced in the cone of lamplight where three faces,\r\nlighted, shone.\r\n\r\nSee this. Remember.\r\n\r\nStephen looked down on a wide headless caubeen, hung on his\r\nashplanthandle over his knee. My casque and sword. Touch lightly with\r\ntwo index fingers. Aristotle\xe2\x80\x99s experiment. One or two? Necessity is that\r\nin virtue of which it is impossible that one can be otherwise. Argal,\r\none hat is one hat.\r\n\r\nListen.\r\n\r\nYoung Colum and Starkey. George Roberts is doing the commercial part.\r\nLongworth will give it a good puff in the Express. O, will he? I liked\r\nColum\xe2\x80\x99s Drover. Yes, I think he has that queer thing genius. Do you\r\nthink he has genius really? Yeats admired his line: As in wild earth\r\na Grecian vase. Did he? I hope you\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to come tonight. Malachi\r\nMulligan is coming too. Moore asked him to bring Haines. Did you hear\r\nMiss Mitchell\xe2\x80\x99s joke about Moore and Martyn? That Moore is Martyn\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwild oats? Awfully clever, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it? They remind one of Don Quixote and\r\nSancho Panza. Our national epic has yet to be written, Dr Sigerson says.\r\nMoore is the man for it. A knight of the rueful countenance here in\r\nDublin. With a saffron kilt? O\xe2\x80\x99Neill Russell? O, yes, he must speak the\r\ngrand old tongue. And his Dulcinea? James Stephens is doing some clever\r\nsketches. We are becoming important, it seems.\r\n\r\nCordelia. Cordoglio. Lir\xe2\x80\x99s loneliest daughter.\r\n\r\nNookshotten. Now your best French polish.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Thank you very much, Mr Russell, Stephen said, rising. If you will be\r\nso kind as to give the letter to Mr Norman...\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94O, yes. If he considers it important it will go in. We have so much\r\ncorrespondence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I understand, Stephen said. Thanks.\r\n\r\nGod ild you. The pigs\xe2\x80\x99 paper. Bullockbefriending.\r\n\r\nSynge has promised me an article for Dana too. Are we going to be read?\r\nI feel we are. The Gaelic league wants something in Irish. I hope you\r\nwill come round tonight. Bring Starkey.\r\n\r\nStephen sat down.\r\n\r\nThe quaker librarian came from the leavetakers. Blushing, his mask said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Mr Dedalus, your views are most illuminating.\r\n\r\nHe creaked to and fro, tiptoing up nearer heaven by the altitude of a\r\nchopine, and, covered by the noise of outgoing, said low:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Is it your view, then, that she was not faithful to the poet?\r\n\r\nAlarmed face asks me. Why did he come? Courtesy or an inward light?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Where there is a reconciliation, Stephen said, there must have been\r\nfirst a sundering.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Yes.\r\n\r\nChristfox in leather trews, hiding, a runaway in blighted treeforks,\r\nfrom hue and cry. Knowing no vixen, walking lonely in the chase. Women\r\nhe won to him, tender people, a whore of Babylon, ladies of justices,\r\nbully tapsters\xe2\x80\x99 wives. Fox and geese. And in New Place a slack\r\ndishonoured body that once was comely, once as sweet, as fresh as\r\ncinnamon, now her leaves falling, all, bare, frighted of the narrow\r\ngrave and unforgiven.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Yes. So you think...\r\n\r\nThe door closed behind the outgoer.\r\n\r\nRest suddenly possessed the discreet vaulted cell, rest of warm and\r\nbrooding air.\r\n\r\nA vestal\xe2\x80\x99s lamp.\r\n\r\nHere he ponders things that were not: what C\xc3\xa6sar would have lived to do\r\nhad he believed the soothsayer: what might have been: possibilities of\r\nthe possible as possible: things not known: what name Achilles bore when\r\nhe lived among women.\r\n\r\nCoffined thoughts around me, in mummycases, embalmed in spice of words.\r\nThoth, god of libraries, a birdgod, moonycrowned. And I heard the voice\r\nof that Egyptian highpriest. In painted chambers loaded with tilebooks.\r\n\r\nThey are still. Once quick in the brains of men. Still: but an itch of\r\ndeath is in them, to tell me in my ear a maudlin tale, urge me to wreak\r\ntheir will.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Certainly, John Eglinton mused, of all great men he is the most\r\nenigmatic. We know nothing but that he lived and suffered. Not even so\r\nmuch. Others abide our question. A shadow hangs over all the rest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94But Hamlet is so personal, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it? Mr Best pleaded. I mean, a kind of\r\nprivate paper, don\xe2\x80\x99t you know, of his private life. I mean, I don\xe2\x80\x99t care\r\na button, don\xe2\x80\x99t you know, who is killed or who is guilty...\r\n\r\nHe rested an innocent book on the edge of the desk, smiling his\r\ndefiance. His private papers in the original. Ta an bad ar an tir. Taim\r\nin mo shagart. Put beurla on it, littlejohn.\r\n\r\nQuoth littlejohn Eglinton:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I was prepared for paradoxes from what Malachi Mulligan told us but\r\nI may as well warn you that if you want to shake my belief that\r\nShakespeare is Hamlet you have a stern task before you.\r\n\r\nBear with me.\r\n\r\nStephen withstood the bane of miscreant eyes glinting stern under\r\nwrinkled brows. A basilisk. E quando vede l\xe2\x80\x99uomo l\xe2\x80\x99attosca. Messer\r\nBrunetto, I thank thee for the word.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94As we, or mother Dana, weave and unweave our bodies, Stephen said,\r\nfrom day to day, their molecules shuttled to and fro, so does the artist\r\nweave and unweave his image. And as the mole on my right breast is where\r\nit was when I was born, though all my body has been woven of new stuff\r\ntime after time, so through the ghost of the unquiet father the image\r\nof the unliving son looks forth. In the intense instant of imagination,\r\nwhen the mind, Shelley says, is a fading coal, that which I was is that\r\nwhich I am and that which in possibility I may come to be. So in the\r\nfuture, the sister of the past, I may see myself as I sit here now but\r\nby reflection from that which then I shall be.\r\n\r\nDrummond of Hawthornden helped you at that stile.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Yes, Mr Best said youngly. I feel Hamlet quite young. The bitterness\r\nmight be from the father but the passages with Ophelia are surely from\r\nthe son.\r\n\r\nHas the wrong sow by the lug. He is in my father. I am in his son.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94That mole is the last to go, Stephen said, laughing.\r\n\r\nJohn Eglinton made a nothing pleasing mow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94If that were the birthmark of genius, he said, genius would be a\r\ndrug in the market. The plays of Shakespeare\xe2\x80\x99s later years which Renan\r\nadmired so much breathe another spirit.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94The spirit of reconciliation, the quaker librarian breathed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94There can be no reconciliation, Stephen said, if there has not been a\r\nsundering.\r\n\r\nSaid that.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94If you want to know what are the events which cast their shadow over\r\nthe hell of time of King Lear, Othello, Hamlet, Troilus and Cressida,\r\nlook to see when and how the shadow lifts. What softens the heart of a\r\nman, shipwrecked in storms dire, Tried, like another Ulysses, Pericles,\r\nprince of Tyre?\r\n\r\nHead, redconecapped, buffeted, brineblinded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94A child, a girl, placed in his arms, Marina.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94The leaning of sophists towards the bypaths of apocrypha is a constant\r\nquantity, John Eglinton detected. The highroads are dreary but they lead\r\nto the town.\r\n\r\nGood Bacon: gone musty. Shakespeare Bacon\xe2\x80\x99s wild oats. Cypherjugglers\r\ngoing the highroads. Seekers on the great quest. What town, good\r\nmasters? Mummed in names: A. E., eon: Magee, John Eglinton. East of the\r\nsun, west of the moon: Tir na n-og. Booted the twain and staved.\r\n\r\n      How many miles to Dublin?\r\n      Three score and ten, sir.\r\n      Will we be there by candlelight?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Mr Brandes accepts it, Stephen said, as the first play of the closing\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Does he? What does Mr Sidney Lee, or Mr Simon Lazarus as some aver his\r\nname is, say of it?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Marina, Stephen said, a child of storm, Miranda, a wonder, Perdita,\r\nthat which was lost. What was lost is given back to him: his daughter\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nchild. My dearest wife, Pericles says, was like this maid. Will any man\r\nlove the daughter if he has not loved the mother?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94The art of being a grandfather, Mr Best gan murmur. L\xe2\x80\x99art d\xe2\x80\x99\xc3\xaatre\r\ngrand...\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Will he not see reborn in her, with the memory of his own youth added,\r\nanother image?\r\n\r\nDo you know what you are talking about? Love, yes. Word known to all\r\nmen. Amor vero aliquid alicui bonum vult unde et ea quae concupiscimus\r\n...\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94His own image to a man with that queer thing genius is the standard of\r\nall experience, material and moral. Such an appeal will touch him. The\r\nimages of other males of his blood will repel him. He will see in them\r\ngrotesque attempts of nature to foretell or to repeat himself.\r\n\r\nThe benign forehead of the quaker librarian enkindled rosily with hope.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I hope Mr Dedalus will work out his theory for the enlightenment of\r\nthe public. And we ought to mention another Irish commentator, Mr George\r\nBernard Shaw. Nor should we forget Mr Frank Harris. His articles on\r\nShakespeare in the Saturday Review were surely brilliant. Oddly enough\r\nhe too draws for us an unhappy relation with the dark lady of the\r\nsonnets. The favoured rival is William Herbert, earl of Pembroke. I own\r\nthat if the poet must be rejected such a rejection would seem more in\r\nharmony with\xe2\x80\x94what shall I say?\xe2\x80\x94our notions of what ought not to have\r\nbeen.\r\n\r\nFelicitously he ceased and held a meek head among them, auk\xe2\x80\x99s egg, prize\r\nof their fray.\r\n\r\nHe thous and thees her with grave husbandwords. Dost love, Miriam? Dost\r\nlove thy man?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94That may be too, Stephen said. There\xe2\x80\x99s a saying of Goethe\xe2\x80\x99s which Mr\r\nMagee likes to quote. Beware of what you wish for in youth because you\r\nwill get it in middle life. Why does he send to one who is a buonaroba,\r\na bay where all men ride, a maid of honour with a scandalous girlhood, a\r\nlordling to woo for him? He was himself a lord of language and had made\r\nhimself a coistrel gentleman and he had written Romeo and Juliet.\r\nWhy? Belief in himself has been untimely killed. He was overborne in a\r\ncornfield first (ryefield, I should say) and he will never be a victor\r\nin his own eyes after nor play victoriously the game of laugh and lie\r\ndown. Assumed dongiovannism will not save him. No later undoing will\r\nundo the first undoing. The tusk of the boar has wounded him there where\r\nlove lies ableeding. If the shrew is worsted yet there remains to her\r\nwoman\xe2\x80\x99s invisible weapon. There is, I feel in the words, some goad of\r\nthe flesh driving him into a new passion, a darker shadow of the first,\r\ndarkening even his own understanding of himself. A like fate awaits him\r\nand the two rages commingle in a whirlpool.\r\n\r\nThey list. And in the porches of their ears I pour.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94The soul has been before stricken mortally, a poison poured in the\r\nporch of a sleeping ear. But those who are done to death in sleep cannot\r\nknow the manner of their quell unless their Creator endow their souls\r\nwith that knowledge in the life to come. The poisoning and the beast\r\nwith two backs that urged it King Hamlet\xe2\x80\x99s ghost could not know of were\r\nhe not endowed with knowledge by his creator. That is why the speech\r\n(his lean unlovely English) is always turned elsewhere, backward.\r\nRavisher and ravished, what he would but would not, go with him from\r\nLucrece\xe2\x80\x99s bluecircled ivory globes to Imogen\xe2\x80\x99s breast, bare, with its\r\nmole cinquespotted. He goes back, weary of the creation he has piled up\r\nto hide him from himself, an old dog licking an old sore. But, because\r\nloss is his gain, he passes on towards eternity in undiminished\r\npersonality, untaught by the wisdom he has written or by the laws he\r\nhas revealed. His beaver is up. He is a ghost, a shadow now, the wind by\r\nElsinore\xe2\x80\x99s rocks or what you will, the sea\xe2\x80\x99s voice, a voice heard\r\nonly in the heart of him who is the substance of his shadow, the son\r\nconsubstantial with the father.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Amen! was responded from the doorway.\r\n\r\nHast thou found me, O mine enemy?\r\n\r\nEntr\xe2\x80\x99acte.\r\n\r\nA ribald face, sullen as a dean\xe2\x80\x99s, Buck Mulligan came forward, then\r\nblithe in motley, towards the greeting of their smiles. My telegram.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94You were speaking of the gaseous vertebrate, if I mistake not? he asked\r\nof Stephen.\r\n\r\nPrimrosevested he greeted gaily with his doffed Panama as with a bauble.\r\n\r\nThey make him welcome. Was Du verlachst wirst Du noch dienen.\r\n\r\nBrood of mockers: Photius, pseudomalachi, Johann Most.\r\n\r\nHe Who Himself begot middler the Holy Ghost and Himself sent Himself,\r\nAgenbuyer, between Himself and others, Who, put upon by His fiends,\r\nstripped and whipped, was nailed like bat to barndoor, starved on\r\ncrosstree, Who let Him bury, stood up, harrowed hell, fared into heaven\r\nand there these nineteen hundred years sitteth on the right hand of His\r\nOwn Self but yet shall come in the latter day to doom the quick and dead\r\nwhen all the quick shall be dead already.\r\n\r\nGlo\xe2\x80\x94o\xe2\x80\x94ri\xe2\x80\x94a in ex\xe2\x80\x94cel\xe2\x80\x94sis De\xe2\x80\x94o.\r\n\r\nHe lifts his hands. Veils fall. O, flowers! Bells with bells with bells\r\naquiring.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Yes, indeed, the quaker librarian said. A most instructive discussion.\r\nMr Mulligan, I\xe2\x80\x99ll be bound, has his theory too of the play and of\r\nShakespeare. All sides of life should be represented.\r\n\r\nHe smiled on all sides equally.\r\n\r\nBuck Mulligan thought, puzzled:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Shakespeare? he said. I seem to know the name.\r\n\r\nA flying sunny smile rayed in his loose features.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94To be sure, he said, remembering brightly. The chap that writes like\r\nSynge.\r\n\r\nMr Best turned to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Haines missed you, he said. Did you meet him? He\xe2\x80\x99ll see you after at\r\nthe D. B. C. He\xe2\x80\x99s gone to Gill\xe2\x80\x99s to buy Hyde\xe2\x80\x99s Lovesongs of Connacht.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I came through the museum, Buck Mulligan said. Was he here?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94The bard\xe2\x80\x99s fellowcountrymen, John Eglinton answered, are rather tired\r\nperhaps of our brilliancies of theorising. I hear that an actress played\r\nHamlet for the fourhundredandeighth time last night in Dublin. Vining\r\nheld that the prince was a woman. Has no-one made him out to be an\r\nIrishman? Judge Barton, I believe, is searching for some clues. He\r\nswears (His Highness not His Lordship) by saint Patrick.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94The most brilliant of all is that story of Wilde\xe2\x80\x99s, Mr Best said,\r\nlifting his brilliant notebook. That Portrait of Mr W. H. where he\r\nproves that the sonnets were written by a Willie Hughes, a man all hues.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94For Willie Hughes, is it not? the quaker librarian asked.\r\n\r\nOr Hughie Wills? Mr William Himself. W. H.: who am I?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I mean, for Willie Hughes, Mr Best said, amending his gloss easily. Of\r\ncourse it\xe2\x80\x99s all paradox, don\xe2\x80\x99t you know, Hughes and hews and hues,\r\nthe colour, but it\xe2\x80\x99s so typical the way he works it out. It\xe2\x80\x99s the very\r\nessence of Wilde, don\xe2\x80\x99t you know. The light touch.\r\n\r\nHis glance touched their faces lightly as he smiled, a blond ephebe.\r\nTame essence of Wilde.\r\n\r\nYou\xe2\x80\x99re darned witty. Three drams of usquebaugh you drank with Dan\r\nDeasy\xe2\x80\x99s ducats.\r\n\r\nHow much did I spend? O, a few shillings.\r\n\r\nFor a plump of pressmen. Humour wet and dry.\r\n\r\nWit. You would give your five wits for youth\xe2\x80\x99s proud livery he pranks\r\nin. Lineaments of gratified desire.\r\n\r\nThere be many mo. Take her for me. In pairing time. Jove, a cool ruttime\r\nsend them. Yea, turtledove her.\r\n\r\nEve. Naked wheatbellied sin. A snake coils her, fang in\xe2\x80\x99s kiss.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Do you think it is only a paradox? the quaker librarian was asking. The\r\nmocker is never taken seriously when he is most serious.\r\n\r\nThey talked seriously of mocker\xe2\x80\x99s seriousness.\r\n\r\nBuck Mulligan\xe2\x80\x99s again heavy face eyed Stephen awhile. Then, his head\r\nwagging, he came near, drew a folded telegram from his pocket. His\r\nmobile lips read, smiling with new delight.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Telegram! he said. Wonderful inspiration! Telegram! A papal bull!\r\n\r\nHe sat on a corner of the unlit desk, reading aloud joyfully:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94The sentimentalist is he who would enjoy without incurring the immense\r\ndebtorship for a thing done. Signed: Dedalus. Where did you launch it\r\nfrom? The kips? No. College Green. Have you drunk the four quid? The\r\naunt is going to call on your unsubstantial father. Telegram! Malachi\r\nMulligan, The Ship, lower Abbey street. O, you peerless mummer! O, you\r\npriestified Kinchite!\r\n\r\nJoyfully he thrust message and envelope into a pocket but keened in a\r\nquerulous brogue:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94It\xe2\x80\x99s what I\xe2\x80\x99m telling you, mister honey, it\xe2\x80\x99s queer and sick we were,\r\nHaines and myself, the time himself brought it in. \xe2\x80\x98Twas murmur we did\r\nfor a gallus potion would rouse a friar, I\xe2\x80\x99m thinking, and he limp with\r\nleching. And we one hour and two hours and three hours in Connery\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsitting civil waiting for pints apiece.\r\n\r\nHe wailed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94And we to be there, mavrone, and you to be unbeknownst sending us your\r\nconglomerations the way we to have our tongues out a yard long like the\r\ndrouthy clerics do be fainting for a pussful.\r\n\r\nStephen laughed.\r\n\r\nQuickly, warningfully Buck Mulligan bent down.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94The tramper Synge is looking for you, he said, to murder you. He heard\r\nyou pissed on his halldoor in Glasthule. He\xe2\x80\x99s out in pampooties to\r\nmurder you.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Me! Stephen exclaimed. That was your contribution to literature.\r\n\r\nBuck Mulligan gleefully bent back, laughing to the dark eavesdropping\r\nceiling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Murder you! he laughed.\r\n\r\nHarsh gargoyle face that warred against me over our mess of hash\r\nof lights in rue Saint-Andr\xc3\xa9-des-Arts. In words of words for words,\r\npalabras. Oisin with Patrick. Faunman he met in Clamart woods,\r\nbrandishing a winebottle. C\xe2\x80\x99est vendredi saint! Murthering Irish. His\r\nimage, wandering, he met. I mine. I met a fool i\xe2\x80\x99the forest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Mr Lyster, an attendant said from the door ajar.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94... in which everyone can find his own. So Mr Justice Madden in his\r\nDiary of Master William Silence has found the hunting terms... Yes? What\r\nis it?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94There\xe2\x80\x99s a gentleman here, sir, the attendant said, coming forward and\r\noffering a card. From the Freeman. He wants to see the files of the\r\nKilkenny People for last year.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Certainly, certainly, certainly. Is the gentleman?...\r\n\r\nHe took the eager card, glanced, not saw, laid down unglanced, looked,\r\nasked, creaked, asked:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Is he?... O, there!\r\n\r\nBrisk in a galliard he was off, out. In the daylit corridor he talked\r\nwith voluble pains of zeal, in duty bound, most fair, most kind, most\r\nhonest broadbrim.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94This gentleman? Freeman\xe2\x80\x99s Journal? Kilkenny People? To be sure. Good\r\nday, sir. Kilkenny... We have certainly...\r\n\r\nA patient silhouette waited, listening.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94All the leading provincial... Northern Whig, Cork Examiner, Enniscorthy\r\nGuardian, 1903... Will you please?... Evans, conduct this gentleman...\r\nIf you just follow the atten... Or, please allow me... This way...\r\nPlease, sir...\r\n\r\nVoluble, dutiful, he led the way to all the provincial papers, a bowing\r\ndark figure following his hasty heels.\r\n\r\nThe door closed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94The sheeny! Buck Mulligan cried.\r\n\r\nHe jumped up and snatched the card.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94What\xe2\x80\x99s his name? Ikey Moses? Bloom.\r\n\r\nHe rattled on:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Jehovah, collector of prepuces, is no more. I found him over in the\r\nmuseum where I went to hail the foamborn Aphrodite. The Greek mouth that\r\nhas never been twisted in prayer. Every day we must do homage to her.\r\nLife of life, thy lips enkindle.\r\n\r\nSuddenly he turned to Stephen:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94He knows you. He knows your old fellow. O, I fear me, he is Greeker\r\nthan the Greeks. His pale Galilean eyes were upon her mesial groove.\r\nVenus Kallipyge. O, the thunder of those loins! The god pursuing the\r\nmaiden hid.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94We want to hear more, John Eglinton decided with Mr Best\xe2\x80\x99s approval. We\r\nbegin to be interested in Mrs S. Till now we had thought of her, if at\r\nall, as a patient Griselda, a Penelope stayathome.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Antisthenes, pupil of Gorgias, Stephen said, took the palm of beauty\r\nfrom Kyrios Menelaus\xe2\x80\x99 brooddam, Argive Helen, the wooden mare of Troy\r\nin whom a score of heroes slept, and handed it to poor Penelope. Twenty\r\nyears he lived in London and, during part of that time, he drew a salary\r\nequal to that of the lord chancellor of Ireland. His life was rich. His\r\nart, more than the art of feudalism as Walt Whitman called it, is the\r\nart of surfeit. Hot herringpies, green mugs of sack, honeysauces, sugar\r\nof roses, marchpane, gooseberried pigeons, ringocandies. Sir Walter\r\nRaleigh, when they arrested him, had half a million francs on his\r\nback including a pair of fancy stays. The gombeenwoman Eliza Tudor had\r\nunderlinen enough to vie with her of Sheba. Twenty years he dallied\r\nthere between conjugial love and its chaste delights and scortatory love\r\nand its foul pleasures. You know Manningham\xe2\x80\x99s story of the burgher\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwife who bade Dick Burbage to her bed after she had seen him in Richard\r\nIII and how Shakespeare, overhearing, without more ado about nothing,\r\ntook the cow by the horns and, when Burbage came knocking at the gate,\r\nanswered from the capon\xe2\x80\x99s blankets: William the conqueror came before\r\nRichard III. And the gay lakin, mistress Fitton, mount and cry O, and\r\nhis dainty birdsnies, lady Penelope Rich, a clean quality woman is\r\nsuited for a player, and the punks of the bankside, a penny a time.\r\n\r\nCours la Reine. Encore vingt sous. Nous ferons de petites cochonneries.\r\nMinette? Tu veux?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94The height of fine society. And sir William Davenant of Oxford\xe2\x80\x99s mother\r\nwith her cup of canary for any cockcanary.\r\n\r\nBuck Mulligan, his pious eyes upturned, prayed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Blessed Margaret Mary Anycock!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94And Harry of six wives\xe2\x80\x99 daughter. And other lady friends from neighbour\r\nseats as Lawn Tennyson, gentleman poet, sings. But all those twenty\r\nyears what do you suppose poor Penelope in Stratford was doing behind\r\nthe diamond panes?\r\n\r\nDo and do. Thing done. In a rosery of Fetter lane of Gerard, herbalist,\r\nhe walks, greyedauburn. An azured harebell like her veins. Lids of\r\nJuno\xe2\x80\x99s eyes, violets. He walks. One life is all. One body. Do. But do.\r\nAfar, in a reek of lust and squalor, hands are laid on whiteness.\r\n\r\nBuck Mulligan rapped John Eglinton\xe2\x80\x99s desk sharply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Whom do you suspect? he challenged.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Say that he is the spurned lover in the sonnets. Once spurned twice\r\nspurned. But the court wanton spurned him for a lord, his dearmylove.\r\n\r\nLove that dare not speak its name.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94As an Englishman, you mean, John sturdy Eglinton put in, he loved a\r\nlord.\r\n\r\nOld wall where sudden lizards flash. At Charenton I watched them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94It seems so, Stephen said, when he wants to do for him, and for all\r\nother and singular uneared wombs, the holy office an ostler does for the\r\nstallion. Maybe, like Socrates, he had a midwife to mother as he had a\r\nshrew to wife. But she, the giglot wanton, did not break a bedvow. Two\r\ndeeds are rank in that ghost\xe2\x80\x99s mind: a broken vow and the dullbrained\r\nyokel on whom her favour has declined, deceased husband\xe2\x80\x99s brother. Sweet\r\nAnn, I take it, was hot in the blood. Once a wooer, twice a wooer.\r\n\r\nStephen turned boldly in his chair.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94The burden of proof is with you not with me, he said frowning. If you\r\ndeny that in the fifth scene of Hamlet he has branded her with infamy\r\ntell me why there is no mention of her during the thirtyfour years\r\nbetween the day she married him and the day she buried him. All those\r\nwomen saw their men down and under: Mary, her goodman John, Ann, her\r\npoor dear Willun, when he went and died on her, raging that he was the\r\nfirst to go, Joan, her four brothers, Judith, her husband and all her\r\nsons, Susan, her husband too, while Susan\xe2\x80\x99s daughter, Elizabeth, to use\r\ngranddaddy\xe2\x80\x99s words, wed her second, having killed her first.\r\n\r\nO, yes, mention there is. In the years when he was living richly in\r\nroyal London to pay a debt she had to borrow forty shillings from her\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s shepherd. Explain you then. Explain the swansong too wherein he\r\nhas commended her to posterity.\r\n\r\nHe faced their silence.\r\n\r\n     To whom thus Eglinton:\r\n     You mean the will.\r\n     But that has been explained, I believe, by jurists.\r\n     She was entitled to her widow\xe2\x80\x99s dower\r\n     At common law. His legal knowledge was great\r\n     Our judges tell us.\r\n     Him Satan fleers,\r\n     Mocker:\r\n     And therefore he left out her name\r\n     From the first draft but he did not leave out\r\n     The presents for his granddaughter, for his daughters,\r\n     For his sister, for his old cronies in Stratford\r\n     And in London. And therefore when he was urged,\r\n     As I believe, to name her\r\n     He left her his\r\n     Secondbest\r\n     Bed.\r\n\r\n     Punkt.\r\n\r\n     Leftherhis\r\n     Secondbest\r\n     Leftherhis\r\n     Bestabed\r\n     Secabest\r\n     Leftabed.\r\n\r\nWoa!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Pretty countryfolk had few chattels then, John Eglinton observed, as\r\nthey have still if our peasant plays are true to type.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94He was a rich country gentleman, Stephen said, with a coat of arms and\r\nlanded estate at Stratford and a house in Ireland yard, a capitalist\r\nshareholder, a bill promoter, a tithefarmer. Why did he not leave her\r\nhis best bed if he wished her to snore away the rest of her nights in\r\npeace?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94It is clear that there were two beds, a best and a secondbest, Mr\r\nSecondbest Best said finely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Separatio a mensa et a thalamo, bettered Buck Mulligan and was smiled\r\non.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Antiquity mentions famous beds, Second Eglinton puckered, bedsmiling.\r\nLet me think.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Antiquity mentions that Stagyrite schoolurchin and bald heathen sage,\r\nStephen said, who when dying in exile frees and endows his slaves, pays\r\ntribute to his elders, wills to be laid in earth near the bones of his\r\ndead wife and bids his friends be kind to an old mistress (don\xe2\x80\x99t forget\r\nNell Gwynn Herpyllis) and let her live in his villa.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Do you mean he died so? Mr Best asked with slight concern. I mean...\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94He died dead drunk, Buck Mulligan capped. A quart of ale is a dish for\r\na king. O, I must tell you what Dowden said!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94What? asked Besteglinton.\r\n\r\nWilliam Shakespeare and company, limited. The people\xe2\x80\x99s William. For\r\nterms apply: E. Dowden, Highfield house...\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Lovely! Buck Mulligan suspired amorously. I asked him what he thought\r\nof the charge of pederasty brought against the bard. He lifted his\r\nhands and said: All we can say is that life ran very high in those days.\r\nLovely!\r\n\r\nCatamite.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94The sense of beauty leads us astray, said beautifulinsadness Best to\r\nugling Eglinton.\r\n\r\nSteadfast John replied severe:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94The doctor can tell us what those words mean. You cannot eat your cake\r\nand have it.\r\n\r\nSayest thou so? Will they wrest from us, from me, the palm of beauty?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94And the sense of property, Stephen said. He drew Shylock out of his own\r\nlong pocket. The son of a maltjobber and moneylender he was himself a\r\ncornjobber and moneylender, with ten tods of corn hoarded in the famine\r\nriots. His borrowers are no doubt those divers of worship mentioned\r\nby Chettle Falstaff who reported his uprightness of dealing. He sued a\r\nfellowplayer for the price of a few bags of malt and exacted his pound\r\nof flesh in interest for every money lent. How else could Aubrey\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nostler and callboy get rich quick? All events brought grist to his\r\nmill. Shylock chimes with the jewbaiting that followed the hanging and\r\nquartering of the queen\xe2\x80\x99s leech Lopez, his jew\xe2\x80\x99s heart being plucked\r\nforth while the sheeny was yet alive: Hamlet and Macbeth with the coming\r\nto the throne of a Scotch philosophaster with a turn for witchroasting.\r\nThe lost armada is his jeer in Love\xe2\x80\x99s Labour Lost. His pageants,\r\nthe histories, sail fullbellied on a tide of Mafeking enthusiasm.\r\nWarwickshire jesuits are tried and we have a porter\xe2\x80\x99s theory of\r\nequivocation. The Sea Venture comes home from Bermudas and the play\r\nRenan admired is written with Patsy Caliban, our American cousin.\r\nThe sugared sonnets follow Sidney\xe2\x80\x99s. As for fay Elizabeth, otherwise\r\ncarrotty Bess, the gross virgin who inspired The Merry Wives of Windsor,\r\nlet some meinherr from Almany grope his life long for deephid meanings\r\nin the depths of the buckbasket.\r\n\r\nI think you\xe2\x80\x99re getting on very nicely. Just mix up a mixture of\r\ntheolologicophilolological. Mingo, minxi, mictum, mingere.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Prove that he was a jew, John Eglinton dared, expectantly. Your dean of\r\nstudies holds he was a holy Roman.\r\n\r\nSufflaminandus sum.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94He was made in Germany, Stephen replied, as the champion French\r\npolisher of Italian scandals.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94A myriadminded man, Mr Best reminded. Coleridge called him\r\nmyriadminded.\r\n\r\nAmplius. In societate humana hoc est maxime necessarium ut sit amicitia\r\ninter multos.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Saint Thomas, Stephen began...\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Ora pro nobis, Monk Mulligan groaned, sinking to a chair.\r\n\r\nThere he keened a wailing rune.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Pogue mahone! Acushla machree! It\xe2\x80\x99s destroyed we are from this day!\r\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s destroyed we are surely!\r\n\r\nAll smiled their smiles.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Saint Thomas, Stephen smiling said, whose gorbellied works I enjoy\r\nreading in the original, writing of incest from a standpoint different\r\nfrom that of the new Viennese school Mr Magee spoke of, likens it in his\r\nwise and curious way to an avarice of the emotions. He means that the\r\nlove so given to one near in blood is covetously withheld from some\r\nstranger who, it may be, hungers for it. Jews, whom christians tax with\r\navarice, are of all races the most given to intermarriage. Accusations\r\nare made in anger. The christian laws which built up the hoards of the\r\njews (for whom, as for the lollards, storm was shelter) bound their\r\naffections too with hoops of steel. Whether these be sins or virtues old\r\nNobodaddy will tell us at doomsday leet. But a man who holds so tightly\r\nto what he calls his rights over what he calls his debts will hold\r\ntightly also to what he calls his rights over her whom he calls his\r\nwife. No sir smile neighbour shall covet his ox or his wife or his\r\nmanservant or his maidservant or his jackass.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Or his jennyass, Buck Mulligan antiphoned.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Gentle Will is being roughly handled, gentle Mr Best said gently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Which will? gagged sweetly Buck Mulligan. We are getting mixed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94The will to live, John Eglinton philosophised, for poor Ann, Will\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwidow, is the will to die.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Requiescat! Stephen prayed.\r\n\r\n     What of all the will to do?\r\n     It has vanished long ago...\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94She lies laid out in stark stiffness in that secondbest bed, the mobled\r\nqueen, even though you prove that a bed in those days was as rare as a\r\nmotorcar is now and that its carvings were the wonder of seven parishes.\r\nIn old age she takes up with gospellers (one stayed with her at New\r\nPlace and drank a quart of sack the town council paid for but in which\r\nbed he slept it skills not to ask) and heard she had a soul. She read\r\nor had read to her his chapbooks preferring them to the Merry Wives and,\r\nloosing her nightly waters on the jordan, she thought over Hooks and\r\nEyes for Believers\xe2\x80\x99 Breeches and The most Spiritual Snuffbox to Make the\r\nMost Devout Souls Sneeze. Venus has twisted her lips in prayer. Agenbite\r\nof inwit: remorse of conscience. It is an age of exhausted whoredom\r\ngroping for its god.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94History shows that to be true, inquit Eglintonus Chronolologos. The\r\nages succeed one another. But we have it on high authority that a man\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nworst enemies shall be those of his own house and family. I feel that\r\nRussell is right. What do we care for his wife or father? I should say\r\nthat only family poets have family lives. Falstaff was not a family man.\r\nI feel that the fat knight is his supreme creation.\r\n\r\nLean, he lay back. Shy, deny thy kindred, the unco guid. Shy, supping\r\nwith the godless, he sneaks the cup. A sire in Ultonian Antrim bade it\r\nhim. Visits him here on quarter days. Mr Magee, sir, there\xe2\x80\x99s a gentleman\r\nto see you. Me? Says he\xe2\x80\x99s your father, sir. Give me my Wordsworth. Enter\r\nMagee Mor Matthew, a rugged rough rugheaded kern, in strossers with\r\na buttoned codpiece, his nether stocks bemired with clauber of ten\r\nforests, a wand of wilding in his hand.\r\n\r\nYour own? He knows your old fellow. The widower.\r\n\r\nHurrying to her squalid deathlair from gay Paris on the quayside I\r\ntouched his hand. The voice, new warmth, speaking. Dr Bob Kenny is\r\nattending her. The eyes that wish me well. But do not know me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94A father, Stephen said, battling against hopelessness, is a necessary\r\nevil. He wrote the play in the months that followed his father\xe2\x80\x99s death.\r\nIf you hold that he, a greying man with two marriageable daughters,\r\nwith thirtyfive years of life, nel mezzo del cammin di nostra vita, with\r\nfifty of experience, is the beardless undergraduate from Wittenberg then\r\nyou must hold that his seventyyear old mother is the lustful queen. No.\r\nThe corpse of John Shakespeare does not walk the night. From hour to\r\nhour it rots and rots. He rests, disarmed of fatherhood, having devised\r\nthat mystical estate upon his son. Boccaccio\xe2\x80\x99s Calandrino was the first\r\nand last man who felt himself with child. Fatherhood, in the sense of\r\nconscious begetting, is unknown to man. It is a mystical estate, an\r\napostolic succession, from only begetter to only begotten. On that\r\nmystery and not on the madonna which the cunning Italian intellect\r\nflung to the mob of Europe the church is founded and founded irremovably\r\nbecause founded, like the world, macro and microcosm, upon the void.\r\nUpon incertitude, upon unlikelihood. Amor matris, subjective and\r\nobjective genitive, may be the only true thing in life. Paternity may be\r\na legal fiction. Who is the father of any son that any son should love\r\nhim or he any son?\r\n\r\nWhat the hell are you driving at?\r\n\r\nI know. Shut up. Blast you. I have reasons.\r\n\r\nAmplius. Adhuc. Iterum. Postea.\r\n\r\nAre you condemned to do this?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94They are sundered by a bodily shame so steadfast that the criminal\r\nannals of the world, stained with all other incests and bestialities,\r\nhardly record its breach. Sons with mothers, sires with daughters,\r\nlesbic sisters, loves that dare not speak their name, nephews with\r\ngrandmothers, jailbirds with keyholes, queens with prize bulls. The son\r\nunborn mars beauty: born, he brings pain, divides affection, increases\r\ncare. He is a new male: his growth is his father\xe2\x80\x99s decline, his youth\r\nhis father\xe2\x80\x99s envy, his friend his father\xe2\x80\x99s enemy.\r\n\r\nIn rue Monsieur-le-Prince I thought it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94What links them in nature? An instant of blind rut.\r\n\r\nAm I a father? If I were?\r\n\r\nShrunken uncertain hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Sabellius, the African, subtlest heresiarch of all the beasts of the\r\nfield, held that the Father was Himself His Own Son. The bulldog of\r\nAquin, with whom no word shall be impossible, refutes him. Well: if\r\nthe father who has not a son be not a father can the son who has not a\r\nfather be a son? When Rutlandbaconsouthamptonshakespeare or another poet\r\nof the same name in the comedy of errors wrote Hamlet he was not the\r\nfather of his own son merely but, being no more a son, he was and felt\r\nhimself the father of all his race, the father of his own grandfather,\r\nthe father of his unborn grandson who, by the same token, never was\r\nborn, for nature, as Mr Magee understands her, abhors perfection.\r\n\r\nEglintoneyes, quick with pleasure, looked up shybrightly. Gladly\r\nglancing, a merry puritan, through the twisted eglantine.\r\n\r\nFlatter. Rarely. But flatter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Himself his own father, Sonmulligan told himself. Wait. I am big with\r\nchild. I have an unborn child in my brain. Pallas Athena! A play! The\r\nplay\xe2\x80\x99s the thing! Let me parturiate!\r\n\r\nHe clasped his paunchbrow with both birthaiding hands.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94As for his family, Stephen said, his mother\xe2\x80\x99s name lives in the\r\nforest of Arden. Her death brought from him the scene with Volumnia in\r\nCoriolanus. His boyson\xe2\x80\x99s death is the deathscene of young Arthur in King\r\nJohn. Hamlet, the black prince, is Hamnet Shakespeare. Who the girls in\r\nThe Tempest, in Pericles, in Winter\xe2\x80\x99s Tale are we know. Who Cleopatra,\r\nfleshpot of Egypt, and Cressid and Venus are we may guess. But there is\r\nanother member of his family who is recorded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94The plot thickens, John Eglinton said.\r\n\r\nThe quaker librarian, quaking, tiptoed in, quake, his mask, quake, with\r\nhaste, quake, quack.\r\n\r\nDoor closed. Cell. Day.\r\n\r\nThey list. Three. They.\r\n\r\nI you he they.\r\n\r\nCome, mess.\r\n\r\nSTEPHEN: He had three brothers, Gilbert, Edmund, Richard. Gilbert in his\r\nold age told some cavaliers he got a pass for nowt from Maister Gatherer\r\none time mass he did and he seen his brud Maister Wull the playwriter up\r\nin Lunnon in a wrastling play wud a man on\xe2\x80\x99s back. The playhouse sausage\r\nfilled Gilbert\xe2\x80\x99s soul. He is nowhere: but an Edmund and a Richard are\r\nrecorded in the works of sweet William.\r\n\r\nMAGEEGLINJOHN: Names! What\xe2\x80\x99s in a name?\r\n\r\nBEST: That is my name, Richard, don\xe2\x80\x99t you know. I hope you are going to\r\nsay a good word for Richard, don\xe2\x80\x99t you know, for my sake. (Laughter)\r\n\r\nBUCKMULLIGAN: (Piano, diminuendo)\r\n\r\n     Then outspoke medical Dick\r\n     To his comrade medical Davy...\r\n\r\nSTEPHEN: In his trinity of black Wills, the villain shakebags, Iago,\r\nRichard Crookback, Edmund in King Lear, two bear the wicked uncles\xe2\x80\x99\r\nnames. Nay, that last play was written or being written while his\r\nbrother Edmund lay dying in Southwark.\r\n\r\nBEST: I hope Edmund is going to catch it. I don\xe2\x80\x99t want Richard, my name\r\n...\r\n\r\n(Laughter)\r\n\r\nQUAKERLYSTER: (A tempo) But he that filches from me my good name...\r\n\r\nSTEPHEN: (Stringendo) He has hidden his own name, a fair name, William,\r\nin the plays, a super here, a clown there, as a painter of old Italy\r\nset his face in a dark corner of his canvas. He has revealed it in the\r\nsonnets where there is Will in overplus. Like John o\xe2\x80\x99Gaunt his name is\r\ndear to him, as dear as the coat and crest he toadied for, on a bend\r\nsable a spear or steeled argent, honorificabilitudinitatibus, dearer\r\nthan his glory of greatest shakescene in the country. What\xe2\x80\x99s in a name?\r\nThat is what we ask ourselves in childhood when we write the name that\r\nwe are told is ours. A star, a daystar, a firedrake, rose at his birth.\r\nIt shone by day in the heavens alone, brighter than Venus in the\r\nnight, and by night it shone over delta in Cassiopeia, the recumbent\r\nconstellation which is the signature of his initial among the stars. His\r\neyes watched it, lowlying on the horizon, eastward of the bear, as\r\nhe walked by the slumberous summer fields at midnight returning from\r\nShottery and from her arms.\r\n\r\nBoth satisfied. I too.\r\n\r\nDon\xe2\x80\x99t tell them he was nine years old when it was quenched.\r\n\r\nAnd from her arms.\r\n\r\nWait to be wooed and won. Ay, meacock. Who will woo you?\r\n\r\nRead the skies. Autontimorumenos. Bous Stephanoumenos. Where\xe2\x80\x99s your\r\nconfiguration? Stephen, Stephen, cut the bread even. S. D: sua donna.\r\nGi\xc3\xa0: di lui. Gelindo risolve di non amare S. D.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94What is that, Mr Dedalus? the quaker librarian asked. Was it a\r\ncelestial phenomenon?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94A star by night, Stephen said. A pillar of the cloud by day.\r\n\r\nWhat more\xe2\x80\x99s to speak?\r\n\r\nStephen looked on his hat, his stick, his boots.\r\n\r\nStephanos, my crown. My sword. His boots are spoiling the shape of my\r\nfeet. Buy a pair. Holes in my socks. Handkerchief too.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94You make good use of the name, John Eglinton allowed. Your own name is\r\nstrange enough. I suppose it explains your fantastical humour.\r\n\r\nMe, Magee and Mulligan.\r\n\r\nFabulous artificer. The hawklike man. You flew. Whereto?\r\nNewhaven-Dieppe, steerage passenger. Paris and back. Lapwing. Icarus.\r\nPater, ait. Seabedabbled, fallen, weltering. Lapwing you are. Lapwing\r\nbe.\r\n\r\nMr Best eagerquietly lifted his book to say:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94That\xe2\x80\x99s very interesting because that brother motive, don\xe2\x80\x99t you know, we\r\nfind also in the old Irish myths. Just what you say. The three brothers\r\nShakespeare. In Grimm too, don\xe2\x80\x99t you know, the fairytales. The third\r\nbrother that always marries the sleeping beauty and wins the best prize.\r\n\r\nBest of Best brothers. Good, better, best.\r\n\r\nThe quaker librarian springhalted near.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I should like to know, he said, which brother you... I understand you\r\nto suggest there was misconduct with one of the brothers... But perhaps\r\nI am anticipating?\r\n\r\nHe caught himself in the act: looked at all: refrained.\r\n\r\nAn attendant from the doorway called:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Mr Lyster! Father Dineen wants...\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94O, Father Dineen! Directly.\r\n\r\nSwiftly rectly creaking rectly rectly he was rectly gone.\r\n\r\nJohn Eglinton touched the foil.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Come, he said. Let us hear what you have to say of Richard and Edmund.\r\nYou kept them for the last, didn\xe2\x80\x99t you?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94In asking you to remember those two noble kinsmen nuncle Richie and\r\nnuncle Edmund, Stephen answered, I feel I am asking too much perhaps. A\r\nbrother is as easily forgotten as an umbrella.\r\n\r\nLapwing.\r\n\r\nWhere is your brother? Apothecaries\xe2\x80\x99 hall. My whetstone. Him, then\r\nCranly, Mulligan: now these. Speech, speech. But act. Act speech. They\r\nmock to try you. Act. Be acted on.\r\n\r\nLapwing.\r\n\r\nI am tired of my voice, the voice of Esau. My kingdom for a drink.\r\n\r\nOn.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94You will say those names were already in the chronicles from which he\r\ntook the stuff of his plays. Why did he take them rather than others?\r\nRichard, a whoreson crookback, misbegotten, makes love to a widowed Ann\r\n(what\xe2\x80\x99s in a name?), woos and wins her, a whoreson merry widow. Richard\r\nthe conqueror, third brother, came after William the conquered. The\r\nother four acts of that play hang limply from that first. Of all his\r\nkings Richard is the only king unshielded by Shakespeare\xe2\x80\x99s reverence,\r\nthe angel of the world. Why is the underplot of King Lear in which\r\nEdmund figures lifted out of Sidney\xe2\x80\x99s Arcadia and spatchcocked on to a\r\nCeltic legend older than history?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94That was Will\xe2\x80\x99s way, John Eglinton defended. We should not now combine\r\na Norse saga with an excerpt from a novel by George Meredith. Que\r\nvoulez-vous? Moore would say. He puts Bohemia on the seacoast and makes\r\nUlysses quote Aristotle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Why? Stephen answered himself. Because the theme of the false or\r\nthe usurping or the adulterous brother or all three in one is to\r\nShakespeare, what the poor are not, always with him. The note of\r\nbanishment, banishment from the heart, banishment from home, sounds\r\nuninterruptedly from The Two Gentlemen of Verona onward till Prospero\r\nbreaks his staff, buries it certain fathoms in the earth and drowns his\r\nbook. It doubles itself in the middle of his life, reflects itself in\r\nanother, repeats itself, protasis, epitasis, catastasis, catastrophe.\r\nIt repeats itself again when he is near the grave, when his married\r\ndaughter Susan, chip of the old block, is accused of adultery. But it\r\nwas the original sin that darkened his understanding, weakened his will\r\nand left in him a strong inclination to evil. The words are those of\r\nmy lords bishops of Maynooth. An original sin and, like original sin,\r\ncommitted by another in whose sin he too has sinned. It is between the\r\nlines of his last written words, it is petrified on his tombstone under\r\nwhich her four bones are not to be laid. Age has not withered it. Beauty\r\nand peace have not done it away. It is in infinite variety everywhere\r\nin the world he has created, in Much Ado about Nothing, twice in As you\r\nlike It, in The Tempest, in Hamlet, in Measure for Measure\xe2\x80\x94and in all\r\nthe other plays which I have not read.\r\n\r\nHe laughed to free his mind from his mind\xe2\x80\x99s bondage.\r\n\r\nJudge Eglinton summed up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94The truth is midway, he affirmed. He is the ghost and the prince. He is\r\nall in all.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94He is, Stephen said. The boy of act one is the mature man of act five.\r\nAll in all. In Cymbeline, in Othello he is bawd and cuckold. He acts and\r\nis acted on. Lover of an ideal or a perversion, like Jos\xc3\xa9 he kills the\r\nreal Carmen. His unremitting intellect is the hornmad Iago ceaselessly\r\nwilling that the moor in him shall suffer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Cuckoo! Cuckoo! Cuck Mulligan clucked lewdly. O word of fear!\r\n\r\nDark dome received, reverbed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94And what a character is Iago! undaunted John Eglinton exclaimed.\r\nWhen all is said Dumas fils (or is it Dumas p\xc3\xa8re?) is right. After God\r\nShakespeare has created most.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Man delights him not nor woman neither, Stephen said. He returns after\r\na life of absence to that spot of earth where he was born, where he has\r\nalways been, man and boy, a silent witness and there, his journey of\r\nlife ended, he plants his mulberrytree in the earth. Then dies. The\r\nmotion is ended. Gravediggers bury Hamlet p\xc3\xa8re and Hamlet fils. A king\r\nand a prince at last in death, with incidental music. And, what though\r\nmurdered and betrayed, bewept by all frail tender hearts for, Dane or\r\nDubliner, sorrow for the dead is the only husband from whom they refuse\r\nto be divorced. If you like the epilogue look long on it: prosperous\r\nProspero, the good man rewarded, Lizzie, grandpa\xe2\x80\x99s lump of love, and\r\nnuncle Richie, the bad man taken off by poetic justice to the place\r\nwhere the bad niggers go. Strong curtain. He found in the world without\r\nas actual what was in his world within as possible. Maeterlinck says:\r\nIf Socrates leave his house today he will find the sage seated on his\r\ndoorstep. If Judas go forth tonight it is to Judas his steps will tend.\r\nEvery life is many days, day after day. We walk through ourselves,\r\nmeeting robbers, ghosts, giants, old men, young men, wives, widows,\r\nbrothers-in-love, but always meeting ourselves. The playwright who wrote\r\nthe folio of this world and wrote it badly (He gave us light first and\r\nthe sun two days later), the lord of things as they are whom the most\r\nRoman of catholics call dio boia, hangman god, is doubtless all in all\r\nin all of us, ostler and butcher, and would be bawd and cuckold too but\r\nthat in the economy of heaven, foretold by Hamlet, there are no more\r\nmarriages, glorified man, an androgynous angel, being a wife unto\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Eureka! Buck Mulligan cried. Eureka!\r\n\r\nSuddenly happied he jumped up and reached in a stride John Eglinton\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndesk.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94May I? he said. The Lord has spoken to Malachi.\r\n\r\nHe began to scribble on a slip of paper.\r\n\r\nTake some slips from the counter going out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Those who are married, Mr Best, douce herald, said, all save one, shall\r\nlive. The rest shall keep as they are.\r\n\r\nHe laughed, unmarried, at Eglinton Johannes, of arts a bachelor.\r\n\r\nUnwed, unfancied, ware of wiles, they fingerponder nightly each his\r\nvariorum edition of The Taming of the Shrew.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94You are a delusion, said roundly John Eglinton to Stephen. You have\r\nbrought us all this way to show us a French triangle. Do you believe\r\nyour own theory?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94No, Stephen said promptly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Are you going to write it? Mr Best asked. You ought to make it a\r\ndialogue, don\xe2\x80\x99t you know, like the Platonic dialogues Wilde wrote.\r\n\r\nJohn Eclecticon doubly smiled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Well, in that case, he said, I don\xe2\x80\x99t see why you should expect payment\r\nfor it since you don\xe2\x80\x99t believe it yourself. Dowden believes there is\r\nsome mystery in Hamlet but will say no more. Herr Bleibtreu, the man\r\nPiper met in Berlin, who is working up that Rutland theory, believes\r\nthat the secret is hidden in the Stratford monument. He is going to\r\nvisit the present duke, Piper says, and prove to him that his ancestor\r\nwrote the plays. It will come as a surprise to his grace. But he\r\nbelieves his theory.\r\n\r\nI believe, O Lord, help my unbelief. That is, help me to believe or help\r\nme to unbelieve? Who helps to believe? Egomen. Who to unbelieve? Other\r\nchap.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94You are the only contributor to Dana who asks for pieces of silver.\r\nThen I don\xe2\x80\x99t know about the next number. Fred Ryan wants space for an\r\narticle on economics.\r\n\r\nFraidrine. Two pieces of silver he lent me. Tide you over. Economics.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94For a guinea, Stephen said, you can publish this interview.\r\n\r\nBuck Mulligan stood up from his laughing scribbling, laughing: and then\r\ngravely said, honeying malice:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I called upon the bard Kinch at his summer residence in upper\r\nMecklenburgh street and found him deep in the study of the Summa contra\r\nGentiles in the company of two gonorrheal ladies, Fresh Nelly and\r\nRosalie, the coalquay whore.\r\n\r\nHe broke away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Come, Kinch. Come, wandering \xc3\x86ngus of the birds.\r\n\r\nCome, Kinch. You have eaten all we left. Ay. I will serve you your orts\r\nand offals.\r\n\r\nStephen rose.\r\n\r\nLife is many days. This will end.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94We shall see you tonight, John Eglinton said. Notre ami Moore says\r\nMalachi Mulligan must be there.\r\n\r\nBuck Mulligan flaunted his slip and panama.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Monsieur Moore, he said, lecturer on French letters to the youth of\r\nIreland. I\xe2\x80\x99ll be there. Come, Kinch, the bards must drink. Can you walk\r\nstraight?\r\n\r\nLaughing, he...\r\n\r\nSwill till eleven. Irish nights entertainment.\r\n\r\nLubber...\r\n\r\nStephen followed a lubber...\r\n\r\nOne day in the national library we had a discussion. Shakes. After. His\r\nlub back: I followed. I gall his kibe.\r\n\r\nStephen, greeting, then all amort, followed a lubber jester, a wellkempt\r\nhead, newbarbered, out of the vaulted cell into a shattering daylight of\r\nno thought.\r\n\r\nWhat have I learned? Of them? Of me?\r\n\r\nWalk like Haines now.\r\n\r\nThe constant readers\xe2\x80\x99 room. In the readers\xe2\x80\x99 book Cashel Boyle O\xe2\x80\x99Connor\r\nFitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell parafes his polysyllables. Item: was Hamlet\r\nmad? The quaker\xe2\x80\x99s pate godlily with a priesteen in booktalk.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94O please do, sir... I shall be most pleased...\r\n\r\nAmused Buck Mulligan mused in pleasant murmur with himself, selfnodding:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94A pleased bottom.\r\n\r\nThe turnstile.\r\n\r\nIs that?... Blueribboned hat... Idly writing... What? Looked?...\r\n\r\nThe curving balustrade: smoothsliding Mincius.\r\n\r\nPuck Mulligan, panamahelmeted, went step by step, iambing, trolling:\r\n\r\n      John Eglinton, my jo, John,\r\n      Why won\xe2\x80\x99t you wed a wife?\r\n\r\nHe spluttered to the air:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94O, the chinless Chinaman! Chin Chon Eg Lin Ton. We went over to their\r\nplaybox, Haines and I, the plumbers\xe2\x80\x99 hall. Our players are creating a\r\nnew art for Europe like the Greeks or M. Maeterlinck. Abbey Theatre! I\r\nsmell the pubic sweat of monks.\r\n\r\nHe spat blank.\r\n\r\nForgot: any more than he forgot the whipping lousy Lucy gave him. And\r\nleft the femme de trente ans. And why no other children born? And his\r\nfirst child a girl?\r\n\r\nAfterwit. Go back.\r\n\r\nThe dour recluse still there (he has his cake) and the douce youngling,\r\nminion of pleasure, Phedo\xe2\x80\x99s toyable fair hair.\r\n\r\nEh... I just eh... wanted... I forgot... he...\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Longworth and M\xe2\x80\x99Curdy Atkinson were there...\r\n\r\nPuck Mulligan footed featly, trilling:\r\n\r\n     I hardly hear the purlieu cry\r\n     Or a Tommy talk as I pass one by\r\n     Before my thoughts begin to run\r\n     On F. M\xe2\x80\x99Curdy Atkinson,\r\n     The same that had the wooden leg\r\n     And that filibustering filibeg\r\n     That never dared to slake his drouth,\r\n     Magee that had the chinless mouth.\r\n     Being afraid to marry on earth\r\n     They masturbated for all they were worth.\r\n\r\nJest on. Know thyself.\r\n\r\nHalted, below me, a quizzer looks at me. I halt.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Mournful mummer, Buck Mulligan moaned. Synge has left off wearing black\r\nto be like nature. Only crows, priests and English coal are black.\r\n\r\nA laugh tripped over his lips.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Longworth is awfully sick, he said, after what you wrote about that old\r\nhake Gregory. O you inquisitional drunken jewjesuit! She gets you a job\r\non the paper and then you go and slate her drivel to Jaysus. Couldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nyou do the Yeats touch?\r\n\r\nHe went on and down, mopping, chanting with waving graceful arms:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94The most beautiful book that has come out of our country in my time.\r\nOne thinks of Homer.\r\n\r\nHe stopped at the stairfoot.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I have conceived a play for the mummers, he said solemnly.\r\n\r\nThe pillared Moorish hall, shadows entwined. Gone the nine men\xe2\x80\x99s morrice\r\nwith caps of indices.\r\n\r\nIn sweetly varying voices Buck Mulligan read his tablet:\r\n\r\n      Everyman His Own Wife\r\n      or\r\n      A Honeymoon in the Hand\r\n      (a national immorality in three orgasms)\r\n      by\r\n      Ballocky Mulligan.\r\n\r\nHe turned a happy patch\xe2\x80\x99s smirk to Stephen, saying:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94The disguise, I fear, is thin. But listen.\r\n\r\nHe read, marcato:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Characters:\r\n\r\n     TODY TOSTOFF (a ruined Pole)\r\n     CRAB (a bushranger)\r\n     MEDICAL DICK )\r\n     and          ) (two birds with one stone)\r\n     MEDICAL DAVY )\r\n     MOTHER GROGAN (a watercarrier)\r\n     FRESH NELLY\r\n     and\r\n     ROSALIE (the coalquay whore).\r\n\r\nHe laughed, lolling a to and fro head, walking on, followed by Stephen:\r\nand mirthfully he told the shadows, souls of men:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94O, the night in the Camden hall when the daughters of Erin had to\r\nlift their skirts to step over you as you lay in your mulberrycoloured,\r\nmulticoloured, multitudinous vomit!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94The most innocent son of Erin, Stephen said, for whom they ever lifted\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nAbout to pass through the doorway, feeling one behind, he stood aside.\r\n\r\nPart. The moment is now. Where then? If Socrates leave his house today,\r\nif Judas go forth tonight. Why? That lies in space which I in time must\r\ncome to, ineluctably.\r\n\r\nMy will: his will that fronts me. Seas between.\r\n\r\nA man passed out between them, bowing, greeting.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Good day again, Buck Mulligan said.\r\n\r\nThe portico.\r\n\r\nHere I watched the birds for augury. \xc3\x86ngus of the birds. They go, they\r\ncome. Last night I flew. Easily flew. Men wondered. Street of harlots\r\nafter. A creamfruit melon he held to me. In. You will see.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94The wandering jew, Buck Mulligan whispered with clown\xe2\x80\x99s awe. Did you\r\nsee his eye? He looked upon you to lust after you. I fear thee, ancient\r\nmariner. O, Kinch, thou art in peril. Get thee a breechpad.\r\n\r\nManner of Oxenford.\r\n\r\nDay. Wheelbarrow sun over arch of bridge.\r\n\r\nA dark back went before them, step of a pard, down, out by the gateway,\r\nunder portcullis barbs.\r\n\r\nThey followed.\r\n\r\nOffend me still. Speak on.\r\n\r\nKind air defined the coigns of houses in Kildare street. No birds. Frail\r\nfrom the housetops two plumes of smoke ascended, pluming, and in a flaw\r\nof softness softly were blown.\r\n\r\nCease to strive. Peace of the druid priests of Cymbeline: hierophantic:\r\nfrom wide earth an altar.\r\n\r\n     Laud we the gods\r\n     And let our crooked smokes climb to their nostrils\r\n     From our bless\xe2\x80\x99d altars.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[ 10 ]\r\n\r\nThe superior, the very reverend John Conmee S. J. reset his smooth watch\r\nin his interior pocket as he came down the presbytery steps. Five to\r\nthree. Just nice time to walk to Artane. What was that boy\xe2\x80\x99s name again?\r\nDignam. Yes. Vere dignum et iustum est. Brother Swan was the person\r\nto see. Mr Cunningham\xe2\x80\x99s letter. Yes. Oblige him, if possible. Good\r\npractical catholic: useful at mission time.\r\n\r\nA onelegged sailor, swinging himself onward by lazy jerks of his\r\ncrutches, growled some notes. He jerked short before the convent of the\r\nsisters of charity and held out a peaked cap for alms towards the very\r\nreverend John Conmee S. J. Father Conmee blessed him in the sun for his\r\npurse held, he knew, one silver crown.\r\n\r\nFather Conmee crossed to Mountjoy square. He thought, but not for long,\r\nof soldiers and sailors, whose legs had been shot off by cannonballs,\r\nending their days in some pauper ward, and of cardinal Wolsey\xe2\x80\x99s words:\r\nIf I had served my God as I have served my king He would not have\r\nabandoned me in my old days. He walked by the treeshade of sunnywinking\r\nleaves: and towards him came the wife of Mr David Sheehy M.P.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Very well, indeed, father. And you, father?\r\n\r\nFather Conmee was wonderfully well indeed. He would go to Buxton\r\nprobably for the waters. And her boys, were they getting on well at\r\nBelvedere? Was that so? Father Conmee was very glad indeed to hear that.\r\nAnd Mr Sheehy himself? Still in London. The house was still sitting, to\r\nbe sure it was. Beautiful weather it was, delightful indeed. Yes, it was\r\nvery probable that Father Bernard Vaughan would come again to preach. O,\r\nyes: a very great success. A wonderful man really.\r\n\r\nFather Conmee was very glad to see the wife of Mr David Sheehy M.P.\r\nIooking so well and he begged to be remembered to Mr David Sheehy M.P.\r\nYes, he would certainly call.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Good afternoon, Mrs Sheehy.\r\n\r\nFather Conmee doffed his silk hat and smiled, as he took leave, at the\r\njet beads of her mantilla inkshining in the sun. And smiled yet again,\r\nin going. He had cleaned his teeth, he knew, with arecanut paste.\r\n\r\nFather Conmee walked and, walking, smiled for he thought on Father\r\nBernard Vaughan\xe2\x80\x99s droll eyes and cockney voice.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Pilate! Wy don\xe2\x80\x99t you old back that owlin mob?\r\n\r\nA zealous man, however. Really he was. And really did great good in his\r\nway. Beyond a doubt. He loved Ireland, he said, and he loved the Irish.\r\nOf good family too would one think it? Welsh, were they not?\r\n\r\nO, lest he forget. That letter to father provincial.\r\n\r\nFather Conmee stopped three little schoolboys at the corner of Mountjoy\r\nsquare. Yes: they were from Belvedere. The little house. Aha. And were\r\nthey good boys at school? O. That was very good now. And what was his\r\nname? Jack Sohan. And his name? Ger. Gallaher. And the other little man?\r\nHis name was Brunny Lynam. O, that was a very nice name to have.\r\n\r\nFather Conmee gave a letter from his breast to Master Brunny Lynam and\r\npointed to the red pillarbox at the corner of Fitzgibbon street.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94But mind you don\xe2\x80\x99t post yourself into the box, little man, he said.\r\n\r\nThe boys sixeyed Father Conmee and laughed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94O, sir.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Well, let me see if you can post a letter, Father Conmee said.\r\n\r\nMaster Brunny Lynam ran across the road and put Father Conmee\xe2\x80\x99s letter\r\nto father provincial into the mouth of the bright red letterbox. Father\r\nConmee smiled and nodded and smiled and walked along Mountjoy square\r\neast.\r\n\r\nMr Denis J Maginni, professor of dancing &c, in silk hat, slate\r\nfrockcoat with silk facings, white kerchief tie, tight lavender\r\ntrousers, canary gloves and pointed patent boots, walking with grave\r\ndeportment most respectfully took the curbstone as he passed lady\r\nMaxwell at the corner of Dignam\xe2\x80\x99s court.\r\n\r\nWas that not Mrs M\xe2\x80\x99Guinness?\r\n\r\nMrs M\xe2\x80\x99Guinness, stately, silverhaired, bowed to Father Conmee from the\r\nfarther footpath along which she sailed. And Father Conmee smiled and\r\nsaluted. How did she do?\r\n\r\nA fine carriage she had. Like Mary, queen of Scots, something. And to\r\nthink that she was a pawnbroker! Well, now! Such a... what should he\r\nsay?... such a queenly mien.\r\n\r\nFather Conmee walked down Great Charles street and glanced at the shutup\r\nfree church on his left. The reverend T. R. Greene B.A. will (D.V.)\r\nspeak. The incumbent they called him. He felt it incumbent on him to say\r\na few words. But one should be charitable. Invincible ignorance. They\r\nacted according to their lights.\r\n\r\nFather Conmee turned the corner and walked along the North Circular\r\nroad. It was a wonder that there was not a tramline in such an important\r\nthoroughfare. Surely, there ought to be.\r\n\r\nA band of satchelled schoolboys crossed from Richmond street. All\r\nraised untidy caps. Father Conmee greeted them more than once benignly.\r\nChristian brother boys.\r\n\r\nFather Conmee smelt incense on his right hand as he walked. Saint\r\nJoseph\xe2\x80\x99s church, Portland row. For aged and virtuous females.\r\nFather Conmee raised his hat to the Blessed Sacrament. Virtuous: but\r\noccasionally they were also badtempered.\r\n\r\nNear Aldborough house Father Conmee thought of that spendthrift\r\nnobleman. And now it was an office or something.\r\n\r\nFather Conmee began to walk along the North Strand road and was saluted\r\nby Mr William Gallagher who stood in the doorway of his shop. Father\r\nConmee saluted Mr William Gallagher and perceived the odours that came\r\nfrom baconflitches and ample cools of butter. He passed Grogan\xe2\x80\x99s the\r\nTobacconist against which newsboards leaned and told of a dreadful\r\ncatastrophe in New York. In America those things were continually\r\nhappening. Unfortunate people to die like that, unprepared. Still, an\r\nact of perfect contrition.\r\n\r\nFather Conmee went by Daniel Bergin\xe2\x80\x99s publichouse against the window of\r\nwhich two unlabouring men lounged. They saluted him and were saluted.\r\n\r\nFather Conmee passed H. J. O\xe2\x80\x99Neill\xe2\x80\x99s funeral establishment where Corny\r\nKelleher totted figures in the daybook while he chewed a blade of hay.\r\nA constable on his beat saluted Father Conmee and Father Conmee saluted\r\nthe constable. In Youkstetter\xe2\x80\x99s, the porkbutcher\xe2\x80\x99s, Father Conmee\r\nobserved pig\xe2\x80\x99s puddings, white and black and red, lie neatly curled in\r\ntubes.\r\n\r\nMoored under the trees of Charleville Mall Father Conmee saw a\r\nturfbarge, a towhorse with pendent head, a bargeman with a hat of dirty\r\nstraw seated amidships, smoking and staring at a branch of poplar above\r\nhim. It was idyllic: and Father Conmee reflected on the providence of\r\nthe Creator who had made turf to be in bogs whence men might dig it\r\nout and bring it to town and hamlet to make fires in the houses of poor\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nOn Newcomen bridge the very reverend John Conmee S. J. of saint Francis\r\nXavier\xe2\x80\x99s church, upper Gardiner street, stepped on to an outward bound\r\ntram.\r\n\r\nOff an inward bound tram stepped the reverend Nicholas Dudley C. C. of\r\nsaint Agatha\xe2\x80\x99s church, north William street, on to Newcomen bridge.\r\n\r\nAt Newcomen bridge Father Conmee stepped into an outward bound tram for\r\nhe disliked to traverse on foot the dingy way past Mud Island.\r\n\r\nFather Conmee sat in a corner of the tramcar, a blue ticket tucked with\r\ncare in the eye of one plump kid glove, while four shillings, a sixpence\r\nand five pennies chuted from his other plump glovepalm into his purse.\r\nPassing the ivy church he reflected that the ticket inspector usually\r\nmade his visit when one had carelessly thrown away the ticket. The\r\nsolemnity of the occupants of the car seemed to Father Conmee excessive\r\nfor a journey so short and cheap. Father Conmee liked cheerful decorum.\r\n\r\nIt was a peaceful day. The gentleman with the glasses opposite Father\r\nConmee had finished explaining and looked down. His wife, Father Conmee\r\nsupposed. A tiny yawn opened the mouth of the wife of the gentleman with\r\nthe glasses. She raised her small gloved fist, yawned ever so gently,\r\ntiptapping her small gloved fist on her opening mouth and smiled tinily,\r\nsweetly.\r\n\r\nFather Conmee perceived her perfume in the car. He perceived also that\r\nthe awkward man at the other side of her was sitting on the edge of the\r\nseat.\r\n\r\nFather Conmee at the altarrails placed the host with difficulty in the\r\nmouth of the awkward old man who had the shaky head.\r\n\r\nAt Annesley bridge the tram halted and, when it was about to go, an old\r\nwoman rose suddenly from her place to alight. The conductor pulled the\r\nbellstrap to stay the car for her. She passed out with her basket and\r\na marketnet: and Father Conmee saw the conductor help her and net and\r\nbasket down: and Father Conmee thought that, as she had nearly passed\r\nthe end of the penny fare, she was one of those good souls who had\r\nalways to be told twice bless you, my child, that they have been\r\nabsolved, pray for me. But they had so many worries in life, so many\r\ncares, poor creatures.\r\n\r\nFrom the hoardings Mr Eugene Stratton grimaced with thick niggerlips at\r\nFather Conmee.\r\n\r\nFather Conmee thought of the souls of black and brown and yellow men and\r\nof his sermon on saint Peter Claver S. J. and the African mission and of\r\nthe propagation of the faith and of the millions of black and brown and\r\nyellow souls that had not received the baptism of water when their last\r\nhour came like a thief in the night. That book by the Belgian jesuit, Le\r\nNombre des \xc3\x89lus, seemed to Father Conmee a reasonable plea. Those were\r\nmillions of human souls created by God in His Own likeness to whom the\r\nfaith had not (D.V.) been brought. But they were God\xe2\x80\x99s souls, created by\r\nGod. It seemed to Father Conmee a pity that they should all be lost, a\r\nwaste, if one might say.\r\n\r\nAt the Howth road stop Father Conmee alighted, was saluted by the\r\nconductor and saluted in his turn.\r\n\r\nThe Malahide road was quiet. It pleased Father Conmee, road and name.\r\nThe joybells were ringing in gay Malahide. Lord Talbot de Malahide,\r\nimmediate hereditary lord admiral of Malahide and the seas adjoining.\r\nThen came the call to arms and she was maid, wife and widow in one day.\r\nThose were old worldish days, loyal times in joyous townlands, old times\r\nin the barony.\r\n\r\nFather Conmee, walking, thought of his little book Old Times in the\r\nBarony and of the book that might be written about jesuit houses and of\r\nMary Rochfort, daughter of lord Molesworth, first countess of Belvedere.\r\n\r\nA listless lady, no more young, walked alone the shore of lough Ennel,\r\nMary, first countess of Belvedere, listlessly walking in the evening,\r\nnot startled when an otter plunged. Who could know the truth? Not the\r\njealous lord Belvedere and not her confessor if she had not committed\r\nadultery fully, eiaculatio seminis inter vas naturale mulieris, with her\r\nhusband\xe2\x80\x99s brother? She would half confess if she had not all sinned as\r\nwomen did. Only God knew and she and he, her husband\xe2\x80\x99s brother.\r\n\r\nFather Conmee thought of that tyrannous incontinence, needed however for\r\nman\xe2\x80\x99s race on earth, and of the ways of God which were not our ways.\r\n\r\nDon John Conmee walked and moved in times of yore. He was humane and\r\nhonoured there. He bore in mind secrets confessed and he smiled at\r\nsmiling noble faces in a beeswaxed drawingroom, ceiled with full fruit\r\nclusters. And the hands of a bride and of a bridegroom, noble to noble,\r\nwere impalmed by Don John Conmee.\r\n\r\nIt was a charming day.\r\n\r\nThe lychgate of a field showed Father Conmee breadths of cabbages,\r\ncurtseying to him with ample underleaves. The sky showed him a flock\r\nof small white clouds going slowly down the wind. Moutonner, the French\r\nsaid. A just and homely word.\r\n\r\nFather Conmee, reading his office, watched a flock of muttoning clouds\r\nover Rathcoffey. His thinsocked ankles were tickled by the stubble of\r\nClongowes field. He walked there, reading in the evening, and heard\r\nthe cries of the boys\xe2\x80\x99 lines at their play, young cries in the quiet\r\nevening. He was their rector: his reign was mild.\r\n\r\nFather Conmee drew off his gloves and took his rededged breviary out. An\r\nivory bookmark told him the page.\r\n\r\nNones. He should have read that before lunch. But lady Maxwell had come.\r\n\r\nFather Conmee read in secret Pater and Ave and crossed his breast. Deus\r\nin adiutorium.\r\n\r\nHe walked calmly and read mutely the nones, walking and reading till he\r\ncame to Res in Beati immaculati: Principium verborum tuorum veritas: in\r\neternum omnia iudicia iustiti\xc3\xa6 tu\xc3\xa6.\r\n\r\nA flushed young man came from a gap of a hedge and after him came a\r\nyoung woman with wild nodding daisies in her hand. The young man raised\r\nhis cap abruptly: the young woman abruptly bent and with slow care\r\ndetached from her light skirt a clinging twig.\r\n\r\nFather Conmee blessed both gravely and turned a thin page of his\r\nbreviary. Sin: Principes persecuti sunt me gratis: et a verbis tuis\r\nformidavit cor meum.\r\n\r\nCorny Kelleher closed his long daybook and glanced with his drooping eye\r\nat a pine coffinlid sentried in a corner. He pulled himself erect,\r\nwent to it and, spinning it on its axle, viewed its shape and brass\r\nfurnishings. Chewing his blade of hay he laid the coffinlid by and came\r\nto the doorway. There he tilted his hatbrim to give shade to his eyes\r\nand leaned against the doorcase, looking idly out.\r\n\r\nFather John Conmee stepped into the Dollymount tram on Newcomen bridge.\r\n\r\nCorny Kelleher locked his largefooted boots and gazed, his hat\r\ndowntilted, chewing his blade of hay.\r\n\r\nConstable 57C, on his beat, stood to pass the time of day.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94That\xe2\x80\x99s a fine day, Mr Kelleher.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Ay, Corny Kelleher said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94It\xe2\x80\x99s very close, the constable said.\r\n\r\nCorny Kelleher sped a silent jet of hayjuice arching from his mouth\r\nwhile a generous white arm from a window in Eccles street flung forth a\r\ncoin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94What\xe2\x80\x99s the best news? he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I seen that particular party last evening, the constable said with\r\nbated breath.\r\n\r\nA onelegged sailor crutched himself round MacConnell\xe2\x80\x99s corner, skirting\r\nRabaiotti\xe2\x80\x99s icecream car, and jerked himself up Eccles street. Towards\r\nLarry O\xe2\x80\x99Rourke, in shirtsleeves in his doorway, he growled unamiably:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94For England...\r\n\r\nHe swung himself violently forward past Katey and Boody Dedalus, halted\r\nand growled:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94home and beauty.\r\n\r\nJ. J. O\xe2\x80\x99Molloy\xe2\x80\x99s white careworn face was told that Mr Lambert was in the\r\nwarehouse with a visitor.\r\n\r\nA stout lady stopped, took a copper coin from her purse and dropped it\r\ninto the cap held out to her. The sailor grumbled thanks, glanced sourly\r\nat the unheeding windows, sank his head and swung himself forward four\r\nstrides.\r\n\r\nHe halted and growled angrily:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94For England...\r\n\r\nTwo barefoot urchins, sucking long liquorice laces, halted near him,\r\ngaping at his stump with their yellowslobbered mouths.\r\n\r\nHe swung himself forward in vigorous jerks, halted, lifted his head\r\ntowards a window and bayed deeply:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94home and beauty.\r\n\r\nThe gay sweet chirping whistling within went on a bar or two, ceased.\r\nThe blind of the window was drawn aside. A card Unfurnished Apartments\r\nslipped from the sash and fell. A plump bare generous arm shone, was\r\nseen, held forth from a white petticoatbodice and taut shiftstraps. A\r\nwoman\xe2\x80\x99s hand flung forth a coin over the area railings. It fell on the\r\npath.\r\n\r\nOne of the urchins ran to it, picked it up and dropped it into the\r\nminstrel\xe2\x80\x99s cap, saying:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94There, sir.\r\n\r\nKatey and Boody Dedalus shoved in the door of the closesteaming kitchen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Did you put in the books? Boody asked.\r\n\r\nMaggy at the range rammed down a greyish mass beneath bubbling suds\r\ntwice with her potstick and wiped her brow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94They wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t give anything on them, she said.\r\n\r\nFather Conmee walked through Clongowes fields, his thinsocked ankles\r\ntickled by stubble.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Where did you try? Boody asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94M\xe2\x80\x99Guinness\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\nBoody stamped her foot and threw her satchel on the table.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Bad cess to her big face! she cried.\r\n\r\nKatey went to the range and peered with squinting eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94What\xe2\x80\x99s in the pot? she asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Shirts, Maggy said.\r\n\r\nBoody cried angrily:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Crickey, is there nothing for us to eat?\r\n\r\nKatey, lifting the kettlelid in a pad of her stained skirt, asked:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94And what\xe2\x80\x99s in this?\r\n\r\nA heavy fume gushed in answer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Peasoup, Maggy said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Where did you get it? Katey asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Sister Mary Patrick, Maggy said.\r\n\r\nThe lacquey rang his bell.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Barang!\r\n\r\nBoody sat down at the table and said hungrily:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Give us it here.\r\n\r\nMaggy poured yellow thick soup from the kettle into a bowl. Katey,\r\nsitting opposite Boody, said quietly, as her fingertip lifted to her\r\nmouth random crumbs:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94A good job we have that much. Where\xe2\x80\x99s Dilly?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Gone to meet father, Maggy said.\r\n\r\nBoody, breaking big chunks of bread into the yellow soup, added:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Our father who art not in heaven.\r\n\r\nMaggy, pouring yellow soup in Katey\xe2\x80\x99s bowl, exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Boody! For shame!\r\n\r\nA skiff, a crumpled throwaway, Elijah is coming, rode lightly down the\r\nLiffey, under Loopline bridge, shooting the rapids where water chafed\r\naround the bridgepiers, sailing eastward past hulls and anchorchains,\r\nbetween the Customhouse old dock and George\xe2\x80\x99s quay.\r\n\r\nThe blond girl in Thornton\xe2\x80\x99s bedded the wicker basket with rustling\r\nfibre. Blazes Boylan handed her the bottle swathed in pink tissue paper\r\nand a small jar.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Put these in first, will you? he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Yes, sir, the blond girl said. And the fruit on top.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94That\xe2\x80\x99ll do, game ball, Blazes Boylan said.\r\n\r\nShe bestowed fat pears neatly, head by tail, and among them ripe\r\nshamefaced peaches.\r\n\r\nBlazes Boylan walked here and there in new tan shoes about the\r\nfruitsmelling shop, lifting fruits, young juicy crinkled and plump red\r\ntomatoes, sniffing smells.\r\n\r\nH. E. L. Y.\xe2\x80\x98S filed before him, tallwhitehatted, past Tangier lane,\r\nplodding towards their goal.\r\n\r\nHe turned suddenly from a chip of strawberries, drew a gold watch from\r\nhis fob and held it at its chain\xe2\x80\x99s length.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Can you send them by tram? Now?\r\n\r\nA darkbacked figure under Merchants\xe2\x80\x99 arch scanned books on the hawker\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncart.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Certainly, sir. Is it in the city?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94O, yes, Blazes Boylan said. Ten minutes.\r\n\r\nThe blond girl handed him a docket and pencil.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Will you write the address, sir?\r\n\r\nBlazes Boylan at the counter wrote and pushed the docket to her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Send it at once, will you? he said. It\xe2\x80\x99s for an invalid.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Yes, sir. I will, sir.\r\n\r\nBlazes Boylan rattled merry money in his trousers\xe2\x80\x99 pocket.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94What\xe2\x80\x99s the damage? he asked.\r\n\r\nThe blond girl\xe2\x80\x99s slim fingers reckoned the fruits.\r\n\r\nBlazes Boylan looked into the cut of her blouse. A young pullet. He took\r\na red carnation from the tall stemglass.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94This for me? he asked gallantly.\r\n\r\nThe blond girl glanced sideways at him, got up regardless, with his tie\r\na bit crooked, blushing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Yes, sir, she said.\r\n\r\nBending archly she reckoned again fat pears and blushing peaches.\r\n\r\nBlazes Boylan looked in her blouse with more favour, the stalk of the\r\nred flower between his smiling teeth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94May I say a word to your telephone, missy? he asked roguishly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Ma! Almidano Artifoni said.\r\n\r\nHe gazed over Stephen\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder at Goldsmith\xe2\x80\x99s knobby poll.\r\n\r\nTwo carfuls of tourists passed slowly, their women sitting fore,\r\ngripping the handrests. Palefaces. Men\xe2\x80\x99s arms frankly round their\r\nstunted forms. They looked from Trinity to the blind columned porch of\r\nthe bank of Ireland where pigeons roocoocooed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Anch\xe2\x80\x99io ho avuto di queste idee, Almidano Artifoni said, quand\xe2\x80\x99 ero\r\ngiovine come Lei. Eppoi mi sono convinto che il mondo \xc3\xa8 una bestia.\r\n\xc3\x88 peccato. Perch\xc3\xa8 la sua voce... sarebbe un cespite di rendita, via.\r\nInvece, Lei si sacrifica.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Sacrifizio incruento, Stephen said smiling, swaying his ashplant in\r\nslow swingswong from its midpoint, lightly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Speriamo, the round mustachioed face said pleasantly. Ma, dia retta a\r\nme. Ci rifletta.\r\n\r\nBy the stern stone hand of Grattan, bidding halt, an Inchicore tram\r\nunloaded straggling Highland soldiers of a band.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Ci rifletter\xc3\xb2, Stephen said, glancing down the solid trouserleg.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Ma, sul serio, eh? Almidano Artifoni said.\r\n\r\nHis heavy hand took Stephen\xe2\x80\x99s firmly. Human eyes. They gazed curiously\r\nan instant and turned quickly towards a Dalkey tram.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Eccolo, Almidano Artifoni said in friendly haste. Venga a trovarmi e ci\r\npensi. Addio, caro.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Arrivederla, maestro, Stephen said, raising his hat when his hand was\r\nfreed. E grazie.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Di che? Almidano Artifoni said. Scusi, eh? Tante belle cose!\r\n\r\nAlmidano Artifoni, holding up a baton of rolled music as a signal,\r\ntrotted on stout trousers after the Dalkey tram. In vain he trotted,\r\nsignalling in vain among the rout of barekneed gillies smuggling\r\nimplements of music through Trinity gates.\r\n\r\nMiss Dunne hid the Capel street library copy of The Woman in White\r\nfar back in her drawer and rolled a sheet of gaudy notepaper into her\r\ntypewriter.\r\n\r\nToo much mystery business in it. Is he in love with that one, Marion?\r\nChange it and get another by Mary Cecil Haye.\r\n\r\nThe disk shot down the groove, wobbled a while, ceased and ogled them:\r\nsix.\r\n\r\nMiss Dunne clicked on the keyboard:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x9416 June 1904.\r\n\r\nFive tallwhitehatted sandwichmen between Monypeny\xe2\x80\x99s corner and the slab\r\nwhere Wolfe Tone\xe2\x80\x99s statue was not, eeled themselves turning H. E. L.\r\nY.\xe2\x80\x98S and plodded back as they had come.\r\n\r\nThen she stared at the large poster of Marie Kendall, charming\r\nsoubrette, and, listlessly lolling, scribbled on the jotter sixteens and\r\ncapital esses. Mustard hair and dauby cheeks. She\xe2\x80\x99s not nicelooking,\r\nis she? The way she\xe2\x80\x99s holding up her bit of a skirt. Wonder will that\r\nfellow be at the band tonight. If I could get that dressmaker to make a\r\nconcertina skirt like Susy Nagle\xe2\x80\x99s. They kick out grand. Shannon and\r\nall the boatclub swells never took his eyes off her. Hope to goodness he\r\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t keep me here till seven.\r\n\r\nThe telephone rang rudely by her ear.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Hello. Yes, sir. No, sir. Yes, sir. I\xe2\x80\x99ll ring them up after five. Only\r\nthose two, sir, for Belfast and Liverpool. All right, sir. Then I can go\r\nafter six if you\xe2\x80\x99re not back. A quarter after. Yes, sir. Twentyseven and\r\nsix. I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell him. Yes: one, seven, six.\r\n\r\nShe scribbled three figures on an envelope.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Mr Boylan! Hello! That gentleman from Sport was in looking for you. Mr\r\nLenehan, yes. He said he\xe2\x80\x99ll be in the Ormond at four. No, sir. Yes, sir.\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll ring them up after five.\r\n\r\nTwo pink faces turned in the flare of the tiny torch.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Who\xe2\x80\x99s that? Ned Lambert asked. Is that Crotty?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Ringabella and Crosshaven, a voice replied groping for foothold.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Hello, Jack, is that yourself? Ned Lambert said, raising in salute his\r\npliant lath among the flickering arches. Come on. Mind your steps there.\r\n\r\nThe vesta in the clergyman\xe2\x80\x99s uplifted hand consumed itself in a long\r\nsoft flame and was let fall. At their feet its red speck died: and\r\nmouldy air closed round them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94How interesting! a refined accent said in the gloom.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Yes, sir, Ned Lambert said heartily. We are standing in the historic\r\ncouncil chamber of saint Mary\xe2\x80\x99s abbey where silken Thomas proclaimed\r\nhimself a rebel in 1534. This is the most historic spot in all Dublin.\r\nO\xe2\x80\x99Madden Burke is going to write something about it one of these days.\r\nThe old bank of Ireland was over the way till the time of the union and\r\nthe original jews\xe2\x80\x99 temple was here too before they built their synagogue\r\nover in Adelaide road. You were never here before, Jack, were you?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94No, Ned.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94He rode down through Dame walk, the refined accent said, if my memory\r\nserves me. The mansion of the Kildares was in Thomas court.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94That\xe2\x80\x99s right, Ned Lambert said. That\xe2\x80\x99s quite right, sir.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94If you will be so kind then, the clergyman said, the next time to allow\r\nme perhaps...\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Certainly, Ned Lambert said. Bring the camera whenever you like. I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nget those bags cleared away from the windows. You can take it from here\r\nor from here.\r\n\r\nIn the still faint light he moved about, tapping with his lath the piled\r\nseedbags and points of vantage on the floor.\r\n\r\nFrom a long face a beard and gaze hung on a chessboard.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99m deeply obliged, Mr Lambert, the clergyman said. I won\xe2\x80\x99t trespass on\r\nyour valuable time...\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94You\xe2\x80\x99re welcome, sir, Ned Lambert said. Drop in whenever you like. Next\r\nweek, say. Can you see?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Yes, yes. Good afternoon, Mr Lambert. Very pleased to have met you.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Pleasure is mine, sir, Ned Lambert answered.\r\n\r\nHe followed his guest to the outlet and then whirled his lath away among\r\nthe pillars. With J. J. O\xe2\x80\x99Molloy he came forth slowly into Mary\xe2\x80\x99s abbey\r\nwhere draymen were loading floats with sacks of carob and palmnut meal,\r\nO\xe2\x80\x99Connor, Wexford.\r\n\r\nHe stood to read the card in his hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94The reverend Hugh C. Love, Rathcoffey. Present address: Saint\r\nMichael\xe2\x80\x99s, Sallins. Nice young chap he is. He\xe2\x80\x99s writing a book about the\r\nFitzgeralds he told me. He\xe2\x80\x99s well up in history, faith.\r\n\r\nThe young woman with slow care detached from her light skirt a clinging\r\ntwig.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I thought you were at a new gunpowder plot, J. J. O\xe2\x80\x99Molloy said.\r\n\r\nNed Lambert cracked his fingers in the air.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94God! he cried. I forgot to tell him that one about the earl of Kildare\r\nafter he set fire to Cashel cathedral. You know that one? I\xe2\x80\x99m bloody\r\nsorry I did it, says he, but I declare to God I thought the archbishop\r\nwas inside. He mightn\xe2\x80\x99t like it, though. What? God, I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell him\r\nanyhow. That was the great earl, the Fitzgerald Mor. Hot members they\r\nwere all of them, the Geraldines.\r\n\r\nThe horses he passed started nervously under their slack harness. He\r\nslapped a piebald haunch quivering near him and cried:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Woa, sonny!\r\n\r\nHe turned to J. J. O\xe2\x80\x99Molloy and asked:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Well, Jack. What is it? What\xe2\x80\x99s the trouble? Wait awhile. Hold hard.\r\n\r\nWith gaping mouth and head far back he stood still and, after an\r\ninstant, sneezed loudly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Chow! he said. Blast you!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94The dust from those sacks, J. J. O\xe2\x80\x99Molloy said politely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94No, Ned Lambert gasped, I caught a... cold night before... blast your\r\nsoul... night before last... and there was a hell of a lot of draught...\r\n\r\nHe held his handkerchief ready for the coming...\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I was... Glasnevin this morning... poor little... what do you call\r\nhim... Chow!... Mother of Moses!\r\n\r\nTom Rochford took the top disk from the pile he clasped against his\r\nclaret waistcoat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94See? he said. Say it\xe2\x80\x99s turn six. In here, see. Turn Now On.\r\n\r\nHe slid it into the left slot for them. It shot down the groove, wobbled\r\na while, ceased, ogling them: six.\r\n\r\nLawyers of the past, haughty, pleading, beheld pass from the\r\nconsolidated taxing office to Nisi Prius court Richie Goulding carrying\r\nthe costbag of Goulding, Collis and Ward and heard rustling from the\r\nadmiralty division of king\xe2\x80\x99s bench to the court of appeal an elderly\r\nfemale with false teeth smiling incredulously and a black silk skirt of\r\ngreat amplitude.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94See? he said. See now the last one I put in is over here: Turns Over.\r\nThe impact. Leverage, see?\r\n\r\nHe showed them the rising column of disks on the right.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Smart idea, Nosey Flynn said, snuffling. So a fellow coming in late can\r\nsee what turn is on and what turns are over.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94See? Tom Rochford said.\r\n\r\nHe slid in a disk for himself: and watched it shoot, wobble, ogle, stop:\r\nfour. Turn Now On.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ll see him now in the Ormond, Lenehan said, and sound him. One good\r\nturn deserves another.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Do, Tom Rochford said. Tell him I\xe2\x80\x99m Boylan with impatience.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Goodnight, M\xe2\x80\x99Coy said abruptly. When you two begin...\r\n\r\nNosey Flynn stooped towards the lever, snuffling at it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94But how does it work here, Tommy? he asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Tooraloo, Lenehan said. See you later.\r\n\r\nHe followed M\xe2\x80\x99Coy out across the tiny square of Crampton court.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94He\xe2\x80\x99s a hero, he said simply.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I know, M\xe2\x80\x99Coy said. The drain, you mean.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Drain? Lenehan said. It was down a manhole.\r\n\r\nThey passed Dan Lowry\xe2\x80\x99s musichall where Marie Kendall, charming\r\nsoubrette, smiled on them from a poster a dauby smile.\r\n\r\nGoing down the path of Sycamore street beside the Empire musichall\r\nLenehan showed M\xe2\x80\x99Coy how the whole thing was. One of those manholes like\r\na bloody gaspipe and there was the poor devil stuck down in it, half\r\nchoked with sewer gas. Down went Tom Rochford anyhow, booky\xe2\x80\x99s vest and\r\nall, with the rope round him. And be damned but he got the rope round\r\nthe poor devil and the two were hauled up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94The act of a hero, he said.\r\n\r\nAt the Dolphin they halted to allow the ambulance car to gallop past\r\nthem for Jervis street.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94This way, he said, walking to the right. I want to pop into Lynam\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nto see Sceptre\xe2\x80\x99s starting price. What\xe2\x80\x99s the time by your gold watch and\r\nchain?\r\n\r\nM\xe2\x80\x99Coy peered into Marcus Tertius Moses\xe2\x80\x99 sombre office, then at O\xe2\x80\x99Neill\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nclock.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94After three, he said. Who\xe2\x80\x99s riding her?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94O. Madden, Lenehan said. And a game filly she is.\r\n\r\nWhile he waited in Temple bar M\xe2\x80\x99Coy dodged a banana peel with gentle\r\npushes of his toe from the path to the gutter. Fellow might damn easy\r\nget a nasty fall there coming along tight in the dark.\r\n\r\nThe gates of the drive opened wide to give egress to the viceregal\r\ncavalcade.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Even money, Lenehan said returning. I knocked against Bantam Lyons\r\nin there going to back a bloody horse someone gave him that hasn\xe2\x80\x99t an\r\nearthly. Through here.\r\n\r\nThey went up the steps and under Merchants\xe2\x80\x99 arch. A darkbacked figure\r\nscanned books on the hawker\xe2\x80\x99s cart.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94There he is, Lenehan said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Wonder what he\xe2\x80\x99s buying, M\xe2\x80\x99Coy said, glancing behind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Leopoldo or the Bloom is on the Rye, Lenehan said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94He\xe2\x80\x99s dead nuts on sales, M\xe2\x80\x99Coy said. I was with him one day and he\r\nbought a book from an old one in Liffey street for two bob. There were\r\nfine plates in it worth double the money, the stars and the moon and\r\ncomets with long tails. Astronomy it was about.\r\n\r\nLenehan laughed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you a damn good one about comets\xe2\x80\x99 tails, he said. Come over\r\nin the sun.\r\n\r\nThey crossed to the metal bridge and went along Wellington quay by the\r\nriverwall.\r\n\r\nMaster Patrick Aloysius Dignam came out of Mangan\xe2\x80\x99s, late Fehrenbach\xe2\x80\x99s,\r\ncarrying a pound and a half of porksteaks.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94There was a long spread out at Glencree reformatory, Lenehan said\r\neagerly. The annual dinner, you know. Boiled shirt affair. The lord\r\nmayor was there, Val Dillon it was, and sir Charles Cameron and Dan\r\nDawson spoke and there was music. Bartell d\xe2\x80\x99Arcy sang and Benjamin\r\nDollard...\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I know, M\xe2\x80\x99Coy broke in. My missus sang there once.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Did she? Lenehan said.\r\n\r\nA card Unfurnished Apartments reappeared on the windowsash of number 7\r\nEccles street.\r\n\r\nHe checked his tale a moment but broke out in a wheezy laugh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94But wait till I tell you, he said. Delahunt of Camden street had the\r\ncatering and yours truly was chief bottlewasher. Bloom and the wife were\r\nthere. Lashings of stuff we put up: port wine and sherry and curacao to\r\nwhich we did ample justice. Fast and furious it was. After liquids came\r\nsolids. Cold joints galore and mince pies...\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I know, M\xe2\x80\x99Coy said. The year the missus was there...\r\n\r\nLenehan linked his arm warmly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94But wait till I tell you, he said. We had a midnight lunch too after\r\nall the jollification and when we sallied forth it was blue o\xe2\x80\x99clock the\r\nmorning after the night before. Coming home it was a gorgeous winter\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nnight on the Featherbed Mountain. Bloom and Chris Callinan were on one\r\nside of the car and I was with the wife on the other. We started singing\r\nglees and duets: Lo, the early beam of morning. She was well primed\r\nwith a good load of Delahunt\xe2\x80\x99s port under her bellyband. Every jolt the\r\nbloody car gave I had her bumping up against me. Hell\xe2\x80\x99s delights! She\r\nhas a fine pair, God bless her. Like that.\r\n\r\nHe held his caved hands a cubit from him, frowning:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I was tucking the rug under her and settling her boa all the time. Know\r\nwhat I mean?\r\n\r\nHis hands moulded ample curves of air. He shut his eyes tight in\r\ndelight, his body shrinking, and blew a sweet chirp from his lips.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94The lad stood to attention anyhow, he said with a sigh. She\xe2\x80\x99s a gamey\r\nmare and no mistake. Bloom was pointing out all the stars and the comets\r\nin the heavens to Chris Callinan and the jarvey: the great bear and\r\nHercules and the dragon, and the whole jingbang lot. But, by God, I was\r\nlost, so to speak, in the milky way. He knows them all, faith. At last\r\nshe spotted a weeny weeshy one miles away. And what star is that, Poldy?\r\nsays she. By God, she had Bloom cornered. That one, is it? says Chris\r\nCallinan, sure that\xe2\x80\x99s only what you might call a pinprick. By God, he\r\nwasn\xe2\x80\x99t far wide of the mark.\r\n\r\nLenehan stopped and leaned on the riverwall, panting with soft laughter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99m weak, he gasped.\r\n\r\nM\xe2\x80\x99Coy\xe2\x80\x99s white face smiled about it at instants and grew grave. Lenehan\r\nwalked on again. He lifted his yachtingcap and scratched his hindhead\r\nrapidly. He glanced sideways in the sunlight at M\xe2\x80\x99Coy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94He\xe2\x80\x99s a cultured allroundman, Bloom is, he said seriously. He\xe2\x80\x99s not one\r\nof your common or garden... you know... There\xe2\x80\x99s a touch of the artist\r\nabout old Bloom.\r\n\r\nMr Bloom turned over idly pages of The Awful Disclosures of Maria Monk,\r\nthen of Aristotle\xe2\x80\x99s Masterpiece. Crooked botched print. Plates: infants\r\ncuddled in a ball in bloodred wombs like livers of slaughtered cows.\r\nLots of them like that at this moment all over the world. All butting\r\nwith their skulls to get out of it. Child born every minute somewhere.\r\nMrs Purefoy.\r\n\r\nHe laid both books aside and glanced at the third: Tales of the Ghetto\r\nby Leopold von Sacher Masoch.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94That I had, he said, pushing it by.\r\n\r\nThe shopman let two volumes fall on the counter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Them are two good ones, he said.\r\n\r\nOnions of his breath came across the counter out of his ruined mouth.\r\nHe bent to make a bundle of the other books, hugged them against his\r\nunbuttoned waistcoat and bore them off behind the dingy curtain.\r\n\r\nOn O\xe2\x80\x99Connell bridge many persons observed the grave deportment and gay\r\napparel of Mr Denis J Maginni, professor of dancing &c.\r\n\r\nMr Bloom, alone, looked at the titles. Fair Tyrants by James Lovebirch.\r\nKnow the kind that is. Had it? Yes.\r\n\r\nHe opened it. Thought so.\r\n\r\nA woman\xe2\x80\x99s voice behind the dingy curtain. Listen: the man.\r\n\r\nNo: she wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t like that much. Got her it once.\r\n\r\nHe read the other title: Sweets of Sin. More in her line. Let us see.\r\n\r\nHe read where his finger opened.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94All the dollarbills her husband gave her were spent in the stores on\r\nwondrous gowns and costliest frillies. For him! For Raoul!\r\n\r\nYes. This. Here. Try.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Her mouth glued on his in a luscious voluptuous kiss while his hands\r\nfelt for the opulent curves inside her d\xc3\xa9shabill\xc3\xa9.\r\n\r\nYes. Take this. The end.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94You are late, he spoke hoarsely, eying her with a suspicious glare.\r\n\r\nThe beautiful woman threw off her sabletrimmed wrap, displaying her\r\nqueenly shoulders and heaving embonpoint. An imperceptible smile played\r\nround her perfect lips as she turned to him calmly.\r\n\r\nMr Bloom read again: The beautiful woman.\r\n\r\nWarmth showered gently over him, cowing his flesh. Flesh yielded amply\r\namid rumpled clothes: whites of eyes swooning up. His nostrils arched\r\nthemselves for prey. Melting breast ointments (for him! For Raoul!).\r\nArmpits\xe2\x80\x99 oniony sweat. Fishgluey slime (her heaving embonpoint!). Feel!\r\nPress! Crished! Sulphur dung of lions!\r\n\r\nYoung! Young!\r\n\r\nAn elderly female, no more young, left the building of the courts of\r\nchancery, king\xe2\x80\x99s bench, exchequer and common pleas, having heard in\r\nthe lord chancellor\xe2\x80\x99s court the case in lunacy of Potterton, in the\r\nadmiralty division the summons, exparte motion, of the owners of the\r\nLady Cairns versus the owners of the barque Mona, in the court of appeal\r\nreservation of judgment in the case of Harvey versus the Ocean Accident\r\nand Guarantee Corporation.\r\n\r\nPhlegmy coughs shook the air of the bookshop, bulging out the dingy\r\ncurtains. The shopman\xe2\x80\x99s uncombed grey head came out and his unshaven\r\nreddened face, coughing. He raked his throat rudely, puked phlegm on the\r\nfloor. He put his boot on what he had spat, wiping his sole along it,\r\nand bent, showing a rawskinned crown, scantily haired.\r\n\r\nMr Bloom beheld it.\r\n\r\nMastering his troubled breath, he said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ll take this one.\r\n\r\nThe shopman lifted eyes bleared with old rheum.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Sweets of Sin, he said, tapping on it. That\xe2\x80\x99s a good one.\r\n\r\nThe lacquey by the door of Dillon\xe2\x80\x99s auctionrooms shook his handbell\r\ntwice again and viewed himself in the chalked mirror of the cabinet.\r\n\r\nDilly Dedalus, loitering by the curbstone, heard the beats of the\r\nbell, the cries of the auctioneer within. Four and nine. Those lovely\r\ncurtains. Five shillings. Cosy curtains. Selling new at two guineas. Any\r\nadvance on five shillings? Going for five shillings.\r\n\r\nThe lacquey lifted his handbell and shook it:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Barang!\r\n\r\nBang of the lastlap bell spurred the halfmile wheelmen to their sprint.\r\nJ. A. Jackson, W. E. Wylie, A. Munro and H. T. Gahan, their stretched\r\nnecks wagging, negotiated the curve by the College library.\r\n\r\nMr Dedalus, tugging a long moustache, came round from Williams\xe2\x80\x99s row. He\r\nhalted near his daughter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94It\xe2\x80\x99s time for you, she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Stand up straight for the love of the lord Jesus, Mr Dedalus said.\r\nAre you trying to imitate your uncle John, the cornetplayer, head upon\r\nshoulder? Melancholy God!\r\n\r\nDilly shrugged her shoulders. Mr Dedalus placed his hands on them and\r\nheld them back.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Stand up straight, girl, he said. You\xe2\x80\x99ll get curvature of the spine. Do\r\nyou know what you look like?\r\n\r\nHe let his head sink suddenly down and forward, hunching his shoulders\r\nand dropping his underjaw.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Give it up, father, Dilly said. All the people are looking at you.\r\n\r\nMr Dedalus drew himself upright and tugged again at his moustache.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Did you get any money? Dilly asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Where would I get money? Mr Dedalus said. There is no-one in Dublin\r\nwould lend me fourpence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94You got some, Dilly said, looking in his eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94How do you know that? Mr Dedalus asked, his tongue in his cheek.\r\n\r\nMr Kernan, pleased with the order he had booked, walked boldly along\r\nJames\xe2\x80\x99s street.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I know you did, Dilly answered. Were you in the Scotch house now?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I was not, then, Mr Dedalus said, smiling. Was it the little nuns\r\ntaught you to be so saucy? Here.\r\n\r\nHe handed her a shilling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94See if you can do anything with that, he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I suppose you got five, Dilly said. Give me more than that.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Wait awhile, Mr Dedalus said threateningly. You\xe2\x80\x99re like the rest of\r\nthem, are you? An insolent pack of little bitches since your poor mother\r\ndied. But wait awhile. You\xe2\x80\x99ll all get a short shrift and a long day from\r\nme. Low blackguardism! I\xe2\x80\x99m going to get rid of you. Wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t care if I\r\nwas stretched out stiff. He\xe2\x80\x99s dead. The man upstairs is dead.\r\n\r\nHe left her and walked on. Dilly followed quickly and pulled his coat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Well, what is it? he said, stopping.\r\n\r\nThe lacquey rang his bell behind their backs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Barang!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Curse your bloody blatant soul, Mr Dedalus cried, turning on him.\r\n\r\nThe lacquey, aware of comment, shook the lolling clapper of his bell but\r\nfeebly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Bang!\r\n\r\nMr Dedalus stared at him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Watch him, he said. It\xe2\x80\x99s instructive. I wonder will he allow us to\r\ntalk.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94You got more than that, father, Dilly said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99m going to show you a little trick, Mr Dedalus said. I\xe2\x80\x99ll leave\r\nyou all where Jesus left the jews. Look, there\xe2\x80\x99s all I have. I got\r\ntwo shillings from Jack Power and I spent twopence for a shave for the\r\nfuneral.\r\n\r\nHe drew forth a handful of copper coins, nervously.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Can\xe2\x80\x99t you look for some money somewhere? Dilly said.\r\n\r\nMr Dedalus thought and nodded.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I will, he said gravely. I looked all along the gutter in O\xe2\x80\x99Connell\r\nstreet. I\xe2\x80\x99ll try this one now.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94You\xe2\x80\x99re very funny, Dilly said, grinning.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Here, Mr Dedalus said, handing her two pennies. Get a glass of milk for\r\nyourself and a bun or a something. I\xe2\x80\x99ll be home shortly.\r\n\r\nHe put the other coins in his pocket and started to walk on.\r\n\r\nThe viceregal cavalcade passed, greeted by obsequious policemen, out of\r\nParkgate.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99m sure you have another shilling, Dilly said.\r\n\r\nThe lacquey banged loudly.\r\n\r\nMr Dedalus amid the din walked off, murmuring to himself with a pursing\r\nmincing mouth gently:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94The little nuns! Nice little things! O, sure they wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do anything!\r\nO, sure they wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t really! Is it little sister Monica!\r\n\r\nFrom the sundial towards James\xe2\x80\x99s gate walked Mr Kernan, pleased with the\r\norder he had booked for Pulbrook Robertson, boldly along James\xe2\x80\x99s street,\r\npast Shackleton\xe2\x80\x99s offices. Got round him all right. How do you do, Mr\r\nCrimmins? First rate, sir. I was afraid you might be up in your other\r\nestablishment in Pimlico. How are things going? Just keeping alive.\r\nLovely weather we\xe2\x80\x99re having. Yes, indeed. Good for the country. Those\r\nfarmers are always grumbling. I\xe2\x80\x99ll just take a thimbleful of your best\r\ngin, Mr Crimmins. A small gin, sir. Yes, sir. Terrible affair that\r\nGeneral Slocum explosion. Terrible, terrible! A thousand casualties. And\r\nheartrending scenes. Men trampling down women and children. Most brutal\r\nthing. What do they say was the cause? Spontaneous combustion. Most\r\nscandalous revelation. Not a single lifeboat would float and the\r\nfirehose all burst. What I can\xe2\x80\x99t understand is how the inspectors ever\r\nallowed a boat like that... Now, you\xe2\x80\x99re talking straight, Mr Crimmins.\r\nYou know why? Palm oil. Is that a fact? Without a doubt. Well now, look\r\nat that. And America they say is the land of the free. I thought we were\r\nbad here.\r\n\r\nI smiled at him. America, I said quietly, just like that. What is it?\r\nThe sweepings of every country including our own. Isn\xe2\x80\x99t that true?\r\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s a fact.\r\n\r\nGraft, my dear sir. Well, of course, where there\xe2\x80\x99s money going there\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nalways someone to pick it up.\r\n\r\nSaw him looking at my frockcoat. Dress does it. Nothing like a dressy\r\nappearance. Bowls them over.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Hello, Simon, Father Cowley said. How are things?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Hello, Bob, old man, Mr Dedalus answered, stopping.\r\n\r\nMr Kernan halted and preened himself before the sloping mirror of Peter\r\nKennedy, hairdresser. Stylish coat, beyond a doubt. Scott of Dawson\r\nstreet. Well worth the half sovereign I gave Neary for it. Never built\r\nunder three guineas. Fits me down to the ground. Some Kildare street\r\nclub toff had it probably. John Mulligan, the manager of the Hibernian\r\nbank, gave me a very sharp eye yesterday on Carlisle bridge as if he\r\nremembered me.\r\n\r\nAham! Must dress the character for those fellows. Knight of the road.\r\nGentleman. And now, Mr Crimmins, may we have the honour of your custom\r\nagain, sir. The cup that cheers but not inebriates, as the old saying\r\nhas it.\r\n\r\nNorth wall and sir John Rogerson\xe2\x80\x99s quay, with hulls and anchorchains,\r\nsailing westward, sailed by a skiff, a crumpled throwaway, rocked on the\r\nferrywash, Elijah is coming.\r\n\r\nMr Kernan glanced in farewell at his image. High colour, of course.\r\nGrizzled moustache. Returned Indian officer. Bravely he bore his stumpy\r\nbody forward on spatted feet, squaring his shoulders. Is that Ned\r\nLambert\xe2\x80\x99s brother over the way, Sam? What? Yes. He\xe2\x80\x99s as like it as damn\r\nit. No. The windscreen of that motorcar in the sun there. Just a flash\r\nlike that. Damn like him.\r\n\r\nAham! Hot spirit of juniper juice warmed his vitals and his breath. Good\r\ndrop of gin, that was. His frocktails winked in bright sunshine to his\r\nfat strut.\r\n\r\nDown there Emmet was hanged, drawn and quartered. Greasy black rope.\r\nDogs licking the blood off the street when the lord lieutenant\xe2\x80\x99s wife\r\ndrove by in her noddy.\r\n\r\nBad times those were. Well, well. Over and done with. Great topers too.\r\nFourbottle men.\r\n\r\nLet me see. Is he buried in saint Michan\xe2\x80\x99s? Or no, there was a midnight\r\nburial in Glasnevin. Corpse brought in through a secret door in the\r\nwall. Dignam is there now. Went out in a puff. Well, well. Better turn\r\ndown here. Make a detour.\r\n\r\nMr Kernan turned and walked down the slope of Watling street by\r\nthe corner of Guinness\xe2\x80\x99s visitors\xe2\x80\x99 waitingroom. Outside the Dublin\r\nDistillers Company\xe2\x80\x99s stores an outside car without fare or jarvey stood,\r\nthe reins knotted to the wheel. Damn dangerous thing. Some Tipperary\r\nbosthoon endangering the lives of the citizens. Runaway horse.\r\n\r\nDenis Breen with his tomes, weary of having waited an hour in John\r\nHenry Menton\xe2\x80\x99s office, led his wife over O\xe2\x80\x99Connell bridge, bound for the\r\noffice of Messrs Collis and Ward.\r\n\r\nMr Kernan approached Island street.\r\n\r\nTimes of the troubles. Must ask Ned Lambert to lend me those\r\nreminiscences of sir Jonah Barrington. When you look back on it all\r\nnow in a kind of retrospective arrangement. Gaming at Daly\xe2\x80\x99s. No\r\ncardsharping then. One of those fellows got his hand nailed to the table\r\nby a dagger. Somewhere here lord Edward Fitzgerald escaped from major\r\nSirr. Stables behind Moira house.\r\n\r\nDamn good gin that was.\r\n\r\nFine dashing young nobleman. Good stock, of course. That ruffian, that\r\nsham squire, with his violet gloves gave him away. Course they were\r\non the wrong side. They rose in dark and evil days. Fine poem that\r\nis: Ingram. They were gentlemen. Ben Dollard does sing that ballad\r\ntouchingly. Masterly rendition.\r\n\r\nAt the siege of Ross did my father fall.\r\n\r\nA cavalcade in easy trot along Pembroke quay passed, outriders leaping,\r\nleaping in their, in their saddles. Frockcoats. Cream sunshades.\r\n\r\nMr Kernan hurried forward, blowing pursily.\r\n\r\nHis Excellency! Too bad! Just missed that by a hair. Damn it! What a\r\npity!\r\n\r\nStephen Dedalus watched through the webbed window the lapidary\xe2\x80\x99s fingers\r\nprove a timedulled chain. Dust webbed the window and the showtrays. Dust\r\ndarkened the toiling fingers with their vulture nails. Dust slept\r\non dull coils of bronze and silver, lozenges of cinnabar, on rubies,\r\nleprous and winedark stones.\r\n\r\nBorn all in the dark wormy earth, cold specks of fire, evil, lights\r\nshining in the darkness. Where fallen archangels flung the stars of\r\ntheir brows. Muddy swinesnouts, hands, root and root, gripe and wrest\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nShe dances in a foul gloom where gum bums with garlic. A sailorman,\r\nrustbearded, sips from a beaker rum and eyes her. A long and seafed\r\nsilent rut. She dances, capers, wagging her sowish haunches and her\r\nhips, on her gross belly flapping a ruby egg.\r\n\r\nOld Russell with a smeared shammy rag burnished again his gem, turned it\r\nand held it at the point of his Moses\xe2\x80\x99 beard. Grandfather ape gloating\r\non a stolen hoard.\r\n\r\nAnd you who wrest old images from the burial earth? The brainsick words\r\nof sophists: Antisthenes. A lore of drugs. Orient and immortal wheat\r\nstanding from everlasting to everlasting.\r\n\r\nTwo old women fresh from their whiff of the briny trudged through\r\nIrishtown along London bridge road, one with a sanded tired umbrella,\r\none with a midwife\xe2\x80\x99s bag in which eleven cockles rolled.\r\n\r\nThe whirr of flapping leathern bands and hum of dynamos from the\r\npowerhouse urged Stephen to be on. Beingless beings. Stop! Throb always\r\nwithout you and the throb always within. Your heart you sing of. I\r\nbetween them. Where? Between two roaring worlds where they swirl, I.\r\nShatter them, one and both. But stun myself too in the blow. Shatter me\r\nyou who can. Bawd and butcher were the words. I say! Not yet awhile. A\r\nlook around.\r\n\r\nYes, quite true. Very large and wonderful and keeps famous time. You say\r\nright, sir. A Monday morning, \xe2\x80\x98twas so, indeed.\r\n\r\nStephen went down Bedford row, the handle of the ash clacking against\r\nhis shoulderblade. In Clohissey\xe2\x80\x99s window a faded 1860 print of Heenan\r\nboxing Sayers held his eye. Staring backers with square hats stood\r\nround the roped prizering. The heavyweights in tight loincloths proposed\r\ngently each to other his bulbous fists. And they are throbbing: heroes\xe2\x80\x99\r\nhearts.\r\n\r\nHe turned and halted by the slanted bookcart.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Twopence each, the huckster said. Four for sixpence.\r\n\r\nTattered pages. The Irish Beekeeper. Life and Miracles of the Cur\xc3\xa9 of\r\nArs. Pocket Guide to Killarney.\r\n\r\nI might find here one of my pawned schoolprizes. Stephano Dedalo, alumno\r\noptimo, palmam ferenti.\r\n\r\nFather Conmee, having read his little hours, walked through the hamlet\r\nof Donnycarney, murmuring vespers.\r\n\r\nBinding too good probably. What is this? Eighth and ninth book of Moses.\r\nSecret of all secrets. Seal of King David. Thumbed pages: read and read.\r\nWho has passed here before me? How to soften chapped hands. Recipe for\r\nwhite wine vinegar. How to win a woman\xe2\x80\x99s love. For me this. Say the\r\nfollowing talisman three times with hands folded:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Se el yilo nebrakada femininum! Amor me solo! Sanktus! Amen.\r\n\r\nWho wrote this? Charms and invocations of the most blessed abbot Peter\r\nSalanka to all true believers divulged. As good as any other abbot\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncharms, as mumbling Joachim\xe2\x80\x99s. Down, baldynoddle, or we\xe2\x80\x99ll wool your\r\nwool.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94What are you doing here, Stephen?\r\n\r\nDilly\xe2\x80\x99s high shoulders and shabby dress.\r\n\r\nShut the book quick. Don\xe2\x80\x99t let see.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94What are you doing? Stephen said.\r\n\r\nA Stuart face of nonesuch Charles, lank locks falling at its sides. It\r\nglowed as she crouched feeding the fire with broken boots. I told her\r\nof Paris. Late lieabed under a quilt of old overcoats, fingering a\r\npinchbeck bracelet, Dan Kelly\xe2\x80\x99s token. Nebrakada femininum.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94What have you there? Stephen asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I bought it from the other cart for a penny, Dilly said, laughing\r\nnervously. Is it any good?\r\n\r\nMy eyes they say she has. Do others see me so? Quick, far and daring.\r\nShadow of my mind.\r\n\r\nHe took the coverless book from her hand. Chardenal\xe2\x80\x99s French primer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94What did you buy that for? he asked. To learn French?\r\n\r\nShe nodded, reddening and closing tight her lips.\r\n\r\nShow no surprise. Quite natural.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Here, Stephen said. It\xe2\x80\x99s all right. Mind Maggy doesn\xe2\x80\x99t pawn it on you.\r\nI suppose all my books are gone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Some, Dilly said. We had to.\r\n\r\nShe is drowning. Agenbite. Save her. Agenbite. All against us. She will\r\ndrown me with her, eyes and hair. Lank coils of seaweed hair around me,\r\nmy heart, my soul. Salt green death.\r\n\r\nWe.\r\n\r\nAgenbite of inwit. Inwit\xe2\x80\x99s agenbite.\r\n\r\nMisery! Misery!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Hello, Simon, Father Cowley said. How are things?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Hello, Bob, old man, Mr Dedalus answered, stopping.\r\n\r\nThey clasped hands loudly outside Reddy and Daughter\xe2\x80\x99s. Father Cowley\r\nbrushed his moustache often downward with a scooping hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94What\xe2\x80\x99s the best news? Mr Dedalus said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Why then not much, Father Cowley said. I\xe2\x80\x99m barricaded up, Simon, with\r\ntwo men prowling around the house trying to effect an entrance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Jolly, Mr Dedalus said. Who is it?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94O, Father Cowley said. A certain gombeen man of our acquaintance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94With a broken back, is it? Mr Dedalus asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94The same, Simon, Father Cowley answered. Reuben of that ilk. I\xe2\x80\x99m just\r\nwaiting for Ben Dollard. He\xe2\x80\x99s going to say a word to long John to get\r\nhim to take those two men off. All I want is a little time.\r\n\r\nHe looked with vague hope up and down the quay, a big apple bulging in\r\nhis neck.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I know, Mr Dedalus said, nodding. Poor old bockedy Ben! He\xe2\x80\x99s always\r\ndoing a good turn for someone. Hold hard!\r\n\r\nHe put on his glasses and gazed towards the metal bridge an instant.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94There he is, by God, he said, arse and pockets.\r\n\r\nBen Dollard\xe2\x80\x99s loose blue cutaway and square hat above large slops\r\ncrossed the quay in full gait from the metal bridge. He came towards\r\nthem at an amble, scratching actively behind his coattails.\r\n\r\nAs he came near Mr Dedalus greeted:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Hold that fellow with the bad trousers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Hold him now, Ben Dollard said.\r\n\r\nMr Dedalus eyed with cold wandering scorn various points of Ben\r\nDollard\xe2\x80\x99s figure. Then, turning to Father Cowley with a nod, he muttered\r\nsneeringly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94That\xe2\x80\x99s a pretty garment, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it, for a summer\xe2\x80\x99s day?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Why, God eternally curse your soul, Ben Dollard growled furiously, I\r\nthrew out more clothes in my time than you ever saw.\r\n\r\nHe stood beside them beaming, on them first and on his roomy clothes\r\nfrom points of which Mr Dedalus flicked fluff, saying:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94They were made for a man in his health, Ben, anyhow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Bad luck to the jewman that made them, Ben Dollard said. Thanks be to\r\nGod he\xe2\x80\x99s not paid yet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94And how is that basso profondo, Benjamin? Father Cowley asked.\r\n\r\nCashel Boyle O\xe2\x80\x99Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell, murmuring,\r\nglassyeyed, strode past the Kildare street club.\r\n\r\nBen Dollard frowned and, making suddenly a chanter\xe2\x80\x99s mouth, gave forth a\r\ndeep note.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Aw! he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94That\xe2\x80\x99s the style, Mr Dedalus said, nodding to its drone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94What about that? Ben Dollard said. Not too dusty? What?\r\n\r\nHe turned to both.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94That\xe2\x80\x99ll do, Father Cowley said, nodding also.\r\n\r\nThe reverend Hugh C. Love walked from the old chapterhouse of saint\r\nMary\xe2\x80\x99s abbey past James and Charles Kennedy\xe2\x80\x99s, rectifiers, attended by\r\nGeraldines tall and personable, towards the Tholsel beyond the ford of\r\nhurdles.\r\n\r\nBen Dollard with a heavy list towards the shopfronts led them forward,\r\nhis joyful fingers in the air.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Come along with me to the subsheriff\xe2\x80\x99s office, he said. I want to\r\nshow you the new beauty Rock has for a bailiff. He\xe2\x80\x99s a cross between\r\nLobengula and Lynchehaun. He\xe2\x80\x99s well worth seeing, mind you. Come along.\r\nI saw John Henry Menton casually in the Bodega just now and it will\r\ncost me a fall if I don\xe2\x80\x99t... Wait awhile... We\xe2\x80\x99re on the right lay, Bob,\r\nbelieve you me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94For a few days tell him, Father Cowley said anxiously.\r\n\r\nBen Dollard halted and stared, his loud orifice open, a dangling button\r\nof his coat wagging brightbacked from its thread as he wiped away the\r\nheavy shraums that clogged his eyes to hear aright.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94What few days? he boomed. Hasn\xe2\x80\x99t your landlord distrained for rent?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94He has, Father Cowley said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Then our friend\xe2\x80\x99s writ is not worth the paper it\xe2\x80\x99s printed on, Ben\r\nDollard said. The landlord has the prior claim. I gave him all the\r\nparticulars. 29 Windsor avenue. Love is the name?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94That\xe2\x80\x99s right, Father Cowley said. The reverend Mr Love. He\xe2\x80\x99s a minister\r\nin the country somewhere. But are you sure of that?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94You can tell Barabbas from me, Ben Dollard said, that he can put that\r\nwrit where Jacko put the nuts.\r\n\r\nHe led Father Cowley boldly forward, linked to his bulk.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Filberts I believe they were, Mr Dedalus said, as he dropped his\r\nglasses on his coatfront, following them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94The youngster will be all right, Martin Cunningham said, as they passed\r\nout of the Castleyard gate.\r\n\r\nThe policeman touched his forehead.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94God bless you, Martin Cunningham said, cheerily.\r\n\r\nHe signed to the waiting jarvey who chucked at the reins and set on\r\ntowards Lord Edward street.\r\n\r\nBronze by gold, Miss Kennedy\xe2\x80\x99s head by Miss Douce\xe2\x80\x99s head, appeared above\r\nthe crossblind of the Ormond hotel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Yes, Martin Cunningham said, fingering his beard. I wrote to Father\r\nConmee and laid the whole case before him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94You could try our friend, Mr Power suggested backward.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Boyd? Martin Cunningham said shortly. Touch me not.\r\n\r\nJohn Wyse Nolan, lagging behind, reading the list, came after them\r\nquickly down Cork hill.\r\n\r\nOn the steps of the City hall Councillor Nannetti, descending, hailed\r\nAlderman Cowley and Councillor Abraham Lyon ascending.\r\n\r\nThe castle car wheeled empty into upper Exchange street.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Look here, Martin, John Wyse Nolan said, overtaking them at the Mail\r\noffice. I see Bloom put his name down for five shillings.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Quite right, Martin Cunningham said, taking the list. And put down the\r\nfive shillings too.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Without a second word either, Mr Power said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Strange but true, Martin Cunningham added.\r\n\r\nJohn Wyse Nolan opened wide eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ll say there is much kindness in the jew, he quoted, elegantly.\r\n\r\nThey went down Parliament street.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94There\xe2\x80\x99s Jimmy Henry, Mr Power said, just heading for Kavanagh\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Righto, Martin Cunningham said. Here goes.\r\n\r\nOutside la Maison Claire Blazes Boylan waylaid Jack Mooney\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbrother-in-law, humpy, tight, making for the liberties.\r\n\r\nJohn Wyse Nolan fell back with Mr Power, while Martin Cunningham took\r\nthe elbow of a dapper little man in a shower of hail suit, who walked\r\nuncertainly, with hasty steps past Micky Anderson\xe2\x80\x99s watches.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94The assistant town clerk\xe2\x80\x99s corns are giving him some trouble, John Wyse\r\nNolan told Mr Power.\r\n\r\nThey followed round the corner towards James Kavanagh\xe2\x80\x99s winerooms. The\r\nempty castle car fronted them at rest in Essex gate. Martin Cunningham,\r\nspeaking always, showed often the list at which Jimmy Henry did not\r\nglance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94And long John Fanning is here too, John Wyse Nolan said, as large as\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nThe tall form of long John Fanning filled the doorway where he stood.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Good day, Mr Subsheriff, Martin Cunningham said, as all halted and\r\ngreeted.\r\n\r\nLong John Fanning made no way for them. He removed his large Henry Clay\r\ndecisively and his large fierce eyes scowled intelligently over all\r\ntheir faces.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Are the conscript fathers pursuing their peaceful deliberations? he\r\nsaid with rich acrid utterance to the assistant town clerk.\r\n\r\nHell open to christians they were having, Jimmy Henry said pettishly,\r\nabout their damned Irish language. Where was the marshal, he wanted\r\nto know, to keep order in the council chamber. And old Barlow the\r\nmacebearer laid up with asthma, no mace on the table, nothing in order,\r\nno quorum even, and Hutchinson, the lord mayor, in Llandudno and little\r\nLorcan Sherlock doing locum tenens for him. Damned Irish language,\r\nlanguage of our forefathers.\r\n\r\nLong John Fanning blew a plume of smoke from his lips.\r\n\r\nMartin Cunningham spoke by turns, twirling the peak of his beard, to the\r\nassistant town clerk and the subsheriff, while John Wyse Nolan held his\r\npeace.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94What Dignam was that? long John Fanning asked.\r\n\r\nJimmy Henry made a grimace and lifted his left foot.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94O, my corns! he said plaintively. Come upstairs for goodness\xe2\x80\x99 sake till\r\nI sit down somewhere. Uff! Ooo! Mind!\r\n\r\nTestily he made room for himself beside long John Fanning\xe2\x80\x99s flank and\r\npassed in and up the stairs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Come on up, Martin Cunningham said to the subsheriff. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think you\r\nknew him or perhaps you did, though.\r\n\r\nWith John Wyse Nolan Mr Power followed them in.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Decent little soul he was, Mr Power said to the stalwart back of long\r\nJohn Fanning ascending towards long John Fanning in the mirror.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Rather lowsized. Dignam of Menton\xe2\x80\x99s office that was, Martin Cunningham\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\nLong John Fanning could not remember him.\r\n\r\nClatter of horsehoofs sounded from the air.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94What\xe2\x80\x99s that? Martin Cunningham said.\r\n\r\nAll turned where they stood. John Wyse Nolan came down again. From the\r\ncool shadow of the doorway he saw the horses pass Parliament street,\r\nharness and glossy pasterns in sunlight shimmering. Gaily they went past\r\nbefore his cool unfriendly eyes, not quickly. In saddles of the leaders,\r\nleaping leaders, rode outriders.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94What was it? Martin Cunningham asked, as they went on up the staircase.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94The lord lieutenantgeneral and general governor of Ireland, John Wyse\r\nNolan answered from the stairfoot.\r\n\r\nAs they trod across the thick carpet Buck Mulligan whispered behind his\r\nPanama to Haines:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Parnell\xe2\x80\x99s brother. There in the corner.\r\n\r\nThey chose a small table near the window, opposite a longfaced man whose\r\nbeard and gaze hung intently down on a chessboard.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Is that he? Haines asked, twisting round in his seat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Yes, Mulligan said. That\xe2\x80\x99s John Howard, his brother, our city marshal.\r\n\r\nJohn Howard Parnell translated a white bishop quietly and his grey claw\r\nwent up again to his forehead whereat it rested. An instant after, under\r\nits screen, his eyes looked quickly, ghostbright, at his foe and fell\r\nonce more upon a working corner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ll take a m\xc3\xa9lange, Haines said to the waitress.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Two m\xc3\xa9langes, Buck Mulligan said. And bring us some scones and butter\r\nand some cakes as well.\r\n\r\nWhen she had gone he said, laughing:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94We call it D.B.C. because they have damn bad cakes. O, but you missed\r\nDedalus on Hamlet.\r\n\r\nHaines opened his newbought book.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, he said. Shakespeare is the happy huntingground of all minds\r\nthat have lost their balance.\r\n\r\nThe onelegged sailor growled at the area of 14 Nelson street:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94England expects...\r\n\r\nBuck Mulligan\xe2\x80\x99s primrose waistcoat shook gaily to his laughter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94You should see him, he said, when his body loses its balance. Wandering\r\n\xc3\x86ngus I call him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I am sure he has an id\xc3\xa9e fixe, Haines said, pinching his chin\r\nthoughtfully with thumb and forefinger. Now I am speculating what it\r\nwould be likely to be. Such persons always have.\r\n\r\nBuck Mulligan bent across the table gravely.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94They drove his wits astray, he said, by visions of hell. He will never\r\ncapture the Attic note. The note of Swinburne, of all poets, the white\r\ndeath and the ruddy birth. That is his tragedy. He can never be a poet.\r\nThe joy of creation...\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Eternal punishment, Haines said, nodding curtly. I see. I tackled him\r\nthis morning on belief. There was something on his mind, I saw.\r\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s rather interesting because professor Pokorny of Vienna makes an\r\ninteresting point out of that.\r\n\r\nBuck Mulligan\xe2\x80\x99s watchful eyes saw the waitress come. He helped her to\r\nunload her tray.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94He can find no trace of hell in ancient Irish myth, Haines said, amid\r\nthe cheerful cups. The moral idea seems lacking, the sense of destiny,\r\nof retribution. Rather strange he should have just that fixed idea. Does\r\nhe write anything for your movement?\r\n\r\nHe sank two lumps of sugar deftly longwise through the whipped cream.\r\nBuck Mulligan slit a steaming scone in two and plastered butter over its\r\nsmoking pith. He bit off a soft piece hungrily.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Ten years, he said, chewing and laughing. He is going to write\r\nsomething in ten years.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Seems a long way off, Haines said, thoughtfully lifting his spoon.\r\nStill, I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t wonder if he did after all.\r\n\r\nHe tasted a spoonful from the creamy cone of his cup.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94This is real Irish cream I take it, he said with forbearance. I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nwant to be imposed on.\r\n\r\nElijah, skiff, light crumpled throwaway, sailed eastward by flanks of\r\nships and trawlers, amid an archipelago of corks, beyond new Wapping\r\nstreet past Benson\xe2\x80\x99s ferry, and by the threemasted schooner Rosevean\r\nfrom Bridgwater with bricks.\r\n\r\nAlmidano Artifoni walked past Holles street, past Sewell\xe2\x80\x99s yard.\r\nBehind him Cashel Boyle O\xe2\x80\x99Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell, with\r\nstickumbrelladustcoat dangling, shunned the lamp before Mr Law Smith\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhouse and, crossing, walked along Merrion square. Distantly behind him a\r\nblind stripling tapped his way by the wall of College park.\r\n\r\nCashel Boyle O\xe2\x80\x99Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell walked as far as\r\nMr Lewis Werner\xe2\x80\x99s cheerful windows, then turned and strode back along\r\nMerrion square, his stickumbrelladustcoat dangling.\r\n\r\nAt the corner of Wilde\xe2\x80\x99s house he halted, frowned at Elijah\xe2\x80\x99s name\r\nannounced on the Metropolitan hall, frowned at the distant pleasance of\r\nduke\xe2\x80\x99s lawn. His eyeglass flashed frowning in the sun. With ratsteeth\r\nbared he muttered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Coactus volui.\r\n\r\nHe strode on for Clare street, grinding his fierce word.\r\n\r\nAs he strode past Mr Bloom\xe2\x80\x99s dental windows the sway of his dustcoat\r\nbrushed rudely from its angle a slender tapping cane and swept onwards,\r\nhaving buffeted a thewless body. The blind stripling turned his sickly\r\nface after the striding form.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94God\xe2\x80\x99s curse on you, he said sourly, whoever you are! You\xe2\x80\x99re blinder nor\r\nI am, you bitch\xe2\x80\x99s bastard!\r\n\r\nOpposite Ruggy O\xe2\x80\x99Donohoe\xe2\x80\x99s Master Patrick Aloysius Dignam, pawing the\r\npound and a half of Mangan\xe2\x80\x99s, late Fehrenbach\xe2\x80\x99s, porksteaks he had been\r\nsent for, went along warm Wicklow street dawdling. It was too blooming\r\ndull sitting in the parlour with Mrs Stoer and Mrs Quigley and Mrs\r\nMacDowell and the blind down and they all at their sniffles and sipping\r\nsups of the superior tawny sherry uncle Barney brought from Tunney\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\nAnd they eating crumbs of the cottage fruitcake, jawing the whole\r\nblooming time and sighing.\r\n\r\nAfter Wicklow lane the window of Madame Doyle, courtdress milliner,\r\nstopped him. He stood looking in at the two puckers stripped to their\r\npelts and putting up their props. From the sidemirrors two mourning\r\nMasters Dignam gaped silently. Myler Keogh, Dublin\xe2\x80\x99s pet lamb, will\r\nmeet sergeantmajor Bennett, the Portobello bruiser, for a purse of fifty\r\nsovereigns. Gob, that\xe2\x80\x99d be a good pucking match to see. Myler Keogh,\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s the chap sparring out to him with the green sash. Two bar\r\nentrance, soldiers half price. I could easy do a bunk on ma. Master\r\nDignam on his left turned as he turned. That\xe2\x80\x99s me in mourning. When\r\nis it? May the twentysecond. Sure, the blooming thing is all over. He\r\nturned to the right and on his right Master Dignam turned, his cap awry,\r\nhis collar sticking up. Buttoning it down, his chin lifted, he saw the\r\nimage of Marie Kendall, charming soubrette, beside the two puckers. One\r\nof them mots that do be in the packets of fags Stoer smokes that his old\r\nfellow welted hell out of him for one time he found out.\r\n\r\nMaster Dignam got his collar down and dawdled on. The best pucker going\r\nfor strength was Fitzsimons. One puck in the wind from that fellow would\r\nknock you into the middle of next week, man. But the best pucker for\r\nscience was Jem Corbet before Fitzsimons knocked the stuffings out of\r\nhim, dodging and all.\r\n\r\nIn Grafton street Master Dignam saw a red flower in a toff\xe2\x80\x99s mouth and\r\na swell pair of kicks on him and he listening to what the drunk was\r\ntelling him and grinning all the time.\r\n\r\nNo Sandymount tram.\r\n\r\nMaster Dignam walked along Nassau street, shifted the porksteaks to\r\nhis other hand. His collar sprang up again and he tugged it down. The\r\nblooming stud was too small for the buttonhole of the shirt, blooming\r\nend to it. He met schoolboys with satchels. I\xe2\x80\x99m not going tomorrow\r\neither, stay away till Monday. He met other schoolboys. Do they notice\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m in mourning? Uncle Barney said he\xe2\x80\x99d get it into the paper tonight.\r\nThen they\xe2\x80\x99ll all see it in the paper and read my name printed and pa\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nname.\r\n\r\nHis face got all grey instead of being red like it was and there was a\r\nfly walking over it up to his eye. The scrunch that was when they\r\nwere screwing the screws into the coffin: and the bumps when they were\r\nbringing it downstairs.\r\n\r\nPa was inside it and ma crying in the parlour and uncle Barney telling\r\nthe men how to get it round the bend. A big coffin it was, and high and\r\nheavylooking. How was that? The last night pa was boosed he was standing\r\non the landing there bawling out for his boots to go out to Tunney\xe2\x80\x99s for\r\nto boose more and he looked butty and short in his shirt. Never see him\r\nagain. Death, that is. Pa is dead. My father is dead. He told me to be\r\na good son to ma. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t hear the other things he said but I saw\r\nhis tongue and his teeth trying to say it better. Poor pa. That was\r\nMr Dignam, my father. I hope he\xe2\x80\x99s in purgatory now because he went to\r\nconfession to Father Conroy on Saturday night.\r\n\r\nWilliam Humble, earl of Dudley, and lady Dudley, accompanied by\r\nlieutenantcolonel Heseltine, drove out after luncheon from the viceregal\r\nlodge. In the following carriage were the honourable Mrs Paget, Miss de\r\nCourcy and the honourable Gerald Ward A.D.C. in attendance.\r\n\r\nThe cavalcade passed out by the lower gate of Phoenix park saluted by\r\nobsequious policemen and proceeded past Kingsbridge along the northern\r\nquays. The viceroy was most cordially greeted on his way through the\r\nmetropolis. At Bloody bridge Mr Thomas Kernan beyond the river greeted\r\nhim vainly from afar. Between Queen\xe2\x80\x99s and Whitworth bridges lord\r\nDudley\xe2\x80\x99s viceregal carriages passed and were unsaluted by Mr Dudley\r\nWhite, B. L., M. A., who stood on Arran quay outside Mrs M. E. White\xe2\x80\x99s,\r\nthe pawnbroker\xe2\x80\x99s, at the corner of Arran street west stroking his nose\r\nwith his forefinger, undecided whether he should arrive at Phibsborough\r\nmore quickly by a triple change of tram or by hailing a car or on foot\r\nthrough Smithfield, Constitution hill and Broadstone terminus. In the\r\nporch of Four Courts Richie Goulding with the costbag of Goulding,\r\nCollis and Ward saw him with surprise. Past Richmond bridge at the\r\ndoorstep of the office of Reuben J Dodd, solicitor, agent for the\r\nPatriotic Insurance Company, an elderly female about to enter changed\r\nher plan and retracing her steps by King\xe2\x80\x99s windows smiled credulously\r\non the representative of His Majesty. From its sluice in Wood quay wall\r\nunder Tom Devan\xe2\x80\x99s office Poddle river hung out in fealty a tongue of\r\nliquid sewage. Above the crossblind of the Ormond hotel, gold by bronze,\r\nMiss Kennedy\xe2\x80\x99s head by Miss Douce\xe2\x80\x99s head watched and admired. On Ormond\r\nquay Mr Simon Dedalus, steering his way from the greenhouse for the\r\nsubsheriff\xe2\x80\x99s office, stood still in midstreet and brought his hat low.\r\nHis Excellency graciously returned Mr Dedalus\xe2\x80\x99 greeting. From Cahill\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncorner the reverend Hugh C. Love, M.A., made obeisance unperceived,\r\nmindful of lords deputies whose hands benignant had held of yore rich\r\nadvowsons. On Grattan bridge Lenehan and M\xe2\x80\x99Coy, taking leave of each\r\nother, watched the carriages go by. Passing by Roger Greene\xe2\x80\x99s office and\r\nDollard\xe2\x80\x99s big red printinghouse Gerty MacDowell, carrying the Catesby\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncork lino letters for her father who was laid up, knew by the style\r\nit was the lord and lady lieutenant but she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t see what Her\r\nExcellency had on because the tram and Spring\xe2\x80\x99s big yellow furniture van\r\nhad to stop in front of her on account of its being the lord lieutenant.\r\nBeyond Lundy Foot\xe2\x80\x99s from the shaded door of Kavanagh\xe2\x80\x99s winerooms\r\nJohn Wyse Nolan smiled with unseen coldness towards the lord\r\nlieutenantgeneral and general governor of Ireland. The Right Honourable\r\nWilliam Humble, earl of Dudley, G. C. V. O., passed Micky Anderson\xe2\x80\x99s all\r\ntimes ticking watches and Henry and James\xe2\x80\x99s wax smartsuited freshcheeked\r\nmodels, the gentleman Henry, dernier cri James. Over against Dame gate\r\nTom Rochford and Nosey Flynn watched the approach of the cavalcade. Tom\r\nRochford, seeing the eyes of lady Dudley fixed on him, took his thumbs\r\nquickly out of the pockets of his claret waistcoat and doffed his cap\r\nto her. A charming soubrette, great Marie Kendall, with dauby cheeks and\r\nlifted skirt smiled daubily from her poster upon William Humble, earl\r\nof Dudley, and upon lieutenantcolonel H. G. Heseltine, and also upon\r\nthe honourable Gerald Ward A. D. C. From the window of the D. B. C. Buck\r\nMulligan gaily, and Haines gravely, gazed down on the viceregal equipage\r\nover the shoulders of eager guests, whose mass of forms darkened the\r\nchessboard whereon John Howard Parnell looked intently. In Fownes\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nstreet Dilly Dedalus, straining her sight upward from Chardenal\xe2\x80\x99s first\r\nFrench primer, saw sunshades spanned and wheelspokes spinning in the\r\nglare. John Henry Menton, filling the doorway of Commercial Buildings,\r\nstared from winebig oyster eyes, holding a fat gold hunter watch not\r\nlooked at in his fat left hand not feeling it. Where the foreleg of King\r\nBilly\xe2\x80\x99s horse pawed the air Mrs Breen plucked her hastening husband\r\nback from under the hoofs of the outriders. She shouted in his ear the\r\ntidings. Understanding, he shifted his tomes to his left breast\r\nand saluted the second carriage. The honourable Gerald Ward A.D.C.,\r\nagreeably surprised, made haste to reply. At Ponsonby\xe2\x80\x99s corner a jaded\r\nwhite flagon H. halted and four tallhatted white flagons halted behind\r\nhim, E.L.Y.\xe2\x80\x98S, while outriders pranced past and carriages. Opposite\r\nPigott\xe2\x80\x99s music warerooms Mr Denis J Maginni, professor of dancing &c,\r\ngaily apparelled, gravely walked, outpassed by a viceroy and unobserved.\r\nBy the provost\xe2\x80\x99s wall came jauntily Blazes Boylan, stepping in tan shoes\r\nand socks with skyblue clocks to the refrain of My girl\xe2\x80\x99s a Yorkshire\r\ngirl.\r\n\r\nBlazes Boylan presented to the leaders\xe2\x80\x99 skyblue frontlets and high\r\naction a skyblue tie, a widebrimmed straw hat at a rakish angle and a\r\nsuit of indigo serge. His hands in his jacket pockets forgot to salute\r\nbut he offered to the three ladies the bold admiration of his eyes and\r\nthe red flower between his lips. As they drove along Nassau street His\r\nExcellency drew the attention of his bowing consort to the programme of\r\nmusic which was being discoursed in College park. Unseen brazen highland\r\nladdies blared and drumthumped after the cort\xc3\xa8ge:\r\n\r\n     But though she\xe2\x80\x99s a factory lass\r\n     And wears no fancy clothes.\r\n     Baraabum.\r\n     Yet I\xe2\x80\x99ve a sort of a\r\n     Yorkshire relish for\r\n     My little Yorkshire rose.\r\n     Baraabum.\r\n\r\nThither of the wall the quartermile flat handicappers, M. C. Green, H.\r\nShrift, T. M. Patey, C. Scaife, J. B. Jeffs, G. N. Morphy, F. Stevenson,\r\nC. Adderly and W. C. Huggard, started in pursuit. Striding past Finn\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhotel Cashel Boyle O\xe2\x80\x99Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell stared through a\r\nfierce eyeglass across the carriages at the head of Mr M. E. Solomons\r\nin the window of the Austro-Hungarian viceconsulate. Deep in Leinster\r\nstreet by Trinity\xe2\x80\x99s postern a loyal king\xe2\x80\x99s man, Hornblower, touched\r\nhis tallyho cap. As the glossy horses pranced by Merrion square Master\r\nPatrick Aloysius Dignam, waiting, saw salutes being given to the gent\r\nwith the topper and raised also his new black cap with fingers greased\r\nby porksteak paper. His collar too sprang up. The viceroy, on his way to\r\ninaugurate the Mirus bazaar in aid of funds for Mercer\xe2\x80\x99s hospital,\r\ndrove with his following towards Lower Mount street. He passed a blind\r\nstripling opposite Broadbent\xe2\x80\x99s. In Lower Mount street a pedestrian in a\r\nbrown macintosh, eating dry bread, passed swiftly and unscathed across\r\nthe viceroy\xe2\x80\x99s path. At the Royal Canal bridge, from his hoarding,\r\nMr Eugene Stratton, his blub lips agrin, bade all comers welcome to\r\nPembroke township. At Haddington road corner two sanded women halted\r\nthemselves, an umbrella and a bag in which eleven cockles rolled to view\r\nwith wonder the lord mayor and lady mayoress without his golden chain.\r\nOn Northumberland and Lansdowne roads His Excellency acknowledged\r\npunctually salutes from rare male walkers, the salute of two small\r\nschoolboys at the garden gate of the house said to have been admired\r\nby the late queen when visiting the Irish capital with her husband, the\r\nprince consort, in 1849 and the salute of Almidano Artifoni\xe2\x80\x99s sturdy\r\ntrousers swallowed by a closing door.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[ 11 ]\r\n\r\nBronze by gold heard the hoofirons, steelyringing.\r\n\r\nImperthnthn thnthnthn.\r\n\r\nChips, picking chips off rocky thumbnail, chips.\r\n\r\nHorrid!

Where? gold asked more eagerly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94In the second carriage, miss Douce\xe2\x80\x99s wet lips said, laughing in the\r\nsun.\r\n\r\nHe\xe2\x80\x99s looking. Mind till I see.\r\n\r\nShe darted, bronze, to the backmost corner, flattening her face against\r\nthe pane in a halo of hurried breath.\r\n\r\nHer wet lips tittered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94He\xe2\x80\x99s killed looking back.\r\n\r\nShe laughed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94O wept! Aren\xe2\x80\x99t men frightful idiots?\r\n\r\nWith sadness.\r\n\r\nMiss Kennedy sauntered sadly from bright light, twining a loose hair\r\nbehind an ear. Sauntering sadly, gold no more, she twisted twined a\r\nhair. Sadly she twined in sauntering gold hair behind a curving ear.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94It\xe2\x80\x99s them has the fine times, sadly then she said.\r\n\r\nA man.\r\n\r\nBloowho went by by Moulang\xe2\x80\x99s pipes bearing in his breast the sweets\r\nof sin, by Wine\xe2\x80\x99s antiques, in memory bearing sweet sinful words, by\r\nCarroll\xe2\x80\x99s dusky battered plate, for Raoul.\r\n\r\nThe boots to them, them in the bar, them barmaids came. For them\r\nunheeding him he banged on the counter his tray of chattering china. And\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94There\xe2\x80\x99s your teas, he said.\r\n\r\nMiss Kennedy with manners transposed the teatray down to an upturned\r\nlithia crate, safe from eyes, low.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94What is it? loud boots unmannerly asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Find out, miss Douce retorted, leaving her spyingpoint.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Your beau, is it?\r\n\r\nA haughty bronze replied:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ll complain to Mrs de Massey on you if I hear any more of your\r\nimpertinent insolence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Imperthnthn thnthnthn, bootssnout sniffed rudely, as he retreated as\r\nshe threatened as he had come.\r\n\r\nBloom.\r\n\r\nOn her flower frowning miss Douce said:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Most aggravating that young brat is. If he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t conduct himself I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nwring his ear for him a yard long.\r\n\r\nLadylike in exquisite contrast.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Take no notice, miss Kennedy rejoined.\r\n\r\nShe poured in a teacup tea, then back in the teapot tea. They cowered\r\nunder their reef of counter, waiting on footstools, crates upturned,\r\nwaiting for their teas to draw. They pawed their blouses, both of black\r\nsatin, two and nine a yard, waiting for their teas to draw, and two and\r\nseven.\r\n\r\nYes, bronze from anear, by gold from afar, heard steel from anear, hoofs\r\nring from afar, and heard steelhoofs ringhoof ringsteel.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Am I awfully sunburnt?\r\n\r\nMiss bronze unbloused her neck.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94No, said miss Kennedy. It gets brown after. Did you try the borax with\r\nthe cherry laurel water?\r\n\r\nMiss Douce halfstood to see her skin askance in the barmirror\r\ngildedlettered where hock and claret glasses shimmered and in their\r\nmidst a shell.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94And leave it to my hands, she said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Try it with the glycerine, miss Kennedy advised.\r\n\r\nBidding her neck and hands adieu miss Douce\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Those things only bring out a rash, replied, reseated. I asked that old\r\nfogey in Boyd\xe2\x80\x99s for something for my skin.\r\n\r\nMiss Kennedy, pouring now a fulldrawn tea, grimaced and prayed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94O, don\xe2\x80\x99t remind me of him for mercy\xe2\x80\x99 sake!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94But wait till I tell you, miss Douce entreated.\r\n\r\nSweet tea miss Kennedy having poured with milk plugged both two ears\r\nwith little fingers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94No, don\xe2\x80\x99t, she cried.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I won\xe2\x80\x99t listen, she cried.\r\n\r\nBut Bloom?\r\n\r\nMiss Douce grunted in snuffy fogey\xe2\x80\x99s tone:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94For your what? says he.\r\n\r\nMiss Kennedy unplugged her ears to hear, to speak: but said, but prayed\r\nagain:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Don\xe2\x80\x99t let me think of him or I\xe2\x80\x99ll expire. The hideous old wretch! That\r\nnight in the Antient Concert Rooms.\r\n\r\nShe sipped distastefully her brew, hot tea, a sip, sipped, sweet tea.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Here he was, miss Douce said, cocking her bronze head three quarters,\r\nruffling her nosewings. Hufa! Hufa!\r\n\r\nShrill shriek of laughter sprang from miss Kennedy\xe2\x80\x99s throat. Miss Douce\r\nhuffed and snorted down her nostrils that quivered imperthnthn like a\r\nsnout in quest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94O! shrieking, miss Kennedy cried. Will you ever forget his goggle eye?\r\n\r\nMiss Douce chimed in in deep bronze laughter, shouting:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94And your other eye!\r\n\r\nBloowhose dark eye read Aaron Figatner\xe2\x80\x99s name. Why do I always think\r\nFigather? Gathering figs, I think. And Prosper Lor\xc3\xa9\xe2\x80\x99s huguenot name.\r\nBy Bassi\xe2\x80\x99s blessed virgins Bloom\xe2\x80\x99s dark eyes went by. Bluerobed, white\r\nunder, come to me. God they believe she is: or goddess. Those today. I\r\ncould not see. That fellow spoke. A student. After with Dedalus\xe2\x80\x99 son.\r\nHe might be Mulligan. All comely virgins. That brings those rakes of\r\nfellows in: her white.\r\n\r\nBy went his eyes. The sweets of sin. Sweet are the sweets.\r\n\r\nOf sin.\r\n\r\nIn a giggling peal young goldbronze voices blended, Douce with Kennedy\r\nyour other eye. They threw young heads back, bronze gigglegold, to let\r\nfreefly their laughter, screaming, your other, signals to each other,\r\nhigh piercing notes.\r\n\r\nAh, panting, sighing, sighing, ah, fordone, their mirth died down.\r\n\r\nMiss Kennedy lipped her cup again, raised, drank a sip and\r\ngigglegiggled. Miss Douce, bending over the teatray, ruffled again her\r\nnose and rolled droll fattened eyes. Again Kennygiggles, stooping,\r\nher fair pinnacles of hair, stooping, her tortoise napecomb showed,\r\nspluttered out of her mouth her tea, choking in tea and laughter,\r\ncoughing with choking, crying:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94O greasy eyes! Imagine being married to a man like that! she cried.\r\nWith his bit of beard!\r\n\r\nDouce gave full vent to a splendid yell, a full yell of full woman,\r\ndelight, joy, indignation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Married to the greasy nose! she yelled.\r\n\r\nShrill, with deep laughter, after, gold after bronze, they urged each\r\neach to peal after peal, ringing in changes, bronzegold, goldbronze,\r\nshrilldeep, to laughter after laughter. And then laughed more. Greasy I\r\nknows. Exhausted, breathless, their shaken heads they laid, braided and\r\npinnacled by glossycombed, against the counterledge. All flushed (O!),\r\npanting, sweating (O!), all breathless.\r\n\r\nMarried to Bloom, to greaseabloom.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94O saints above! miss Douce said, sighed above her jumping rose. I\r\nwished I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t laughed so much. I feel all wet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94O, miss Douce! miss Kennedy protested. You horrid thing!\r\n\r\nAnd flushed yet more (you horrid!), more goldenly.\r\n\r\nBy Cantwell\xe2\x80\x99s offices roved Greaseabloom, by Ceppi\xe2\x80\x99s virgins, bright of\r\ntheir oils. Nannetti\xe2\x80\x99s father hawked those things about, wheedling at\r\ndoors as I. Religion pays. Must see him for that par. Eat first. I want.\r\nNot yet. At four, she said. Time ever passing. Clockhands turning. On.\r\nWhere eat? The Clarence, Dolphin. On. For Raoul. Eat. If I net five\r\nguineas with those ads. The violet silk petticoats. Not yet. The sweets\r\nof sin.\r\n\r\nFlushed less, still less, goldenly paled.\r\n\r\nInto their bar strolled Mr Dedalus. Chips, picking chips off one of his\r\nrocky thumbnails. Chips. He strolled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94O, welcome back, miss Douce.\r\n\r\nHe held her hand. Enjoyed her holidays?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Tiptop.\r\n\r\nHe hoped she had nice weather in Rostrevor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Gorgeous, she said. Look at the holy show I am. Lying out on the strand\r\nall day.\r\n\r\nBronze whiteness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94That was exceedingly naughty of you, Mr Dedalus told her and pressed\r\nher hand indulgently. Tempting poor simple males.\r\n\r\nMiss Douce of satin douced her arm away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94O go away! she said. You\xe2\x80\x99re very simple, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think.\r\n\r\nHe was.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Well now I am, he mused. I looked so simple in the cradle they\r\nchristened me simple Simon.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94You must have been a doaty, miss Douce made answer. And what did the\r\ndoctor order today?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Well now, he mused, whatever you say yourself. I think I\xe2\x80\x99ll trouble you\r\nfor some fresh water and a half glass of whisky.\r\n\r\nJingle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94With the greatest alacrity, miss Douce agreed.\r\n\r\nWith grace of alacrity towards the mirror gilt Cantrell and Cochrane\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nshe turned herself. With grace she tapped a measure of gold whisky from\r\nher crystal keg. Forth from the skirt of his coat Mr Dedalus brought\r\npouch and pipe. Alacrity she served. He blew through the flue two husky\r\nfifenotes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94By Jove, he mused, I often wanted to see the Mourne mountains. Must\r\nbe a great tonic in the air down there. But a long threatening comes at\r\nlast, they say. Yes. Yes.\r\n\r\nYes. He fingered shreds of hair, her maidenhair, her mermaid\xe2\x80\x99s, into the\r\nbowl. Chips. Shreds. Musing. Mute.\r\n\r\nNone nought said nothing. Yes.\r\n\r\nGaily miss Douce polished a tumbler, trilling:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94O, Idolores, queen of the eastern seas!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Was Mr Lidwell in today?\r\n\r\nIn came Lenehan. Round him peered Lenehan. Mr Bloom reached Essex\r\nbridge. Yes, Mr Bloom crossed bridge of Yessex. To Martha I must write.\r\nBuy paper. Daly\xe2\x80\x99s. Girl there civil. Bloom. Old Bloom. Blue bloom is on\r\nthe rye.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94He was in at lunchtime, miss Douce said.\r\n\r\nLenehan came forward.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Was Mr Boylan looking for me?\r\n\r\nHe asked. She answered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Miss Kennedy, was Mr Boylan in while I was upstairs?\r\n\r\nShe asked. Miss voice of Kennedy answered, a second teacup poised, her\r\ngaze upon a page:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94No. He was not.\r\n\r\nMiss gaze of Kennedy, heard, not seen, read on. Lenehan round the\r\nsandwichbell wound his round body round.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Peep! Who\xe2\x80\x99s in the corner?\r\n\r\nNo glance of Kennedy rewarding him he yet made overtures. To mind her\r\nstops. To read only the black ones: round o and crooked ess.\r\n\r\nJingle jaunty jingle.\r\n\r\nGirlgold she read and did not glance. Take no notice. She took no notice\r\nwhile he read by rote a solfa fable for her, plappering flatly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Ah fox met ah stork. Said thee fox too thee stork: Will you put your\r\nbill down inn my troath and pull upp ah bone?\r\n\r\nHe droned in vain. Miss Douce turned to her tea aside.\r\n\r\nHe sighed aside:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Ah me! O my!\r\n\r\nHe greeted Mr Dedalus and got a nod.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Greetings from the famous son of a famous father.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Who may he be? Mr Dedalus asked.\r\n\r\nLenehan opened most genial arms. Who?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Who may he be? he asked. Can you ask? Stephen, the youthful bard.\r\n\r\nDry.\r\n\r\nMr Dedalus, famous father, laid by his dry filled pipe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I see, he said. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t recognise him for the moment. I hear he is\r\nkeeping very select company. Have you seen him lately?\r\n\r\nHe had.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I quaffed the nectarbowl with him this very day, said Lenehan. In\r\nMooney\xe2\x80\x99s en ville and in Mooney\xe2\x80\x99s sur mer. He had received the rhino for\r\nthe labour of his muse.\r\n\r\nHe smiled at bronze\xe2\x80\x99s teabathed lips, at listening lips and eyes:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94The \xc3\xa9lite of Erin hung upon his lips. The ponderous pundit, Hugh\r\nMacHugh, Dublin\xe2\x80\x99s most brilliant scribe and editor and that minstrel boy\r\nof the wild wet west who is known by the euphonious appellation of the\r\nO\xe2\x80\x99Madden Burke.\r\n\r\nAfter an interval Mr Dedalus raised his grog and\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94That must have been highly diverting, said he. I see.\r\n\r\nHe see. He drank. With faraway mourning mountain eye. Set down his\r\nglass.\r\n\r\nHe looked towards the saloon door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I see you have moved the piano.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94The tuner was in today, miss Douce replied, tuning it for the smoking\r\nconcert and I never heard such an exquisite player.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Is that a fact?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Didn\xe2\x80\x99t he, miss Kennedy? The real classical, you know. And blind too,\r\npoor fellow. Not twenty I\xe2\x80\x99m sure he was.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Is that a fact? Mr Dedalus said.\r\n\r\nHe drank and strayed away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94So sad to look at his face, miss Douce condoled.\r\n\r\nGod\xe2\x80\x99s curse on bitch\xe2\x80\x99s bastard.\r\n\r\nTink to her pity cried a diner\xe2\x80\x99s bell. To the door of the bar and\r\ndiningroom came bald Pat, came bothered Pat, came Pat, waiter of Ormond.\r\nLager for diner. Lager without alacrity she served.\r\n\r\nWith patience Lenehan waited for Boylan with impatience, for\r\njinglejaunty blazes boy.\r\n\r\nUpholding the lid he (who?) gazed in the coffin (coffin?) at the oblique\r\ntriple (piano!) wires. He pressed (the same who pressed indulgently her\r\nhand), soft pedalling, a triple of keys to see the thicknesses of felt\r\nadvancing, to hear the muffled hammerfall in action.\r\n\r\nTwo sheets cream vellum paper one reserve two envelopes when I was in\r\nWisdom Hely\xe2\x80\x99s wise Bloom in Daly\xe2\x80\x99s Henry Flower bought. Are you not\r\nhappy in your home? Flower to console me and a pin cuts lo. Means\r\nsomething, language of flow. Was it a daisy? Innocence that is.\r\nRespectable girl meet after mass. Thanks awfully muchly. Wise Bloom eyed\r\non the door a poster, a swaying mermaid smoking mid nice waves. Smoke\r\nmermaids, coolest whiff of all. Hair streaming: lovelorn. For some man.\r\nFor Raoul. He eyed and saw afar on Essex bridge a gay hat riding on a\r\njaunting car. It is. Again. Third time. Coincidence.\r\n\r\nJingling on supple rubbers it jaunted from the bridge to Ormond quay.\r\nFollow. Risk it. Go quick. At four. Near now. Out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Twopence, sir, the shopgirl dared to say.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Aha... I was forgetting... Excuse...\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94And four.\r\n\r\nAt four she. Winsomely she on Bloohimwhom smiled. Bloo smi qui go.\r\nTernoon. Think you\xe2\x80\x99re the only pebble on the beach? Does that to all.\r\n\r\nFor men.\r\n\r\nIn drowsy silence gold bent on her page.\r\n\r\nFrom the saloon a call came, long in dying. That was a tuningfork the\r\ntuner had that he forgot that he now struck. A call again. That he now\r\npoised that it now throbbed. You hear? It throbbed, pure, purer, softly\r\nand softlier, its buzzing prongs. Longer in dying call.\r\n\r\nPat paid for diner\xe2\x80\x99s popcorked bottle: and over tumbler, tray and\r\npopcorked bottle ere he went he whispered, bald and bothered, with miss\r\nDouce.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94The bright stars fade...\r\n\r\nA voiceless song sang from within, singing:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94... the morn is breaking.\r\n\r\nA duodene of birdnotes chirruped bright treble answer under sensitive\r\nhands. Brightly the keys, all twinkling, linked, all harpsichording,\r\ncalled to a voice to sing the strain of dewy morn, of youth, of love\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nleavetaking, life\xe2\x80\x99s, love\xe2\x80\x99s morn.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94The dewdrops pearl...\r\n\r\nLenehan\xe2\x80\x99s lips over the counter lisped a low whistle of decoy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94But look this way, he said, rose of Castile.\r\n\r\nJingle jaunted by the curb and stopped.\r\n\r\nShe rose and closed her reading, rose of Castile: fretted, forlorn,\r\ndreamily rose.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Did she fall or was she pushed? he asked her.\r\n\r\nShe answered, slighting:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Ask no questions and you\xe2\x80\x99ll hear no lies.\r\n\r\nLike lady, ladylike.\r\n\r\nBlazes Boylan\xe2\x80\x99s smart tan shoes creaked on the barfloor where he strode.\r\nYes, gold from anear by bronze from afar. Lenehan heard and knew and\r\nhailed him:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94See the conquering hero comes.\r\n\r\nBetween the car and window, warily walking, went Bloom, unconquered\r\nhero. See me he might. The seat he sat on: warm. Black wary hecat walked\r\ntowards Richie Goulding\xe2\x80\x99s legal bag, lifted aloft, saluting.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94And I from thee...\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I heard you were round, said Blazes Boylan.\r\n\r\nHe touched to fair miss Kennedy a rim of his slanted straw. She smiled\r\non him. But sister bronze outsmiled her, preening for him her richer\r\nhair, a bosom and a rose.\r\n\r\nSmart Boylan bespoke potions.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94What\xe2\x80\x99s your cry? Glass of bitter? Glass of bitter, please, and a\r\nsloegin for me. Wire in yet?\r\n\r\nNot yet. At four she. Who said four?\r\n\r\nCowley\xe2\x80\x99s red lugs and bulging apple in the door of the sheriff\xe2\x80\x99s office.\r\n\r\nAvoid. Goulding a chance. What is he doing in the Ormond? Car waiting.\r\nWait.\r\n\r\nHello. Where off to? Something to eat? I too was just. In here. What,\r\nOrmond? Best value in Dublin. Is that so? Diningroom. Sit tight there.\r\nSee, not be seen. I think I\xe2\x80\x99ll join you. Come on. Richie led on. Bloom\r\nfollowed bag. Dinner fit for a prince.\r\n\r\nMiss Douce reached high to take a flagon, stretching her satin arm, her\r\nbust, that all but burst, so high.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94O! O! jerked Lenehan, gasping at each stretch. O!\r\n\r\nBut easily she seized her prey and led it low in triumph.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Why don\xe2\x80\x99t you grow? asked Blazes Boylan.\r\n\r\nShebronze, dealing from her oblique jar thick syrupy liquor for his\r\nlips, looked as it flowed (flower in his coat: who gave him?), and\r\nsyrupped with her voice:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Fine goods in small parcels.\r\n\r\nThat is to say she. Neatly she poured slowsyrupy sloe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Here\xe2\x80\x99s fortune, Blazes said.\r\n\r\nHe pitched a broad coin down. Coin rang.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Hold on, said Lenehan, till I...\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Fortune, he wished, lifting his bubbled ale.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Sceptre will win in a canter, he said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I plunged a bit, said Boylan winking and drinking. Not on my own, you\r\nknow. Fancy of a friend of mine.\r\n\r\nLenehan still drank and grinned at his tilted ale and at miss Douce\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlips that all but hummed, not shut, the oceansong her lips had trilled.\r\nIdolores. The eastern seas.\r\n\r\nClock whirred. Miss Kennedy passed their way (flower, wonder who gave),\r\nbearing away teatray. Clock clacked.\r\n\r\nMiss Douce took Boylan\xe2\x80\x99s coin, struck boldly the cashregister. It\r\nclanged. Clock clacked. Fair one of Egypt teased and sorted in the till\r\nand hummed and handed coins in change. Look to the west. A clack. For\r\nme.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94What time is that? asked Blazes Boylan. Four?\r\n\r\nO\xe2\x80\x99clock.\r\n\r\nLenehan, small eyes ahunger on her humming, bust ahumming, tugged Blazes\r\nBoylan\xe2\x80\x99s elbowsleeve.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Let\xe2\x80\x99s hear the time, he said.\r\n\r\nThe bag of Goulding, Collis, Ward led Bloom by ryebloom flowered tables.\r\nAimless he chose with agitated aim, bald Pat attending, a table near\r\nthe door. Be near. At four. Has he forgotten? Perhaps a trick. Not come:\r\nwhet appetite. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t do. Wait, wait. Pat, waiter, waited.\r\n\r\nSparkling bronze azure eyed Blazure\xe2\x80\x99s skyblue bow and eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Go on, pressed Lenehan. There\xe2\x80\x99s no-one. He never heard.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94... to Flora\xe2\x80\x99s lips did hie.\r\n\r\nHigh, a high note pealed in the treble clear.\r\n\r\nBronzedouce communing with her rose that sank and rose sought Blazes\r\nBoylan\xe2\x80\x99s flower and eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Please, please.\r\n\r\nHe pleaded over returning phrases of avowal.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I could not leave thee...\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Afterwits, miss Douce promised coyly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94No, now, urged Lenehan. Sonnez la cloche! O do! There\xe2\x80\x99s no-one.\r\n\r\nShe looked. Quick. Miss Kenn out of earshot. Sudden bent. Two kindling\r\nfaces watched her bend.\r\n\r\nQuavering the chords strayed from the air, found it again, lost chord,\r\nand lost and found it, faltering.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Go on! Do! Sonnez!\r\n\r\nBending, she nipped a peak of skirt above her knee. Delayed. Taunted\r\nthem still, bending, suspending, with wilful eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Sonnez!\r\n\r\nSmack. She set free sudden in rebound her nipped elastic garter\r\nsmackwarm against her smackable a woman\xe2\x80\x99s warmhosed thigh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94La cloche! cried gleeful Lenehan. Trained by owner. No sawdust there.\r\n\r\nShe smilesmirked supercilious (wept! aren\xe2\x80\x99t men?), but, lightward\r\ngliding, mild she smiled on Boylan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94You\xe2\x80\x99re the essence of vulgarity, she in gliding said.\r\n\r\nBoylan, eyed, eyed. Tossed to fat lips his chalice, drank off his\r\nchalice tiny, sucking the last fat violet syrupy drops. His spellbound\r\neyes went after, after her gliding head as it went down the bar by\r\nmirrors, gilded arch for ginger ale, hock and claret glasses shimmering,\r\na spiky shell, where it concerted, mirrored, bronze with sunnier bronze.\r\n\r\nYes, bronze from anearby.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94... Sweetheart, goodbye!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99m off, said Boylan with impatience.\r\n\r\nHe slid his chalice brisk away, grasped his change.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Wait a shake, begged Lenehan, drinking quickly. I wanted to tell you.\r\nTom Rochford...\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Come on to blazes, said Blazes Boylan, going.\r\n\r\nLenehan gulped to go.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Got the horn or what? he said. Wait. I\xe2\x80\x99m coming.\r\n\r\nHe followed the hasty creaking shoes but stood by nimbly by the\r\nthreshold, saluting forms, a bulky with a slender.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94How do you do, Mr Dollard?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Eh? How do? How do? Ben Dollard\xe2\x80\x99s vague bass answered, turning an\r\ninstant from Father Cowley\xe2\x80\x99s woe. He won\xe2\x80\x99t give you any trouble, Bob.\r\nAlf Bergan will speak to the long fellow. We\xe2\x80\x99ll put a barleystraw in\r\nthat Judas Iscariot\xe2\x80\x99s ear this time.\r\n\r\nSighing Mr Dedalus came through the saloon, a finger soothing an eyelid.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Hoho, we will, Ben Dollard yodled jollily. Come on, Simon. Give us a\r\nditty. We heard the piano.\r\n\r\nBald Pat, bothered waiter, waited for drink orders. Power for Richie.\r\nAnd Bloom? Let me see. Not make him walk twice. His corns. Four now. How\r\nwarm this black is. Course nerves a bit. Refracts (is it?) heat. Let me\r\nsee. Cider. Yes, bottle of cider.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94What\xe2\x80\x99s that? Mr Dedalus said. I was only vamping, man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Come on, come on, Ben Dollard called. Begone dull care. Come, Bob.\r\n\r\nHe ambled Dollard, bulky slops, before them (hold that fellow with the:\r\nhold him now) into the saloon. He plumped him Dollard on the stool. His\r\ngouty paws plumped chords. Plumped, stopped abrupt.\r\n\r\nBald Pat in the doorway met tealess gold returning. Bothered, he wanted\r\nPower and cider. Bronze by the window, watched, bronze from afar.\r\n\r\nJingle a tinkle jaunted.\r\n\r\nBloom heard a jing, a little sound. He\xe2\x80\x99s off. Light sob of breath Bloom\r\nsighed on the silent bluehued flowers. Jingling. He\xe2\x80\x99s gone. Jingle.\r\nHear.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Love and War, Ben, Mr Dedalus said. God be with old times.\r\n\r\nMiss Douce\xe2\x80\x99s brave eyes, unregarded, turned from the crossblind, smitten\r\nby sunlight. Gone. Pensive (who knows?), smitten (the smiting light),\r\nshe lowered the dropblind with a sliding cord. She drew down pensive\r\n(why did he go so quick when I?) about her bronze, over the bar where\r\nbald stood by sister gold, inexquisite contrast, contrast inexquisite\r\nnonexquisite, slow cool dim seagreen sliding depth of shadow, eau de\r\nNil.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Poor old Goodwin was the pianist that night, Father Cowley reminded\r\nthem. There was a slight difference of opinion between himself and the\r\nCollard grand.\r\n\r\nThere was.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94A symposium all his own, Mr Dedalus said. The devil wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t stop him.\r\nHe was a crotchety old fellow in the primary stage of drink.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94God, do you remember? Ben bulky Dollard said, turning from the punished\r\nkeyboard. And by Japers I had no wedding garment.\r\n\r\nThey laughed all three. He had no wed. All trio laughed. No wedding\r\ngarment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Our friend Bloom turned in handy that night, Mr Dedalus said. Where\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmy pipe, by the way?\r\n\r\nHe wandered back to the bar to the lost chord pipe. Bald Pat carried two\r\ndiners\xe2\x80\x99 drinks, Richie and Poldy. And Father Cowley laughed again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I saved the situation, Ben, I think.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94You did, averred Ben Dollard. I remember those tight trousers too. That\r\nwas a brilliant idea, Bob.\r\n\r\nFather Cowley blushed to his brilliant purply lobes. He saved the situa.\r\nTight trou. Brilliant ide.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I knew he was on the rocks, he said. The wife was playing the piano in\r\nthe coffee palace on Saturdays for a very trifling consideration and\r\nwho was it gave me the wheeze she was doing the other business? Do you\r\nremember? We had to search all Holles street to find them till the chap\r\nin Keogh\xe2\x80\x99s gave us the number. Remember?\r\n\r\nBen remembered, his broad visage wondering.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94By God, she had some luxurious operacloaks and things there.\r\n\r\nMr Dedalus wandered back, pipe in hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Merrion square style. Balldresses, by God, and court dresses. He\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t take any money either. What? Any God\xe2\x80\x99s quantity of cocked hats\r\nand boleros and trunkhose. What?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Ay, ay, Mr Dedalus nodded. Mrs Marion Bloom has left off clothes of all\r\ndescriptions.\r\n\r\nJingle jaunted down the quays. Blazes sprawled on bounding tyres.\r\n\r\nLiver and bacon. Steak and kidney pie. Right, sir. Right, Pat.\r\n\r\nMrs Marion. Met him pike hoses. Smell of burn. Of Paul de Kock. Nice\r\nname he.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94What\xe2\x80\x99s this her name was? A buxom lassy. Marion...\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Tweedy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Yes. Is she alive?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94And kicking.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94She was a daughter of...\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Daughter of the regiment.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Yes, begad. I remember the old drummajor.\r\n\r\nMr Dedalus struck, whizzed, lit, puffed savoury puff after\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Irish? I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, faith. Is she, Simon?\r\n\r\nPuff after stiff, a puff, strong, savoury, crackling.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Buccinator muscle is... What?... Bit rusty... O, she is... My Irish\r\nMolly, O.\r\n\r\nHe puffed a pungent plumy blast.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94From the rock of Gibraltar... all the way.\r\n\r\nThey pined in depth of ocean shadow, gold by the beerpull, bronze\r\nby maraschino, thoughtful all two. Mina Kennedy, 4 Lismore terrace,\r\nDrumcondra with Idolores, a queen, Dolores, silent.\r\n\r\nPat served, uncovered dishes. Leopold cut liverslices. As said before he\r\nate with relish the inner organs, nutty gizzards, fried cods\xe2\x80\x99 roes while\r\nRichie Goulding, Collis, Ward ate steak and kidney, steak then kidney,\r\nbite by bite of pie he ate Bloom ate they ate.\r\n\r\nBloom with Goulding, married in silence, ate. Dinners fit for princes.\r\n\r\nBy Bachelor\xe2\x80\x99s walk jogjaunty jingled Blazes Boylan, bachelor, in sun in\r\nheat, mare\xe2\x80\x99s glossy rump atrot, with flick of whip, on bounding tyres:\r\nsprawled, warmseated, Boylan impatience, ardentbold. Horn. Have you the?\r\nHorn. Have you the? Haw haw horn.\r\n\r\nOver their voices Dollard bassooned attack, booming over bombarding\r\nchords:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94When love absorbs my ardent soul...\r\n\r\nRoll of Bensoulbenjamin rolled to the quivery loveshivery roofpanes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94War! War! cried Father Cowley. You\xe2\x80\x99re the warrior.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94So I am, Ben Warrior laughed. I was thinking of your landlord. Love or\r\nmoney.\r\n\r\nHe stopped. He wagged huge beard, huge face over his blunder huge.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Sure, you\xe2\x80\x99d burst the tympanum of her ear, man, Mr Dedalus said through\r\nsmoke aroma, with an organ like yours.\r\n\r\nIn bearded abundant laughter Dollard shook upon the keyboard. He would.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Not to mention another membrane, Father Cowley added. Half time, Ben.\r\nAmoroso ma non troppo. Let me there.\r\n\r\nMiss Kennedy served two gentlemen with tankards of cool stout. She\r\npassed a remark. It was indeed, first gentleman said, beautiful weather.\r\nThey drank cool stout. Did she know where the lord lieutenant was going?\r\nAnd heard steelhoofs ringhoof ring. No, she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t say. But it would\r\nbe in the paper. O, she need not trouble. No trouble. She waved about\r\nher outspread Independent, searching, the lord lieutenant, her pinnacles\r\nof hair slowmoving, lord lieuten. Too much trouble, first gentleman\r\nsaid. O, not in the least. Way he looked that. Lord lieutenant. Gold by\r\nbronze heard iron steel.\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x94............ my ardent soul\r\n     I care not foror the morrow.\r\n\r\nIn liver gravy Bloom mashed mashed potatoes. Love and War someone is.\r\nBen Dollard\xe2\x80\x99s famous. Night he ran round to us to borrow a dress suit\r\nfor that concert. Trousers tight as a drum on him. Musical porkers.\r\nMolly did laugh when he went out. Threw herself back across the bed,\r\nscreaming, kicking. With all his belongings on show. O saints above,\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m drenched! O, the women in the front row! O, I never laughed so many!\r\nWell, of course that\xe2\x80\x99s what gives him the base barreltone. For instance\r\neunuchs. Wonder who\xe2\x80\x99s playing. Nice touch. Must be Cowley. Musical.\r\nKnows whatever note you play. Bad breath he has, poor chap. Stopped.\r\n\r\nMiss Douce, engaging, Lydia Douce, bowed to suave solicitor, George\r\nLidwell, gentleman, entering. Good afternoon. She gave her moist (a\r\nlady\xe2\x80\x99s) hand to his firm clasp. Afternoon. Yes, she was back. To the old\r\ndingdong again.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Your friends are inside, Mr Lidwell.\r\n\r\nGeorge Lidwell, suave, solicited, held a lydiahand.\r\n\r\nBloom ate liv as said before. Clean here at least. That chap in the\r\nBurton, gummy with gristle. No-one here: Goulding and I. Clean tables,\r\nflowers, mitres of napkins. Pat to and fro. Bald Pat. Nothing to do.\r\nBest value in Dub.\r\n\r\nPiano again. Cowley it is. Way he sits in to it, like one together,\r\nmutual understanding. Tiresome shapers scraping fiddles, eye on the\r\nbowend, sawing the cello, remind you of toothache. Her high long snore.\r\nNight we were in the box. Trombone under blowing like a grampus, between\r\nthe acts, other brass chap unscrewing, emptying spittle. Conductor\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlegs too, bagstrousers, jiggedy jiggedy. Do right to hide them.\r\n\r\nJiggedy jingle jaunty jaunty.\r\n\r\nOnly the harp. Lovely. Gold glowering light. Girl touched it. Poop of a\r\nlovely. Gravy\xe2\x80\x99s rather good fit for a. Golden ship. Erin. The harp that\r\nonce or twice. Cool hands. Ben Howth, the rhododendrons. We are their\r\nharps. I. He. Old. Young.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Ah, I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t, man, Mr Dedalus said, shy, listless.\r\n\r\nStrongly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Go on, blast you! Ben Dollard growled. Get it out in bits.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94M\xe2\x80\x99appari, Simon, Father Cowley said.\r\n\r\nDown stage he strode some paces, grave, tall in affliction, his long\r\narms outheld. Hoarsely the apple of his throat hoarsed softly. Softly he\r\nsang to a dusty seascape there: A Last Farewell. A headland, a ship, a\r\nsail upon the billows. Farewell. A lovely girl, her veil awave upon the\r\nwind upon the headland, wind around her.\r\n\r\nCowley sang:\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x94M\xe2\x80\x99appari tutt\xe2\x80\x99amor:\r\n     Il mio sguardo l\xe2\x80\x99incontr...\r\n\r\nShe waved, unhearing Cowley, her veil, to one departing, dear one, to\r\nwind, love, speeding sail, return.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Go on, Simon.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Ah, sure, my dancing days are done, Ben... Well...\r\n\r\nMr Dedalus laid his pipe to rest beside the tuningfork and, sitting,\r\ntouched the obedient keys.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94No, Simon, Father Cowley turned. Play it in the original. One flat.\r\n\r\nThe keys, obedient, rose higher, told, faltered, confessed, confused.\r\n\r\nUp stage strode Father Cowley.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Here, Simon, I\xe2\x80\x99ll accompany you, he said. Get up.\r\n\r\nBy Graham Lemon\xe2\x80\x99s pineapple rock, by Elvery\xe2\x80\x99s elephant jingly jogged.\r\n\r\nSteak, kidney, liver, mashed, at meat fit for princes sat princes Bloom\r\nand Goulding. Princes at meat they raised and drank, Power and cider.\r\n\r\nMost beautiful tenor air ever written, Richie said: Sonnambula. He\r\nheard Joe Maas sing that one night. Ah, what M\xe2\x80\x99Guckin! Yes. In his way.\r\nChoirboy style. Maas was the boy. Massboy. A lyrical tenor if you like.\r\nNever forget it. Never.\r\n\r\nTenderly Bloom over liverless bacon saw the tightened features strain.\r\nBackache he. Bright\xe2\x80\x99s bright eye. Next item on the programme. Paying the\r\npiper. Pills, pounded bread, worth a guinea a box. Stave it off awhile.\r\nSings too: Down among the dead men. Appropriate. Kidney pie. Sweets to\r\nthe. Not making much hand of it. Best value in. Characteristic of him.\r\nPower. Particular about his drink. Flaw in the glass, fresh Vartry\r\nwater. Fecking matches from counters to save. Then squander a sovereign\r\nin dribs and drabs. And when he\xe2\x80\x99s wanted not a farthing. Screwed\r\nrefusing to pay his fare. Curious types.\r\n\r\nNever would Richie forget that night. As long as he lived: never. In the\r\ngods of the old Royal with little Peake. And when the first note.\r\n\r\nSpeech paused on Richie\xe2\x80\x99s lips.\r\n\r\nComing out with a whopper now. Rhapsodies about damn all. Believes his\r\nown lies. Does really. Wonderful liar. But want a good memory.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Which air is that? asked Leopold Bloom.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94All is lost now.\r\n\r\nRichie cocked his lips apout. A low incipient note sweet banshee\r\nmurmured: all. A thrush. A throstle. His breath, birdsweet, good teeth\r\nhe\xe2\x80\x99s proud of, fluted with plaintive woe. Is lost. Rich sound. Two\r\nnotes in one there. Blackbird I heard in the hawthorn valley. Taking my\r\nmotives he twined and turned them. All most too new call is lost in all.\r\nEcho. How sweet the answer. How is that done? All lost now. Mournful he\r\nwhistled. Fall, surrender, lost.\r\n\r\nBloom bent leopold ear, turning a fringe of doyley down under the vase.\r\nOrder. Yes, I remember. Lovely air. In sleep she went to him. Innocence\r\nin the moon. Brave. Don\xe2\x80\x99t know their danger. Still hold her back. Call\r\nname. Touch water. Jingle jaunty. Too late. She longed to go. That\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwhy. Woman. As easy stop the sea. Yes: all is lost.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94A beautiful air, said Bloom lost Leopold. I know it well.\r\n\r\nNever in all his life had Richie Goulding.\r\n\r\nHe knows it well too. Or he feels. Still harping on his daughter. Wise\r\nchild that knows her father, Dedalus said. Me?\r\n\r\nBloom askance over liverless saw. Face of the all is lost. Rollicking\r\nRichie once. Jokes old stale now. Wagging his ear. Napkinring in his\r\neye. Now begging letters he sends his son with. Crosseyed Walter sir I\r\ndid sir. Wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t trouble only I was expecting some money. Apologise.\r\n\r\nPiano again. Sounds better than last time I heard. Tuned probably.\r\nStopped again.\r\n\r\nDollard and Cowley still urged the lingering singer out with it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94With it, Simon.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94It, Simon.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Ladies and gentlemen, I am most deeply obliged by your kind\r\nsolicitations.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94It, Simon.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I have no money but if you will lend me your attention I shall\r\nendeavour to sing to you of a heart bowed down.\r\n\r\nBy the sandwichbell in screening shadow Lydia, her bronze and rose, a\r\nlady\xe2\x80\x99s grace, gave and withheld: as in cool glaucous eau de Nil Mina to\r\ntankards two her pinnacles of gold.\r\n\r\nThe harping chords of prelude closed. A chord, longdrawn, expectant,\r\ndrew a voice away.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94When first I saw that form endearing...\r\n\r\nRichie turned.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Si Dedalus\xe2\x80\x99 voice, he said.\r\n\r\nBraintipped, cheek touched with flame, they listened feeling that flow\r\nendearing flow over skin limbs human heart soul spine. Bloom signed to\r\nPat, bald Pat is a waiter hard of hearing, to set ajar the door of the\r\nbar. The door of the bar. So. That will do. Pat, waiter, waited, waiting\r\nto hear, for he was hard of hear by the door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Sorrow from me seemed to depart.\r\n\r\nThrough the hush of air a voice sang to them, low, not rain, not leaves\r\nin murmur, like no voice of strings or reeds or whatdoyoucallthem\r\ndulcimers touching their still ears with words, still hearts of their\r\neach his remembered lives. Good, good to hear: sorrow from them each\r\nseemed to from both depart when first they heard. When first they saw,\r\nlost Richie Poldy, mercy of beauty, heard from a person wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t expect\r\nit in the least, her first merciful lovesoft oftloved word.\r\n\r\nLove that is singing: love\xe2\x80\x99s old sweet song. Bloom unwound slowly the\r\nelastic band of his packet. Love\xe2\x80\x99s old sweet sonnez la gold. Bloom wound\r\na skein round four forkfingers, stretched it, relaxed, and wound it\r\nround his troubled double, fourfold, in octave, gyved them fast.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Full of hope and all delighted...\r\n\r\nTenors get women by the score. Increase their flow. Throw flower at his\r\nfeet. When will we meet? My head it simply. Jingle all delighted. He\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t sing for tall hats. Your head it simply swurls. Perfumed for him.\r\nWhat perfume does your wife? I want to know. Jing. Stop. Knock. Last\r\nlook at mirror always before she answers the door. The hall. There? How\r\ndo you? I do well. There? What? Or? Phial of cachous, kissing comfits,\r\nin her satchel. Yes? Hands felt for the opulent.\r\n\r\nAlas the voice rose, sighing, changed: loud, full, shining, proud.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94But alas, \xe2\x80\x98twas idle dreaming...\r\n\r\nGlorious tone he has still. Cork air softer also their brogue. Silly\r\nman! Could have made oceans of money. Singing wrong words. Wore out\r\nhis wife: now sings. But hard to tell. Only the two themselves. If he\r\ndoesn\xe2\x80\x99t break down. Keep a trot for the avenue. His hands and feet sing\r\ntoo. Drink. Nerves overstrung. Must be abstemious to sing. Jenny Lind\r\nsoup: stock, sage, raw eggs, half pint of cream. For creamy dreamy.\r\n\r\nTenderness it welled: slow, swelling, full it throbbed. That\xe2\x80\x99s the chat.\r\nHa, give! Take! Throb, a throb, a pulsing proud erect.\r\n\r\nWords? Music? No: it\xe2\x80\x99s what\xe2\x80\x99s behind.\r\n\r\nBloom looped, unlooped, noded, disnoded.\r\n\r\nBloom. Flood of warm jamjam lickitup secretness flowed to flow in music\r\nout, in desire, dark to lick flow invading. Tipping her tepping her\r\ntapping her topping her. Tup. Pores to dilate dilating. Tup. The joy\r\nthe feel the warm the. Tup. To pour o\xe2\x80\x99er sluices pouring gushes. Flood,\r\ngush, flow, joygush, tupthrob. Now! Language of love.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94... ray of hope is...\r\n\r\nBeaming. Lydia for Lidwell squeak scarcely hear so ladylike the muse\r\nunsqueaked a ray of hopk.\r\n\r\nMartha it is. Coincidence. Just going to write. Lionel\xe2\x80\x99s song.\r\nLovely name you have. Can\xe2\x80\x99t write. Accept my little pres. Play on her\r\nheartstrings pursestrings too. She\xe2\x80\x99s a. I called you naughty boy. Still\r\nthe name: Martha. How strange! Today.\r\n\r\nThe voice of Lionel returned, weaker but unwearied. It sang again to\r\nRichie Poldy Lydia Lidwell also sang to Pat open mouth ear waiting to\r\nwait. How first he saw that form endearing, how sorrow seemed to part,\r\nhow look, form, word charmed him Gould Lidwell, won Pat Bloom\xe2\x80\x99s heart.\r\n\r\nWish I could see his face, though. Explain better. Why the barber in\r\nDrago\xe2\x80\x99s always looked my face when I spoke his face in the glass. Still\r\nhear it better here than in the bar though farther.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Each graceful look...\r\n\r\nFirst night when first I saw her at Mat Dillon\xe2\x80\x99s in Terenure. Yellow,\r\nblack lace she wore. Musical chairs. We two the last. Fate. After her.\r\nFate. Round and round slow. Quick round. We two. All looked. Halt. Down\r\nshe sat. All ousted looked. Lips laughing. Yellow knees.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Charmed my eye...\r\n\r\nSinging. Waiting she sang. I turned her music. Full voice of perfume\r\nof what perfume does your lilactrees. Bosom I saw, both full, throat\r\nwarbling. First I saw. She thanked me. Why did she me? Fate. Spanishy\r\neyes. Under a peartree alone patio this hour in old Madrid one side in\r\nshadow Dolores shedolores. At me. Luring. Ah, alluring.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Martha! Ah, Martha!\r\n\r\nQuitting all languor Lionel cried in grief, in cry of passion dominant\r\nto love to return with deepening yet with rising chords of harmony. In\r\ncry of lionel loneliness that she should know, must martha feel. For\r\nonly her he waited. Where? Here there try there here all try where.\r\nSomewhere.\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x94Co-ome, thou lost one!\r\n     Co-ome, thou dear one!\r\n\r\nAlone. One love. One hope. One comfort me. Martha, chestnote, return!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Come!\r\n\r\nIt soared, a bird, it held its flight, a swift pure cry, soar silver orb\r\nit leaped serene, speeding, sustained, to come, don\xe2\x80\x99t spin it out too\r\nlong long breath he breath long life, soaring high, high resplendent,\r\naflame, crowned, high in the effulgence symbolistic, high, of the\r\netherial bosom, high, of the high vast irradiation everywhere all\r\nsoaring all around about the all, the endlessnessnessness...\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94To me!\r\n\r\nSiopold!\r\n\r\nConsumed.\r\n\r\nCome. Well sung. All clapped. She ought to. Come. To me, to him, to her,\r\nyou too, me, us.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Bravo! Clapclap. Good man, Simon. Clappyclapclap. Encore! Clapclipclap\r\nclap. Sound as a bell. Bravo, Simon! Clapclopclap. Encore, enclap, said,\r\ncried, clapped all, Ben Dollard, Lydia Douce, George Lidwell, Pat, Mina\r\nKennedy, two gentlemen with two tankards, Cowley, first gent with tank\r\nand bronze Miss Douce and gold Miss Mina.\r\n\r\nBlazes Boylan\xe2\x80\x99s smart tan shoes creaked on the barfloor, said before.\r\nJingle by monuments of sir John Gray, Horatio onehandled Nelson,\r\nreverend father Theobald Mathew, jaunted, as said before just now.\r\nAtrot, in heat, heatseated. Cloche. Sonnez la. Cloche. Sonnez la. Slower\r\nthe mare went up the hill by the Rotunda, Rutland square. Too slow for\r\nBoylan, blazes Boylan, impatience Boylan, joggled the mare.\r\n\r\nAn afterclang of Cowley\xe2\x80\x99s chords closed, died on the air made richer.\r\n\r\nAnd Richie Goulding drank his Power and Leopold Bloom his cider drank,\r\nLidwell his Guinness, second gentleman said they would partake of two\r\nmore tankards if she did not mind. Miss Kennedy smirked, disserving,\r\ncoral lips, at first, at second. She did not mind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Seven days in jail, Ben Dollard said, on bread and water. Then you\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nsing, Simon, like a garden thrush.\r\n\r\nLionel Simon, singer, laughed. Father Bob Cowley played. Mina Kennedy\r\nserved. Second gentleman paid. Tom Kernan strutted in. Lydia, admired,\r\nadmired. But Bloom sang dumb.\r\n\r\nAdmiring.\r\n\r\nRichie, admiring, descanted on that man\xe2\x80\x99s glorious voice. He remembered\r\none night long ago. Never forget that night. Si sang \xe2\x80\x98Twas rank and\r\nfame: in Ned Lambert\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98twas. Good God he never heard in all his life a\r\nnote like that he never did then false one we had better part so clear\r\nso God he never heard since love lives not a clinking voice lives not\r\nask Lambert he can tell you too.\r\n\r\nGoulding, a flush struggling in his pale, told Mr Bloom, face of the\r\nnight, Si in Ned Lambert\xe2\x80\x99s, Dedalus house, sang \xe2\x80\x98Twas rank and fame.\r\n\r\nHe, Mr Bloom, listened while he, Richie Goulding, told him, Mr Bloom, of\r\nthe night he, Richie, heard him, Si Dedalus, sing \xe2\x80\x98Twas rank and fame in\r\nhis, Ned Lambert\xe2\x80\x99s, house.\r\n\r\nBrothers-in-law: relations. We never speak as we pass by. Rift in the\r\nlute I think. Treats him with scorn. See. He admires him all the more.\r\nThe night Si sang. The human voice, two tiny silky chords, wonderful,\r\nmore than all others.\r\n\r\nThat voice was a lamentation. Calmer now. It\xe2\x80\x99s in the silence after you\r\nfeel you hear. Vibrations. Now silent air.\r\n\r\nBloom ungyved his crisscrossed hands and with slack fingers plucked the\r\nslender catgut thong. He drew and plucked. It buzz, it twanged. While\r\nGoulding talked of Barraclough\xe2\x80\x99s voice production, while Tom Kernan,\r\nharking back in a retrospective sort of arrangement talked to listening\r\nFather Cowley, who played a voluntary, who nodded as he played. While\r\nbig Ben Dollard talked with Simon Dedalus, lighting, who nodded as he\r\nsmoked, who smoked.\r\n\r\nThou lost one. All songs on that theme. Yet more Bloom stretched his\r\nstring. Cruel it seems. Let people get fond of each other: lure them on.\r\nThen tear asunder. Death. Explos. Knock on the head. Outtohelloutofthat.\r\nHuman life. Dignam. Ugh, that rat\xe2\x80\x99s tail wriggling! Five bob I gave.\r\nCorpus paradisum. Corncrake croaker: belly like a poisoned pup. Gone.\r\nThey sing. Forgotten. I too. And one day she with. Leave her: get\r\ntired. Suffer then. Snivel. Big spanishy eyes goggling at nothing. Her\r\nwavy heavey hair uncombed.\r\n\r\nYet too much happy bores. He stretched more, more. Are you not happy in\r\nyour? Twang. It snapped.\r\n\r\nJingle into Dorset street.\r\n\r\nMiss Douce withdrew her satiny arm, reproachful, pleased.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Don\xe2\x80\x99t make half so free, said she, till we are better acquainted.\r\n\r\nGeorge Lidwell told her really and truly: but she did not believe.\r\n\r\nFirst gentleman told Mina that was so. She asked him was that so. And\r\nsecond tankard told her so. That that was so.\r\n\r\nMiss Douce, miss Lydia, did not believe: miss Kennedy, Mina, did not\r\nbelieve: George Lidwell, no: miss Dou did not: the first, the first:\r\ngent with the tank: believe, no, no: did not, miss Kenn: Lidlydiawell:\r\nthe tank.\r\n\r\nBetter write it here. Quills in the postoffice chewed and twisted.\r\n\r\nBald Pat at a sign drew nigh. A pen and ink. He went. A pad. He went. A\r\npad to blot. He heard, deaf Pat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Yes, Mr Bloom said, teasing the curling catgut line. It certainly is.\r\nFew lines will do. My present. All that Italian florid music is. Who\r\nis this wrote? Know the name you know better. Take out sheet notepaper,\r\nenvelope: unconcerned. It\xe2\x80\x99s so characteristic.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Grandest number in the whole opera, Goulding said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94It is, Bloom said.\r\n\r\nNumbers it is. All music when you come to think. Two multiplied by two\r\ndivided by half is twice one. Vibrations: chords those are. One plus two\r\nplus six is seven. Do anything you like with figures juggling. Always\r\nfind out this equal to that. Symmetry under a cemetery wall. He doesn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nsee my mourning. Callous: all for his own gut. Musemathematics. And you\r\nthink you\xe2\x80\x99re listening to the etherial. But suppose you said it like:\r\nMartha, seven times nine minus x is thirtyfive thousand. Fall quite\r\nflat. It\xe2\x80\x99s on account of the sounds it is.\r\n\r\nInstance he\xe2\x80\x99s playing now. Improvising. Might be what you like, till you\r\nhear the words. Want to listen sharp. Hard. Begin all right: then hear\r\nchords a bit off: feel lost a bit. In and out of sacks, over barrels,\r\nthrough wirefences, obstacle race. Time makes the tune. Question of mood\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99re in. Still always nice to hear. Except scales up and down, girls\r\nlearning. Two together nextdoor neighbours. Ought to invent dummy pianos\r\nfor that. Blumenlied I bought for her. The name. Playing it slow, a\r\ngirl, night I came home, the girl. Door of the stables near Cecilia\r\nstreet. Milly no taste. Queer because we both, I mean.\r\n\r\nBald deaf Pat brought quite flat pad ink. Pat set with ink pen quite\r\nflat pad. Pat took plate dish knife fork. Pat went.\r\n\r\nIt was the only language Mr Dedalus said to Ben. He heard them as a\r\nboy in Ringabella, Crosshaven, Ringabella, singing their barcaroles.\r\nQueenstown harbour full of Italian ships. Walking, you know, Ben, in the\r\nmoonlight with those earthquake hats. Blending their voices. God, such\r\nmusic, Ben. Heard as a boy. Cross Ringabella haven mooncarole.\r\n\r\nSour pipe removed he held a shield of hand beside his lips that cooed a\r\nmoonlight nightcall, clear from anear, a call from afar, replying.\r\n\r\nDown the edge of his Freeman baton ranged Bloom\xe2\x80\x99s, your other eye,\r\nscanning for where did I see that. Callan, Coleman, Dignam Patrick.\r\nHeigho! Heigho! Fawcett. Aha! Just I was looking...\r\n\r\nHope he\xe2\x80\x99s not looking, cute as a rat. He held unfurled his Freeman.\r\nCan\xe2\x80\x99t see now. Remember write Greek ees. Bloom dipped, Bloo mur: dear\r\nsir. Dear Henry wrote: dear Mady. Got your lett and flow. Hell did I\r\nput?

And look at the lovely shell\r\nshe brought.\r\n\r\nTo the end of the bar to him she bore lightly the spiked and winding\r\nseahorn that he, George Lidwell, solicitor, might hear.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Listen! she bade him.\r\n\r\nUnder Tom Kernan\xe2\x80\x99s ginhot words the accompanist wove music slow.\r\nAuthentic fact. How Walter Bapty lost his voice. Well, sir, the\r\nhusband took him by the throat. Scoundrel, said he, You\xe2\x80\x99ll sing no more\r\nlovesongs. He did, faith, sir Tom. Bob Cowley wove. Tenors get wom.\r\nCowley lay back.\r\n\r\nAh, now he heard, she holding it to his ear. Hear! He heard. Wonderful.\r\nShe held it to her own. And through the sifted light pale gold in\r\ncontrast glided. To hear.\r\n\r\nTap.\r\n\r\nBloom through the bardoor saw a shell held at their ears. He heard more\r\nfaintly that that they heard, each for herself alone, then each for\r\nother, hearing the plash of waves, loudly, a silent roar.\r\n\r\nBronze by a weary gold, anear, afar, they listened.\r\n\r\nHer ear too is a shell, the peeping lobe there. Been to the seaside.\r\nLovely seaside girls. Skin tanned raw. Should have put on coldcream\r\nfirst make it brown. Buttered toast. O and that lotion mustn\xe2\x80\x99t forget.\r\nFever near her mouth. Your head it simply. Hair braided over: shell with\r\nseaweed. Why do they hide their ears with seaweed hair? And Turks the\r\nmouth, why? Her eyes over the sheet. Yashmak. Find the way in. A cave.\r\nNo admittance except on business.\r\n\r\nThe sea they think they hear. Singing. A roar. The blood it is. Souse in\r\nthe ear sometimes. Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s a sea. Corpuscle islands.\r\n\r\nWonderful really. So distinct. Again. George Lidwell held its murmur,\r\nhearing: then laid it by, gently.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94What are the wild waves saying? he asked her, smiled.\r\n\r\nCharming, seasmiling and unanswering Lydia on Lidwell smiled.\r\n\r\nTap.\r\n\r\nBy Larry O\xe2\x80\x99Rourke\xe2\x80\x99s, by Larry, bold Larry O\xe2\x80\x99, Boylan swayed and Boylan\r\nturned.\r\n\r\nFrom the forsaken shell miss Mina glided to her tankards waiting.

She nobly\r\nanswered: with a gentleman friend.\r\n\r\nBob Cowley\xe2\x80\x99s twinkling fingers in the treble played again. The landlord\r\nhas the prior. A little time. Long John. Big Ben. Lightly he played a\r\nlight bright tinkling measure for tripping ladies, arch and smiling,\r\nand for their gallants, gentlemen friends. One: one, one, one, one, one:\r\ntwo, one, three, four.\r\n\r\nSea, wind, leaves, thunder, waters, cows lowing, the cattlemarket,\r\ncocks, hens don\xe2\x80\x99t crow, snakes hissss.

Court dresses of all descriptions in castle chambers\r\ndancing. Misery. Peasants outside. Green starving faces eating\r\ndockleaves. Nice that is. Look: look, look, look, look, look: you look\r\nat us.\r\n\r\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s joyful I can feel. Never have written it. Why? My joy is other\r\njoy. But both are joys. Yes, joy it must be. Mere fact of music shows\r\nyou are. Often thought she was in the dumps till she began to lilt. Then\r\nknow.\r\n\r\nM\xe2\x80\x99Coy valise. My wife and your wife. Squealing cat.

Could make a kind of pun on that.\r\nIt is a kind of music I often thought when she. Acoustics that is.\r\nTinkling. Empty vessels make most noise. Because the acoustics, the\r\nresonance changes according as the weight of the water is equal to\r\nthe law of falling water. Like those rhapsodies of Liszt\xe2\x80\x99s, Hungarian,\r\ngipsyeyed. Pearls. Drops. Rain. Diddleiddle addleaddle ooddleooddle.\r\nHissss. Now. Maybe now.

Our native Doric.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Ay do, Ben, Mr Dedalus said. Good men and true.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Do, do, they begged in one.\r\n\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll go. Here, Pat, return. Come. He came, he came, he did not stay. To\r\nme. How much?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94What key? Six sharps?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94F sharp major, Ben Dollard said.\r\n\r\nBob Cowley\xe2\x80\x99s outstretched talons griped the black deepsounding chords.\r\n\r\nMust go prince Bloom told Richie prince. No, Richie said. Yes, must. Got\r\nmoney somewhere. He\xe2\x80\x99s on for a razzle backache spree. Much? He seehears\r\nlipspeech. One and nine. Penny for yourself. Here. Give him twopence\r\ntip. Deaf, bothered. But perhaps he has wife and family waiting, waiting\r\nPatty come home. Hee hee hee hee. Deaf wait while they wait.\r\n\r\nBut wait. But hear. Chords dark. Lugugugubrious. Low. In a cave of the\r\ndark middle earth. Embedded ore. Lumpmusic.\r\n\r\nThe voice of dark age, of unlove, earth\xe2\x80\x99s fatigue made grave approach\r\nand painful, come from afar, from hoary mountains, called on good men\r\nand true. The priest he sought. With him would he speak a word.\r\n\r\nTap.\r\n\r\nBen Dollard\xe2\x80\x99s voice. Base barreltone. Doing his level best to say it.\r\nCroak of vast manless moonless womoonless marsh. Other comedown. Big\r\nships\xe2\x80\x99 chandler\xe2\x80\x99s business he did once. Remember: rosiny ropes, ships\xe2\x80\x99\r\nlanterns. Failed to the tune of ten thousand pounds. Now in the Iveagh\r\nhome. Cubicle number so and so. Number one Bass did that for him.\r\n\r\nThe priest\xe2\x80\x99s at home. A false priest\xe2\x80\x99s servant bade him welcome. Step\r\nin. The holy father. With bows a traitor servant. Curlycues of chords.\r\n\r\nRuin them. Wreck their lives. Then build them cubicles to end their days\r\nin. Hushaby. Lullaby. Die, dog. Little dog, die.\r\n\r\nThe voice of warning, solemn warning, told them the youth had entered\r\na lonely hall, told them how solemn fell his footsteps there, told them\r\nthe gloomy chamber, the vested priest sitting to shrive.\r\n\r\nDecent soul. Bit addled now. Thinks he\xe2\x80\x99ll win in Answers, poets\xe2\x80\x99 picture\r\npuzzle. We hand you crisp five pound note. Bird sitting hatching in a\r\nnest. Lay of the last minstrel he thought it was. See blank tee what\r\ndomestic animal? Tee dash ar most courageous mariner. Good voice he has\r\nstill. No eunuch yet with all his belongings.\r\n\r\nListen. Bloom listened. Richie Goulding listened. And by the door deaf\r\nPat, bald Pat, tipped Pat, listened.\r\n\r\nThe chords harped slower.\r\n\r\nThe voice of penance and of grief came slow, embellished, tremulous.\r\nBen\xe2\x80\x99s contrite beard confessed. in nomine Domini, in God\xe2\x80\x99s name he\r\nknelt. He beat his hand upon his breast, confessing: mea culpa.\r\n\r\nLatin again. That holds them like birdlime. Priest with the communion\r\ncorpus for those women. Chap in the mortuary, coffin or coffey,\r\ncorpusnomine. Wonder where that rat is by now. Scrape.\r\n\r\nTap.\r\n\r\nThey listened. Tankards and miss Kennedy. George Lidwell, eyelid well\r\nexpressive, fullbusted satin. Kernan. Si.\r\n\r\nThe sighing voice of sorrow sang. His sins. Since Easter he had cursed\r\nthree times. You bitch\xe2\x80\x99s bast. And once at masstime he had gone to play.\r\nOnce by the churchyard he had passed and for his mother\xe2\x80\x99s rest he had\r\nnot prayed. A boy. A croppy boy.\r\n\r\nBronze, listening, by the beerpull gazed far away. Soulfully. Doesn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nhalf know I\xe2\x80\x99m. Molly great dab at seeing anyone looking.\r\n\r\nBronze gazed far sideways. Mirror there. Is that best side of her face?\r\nThey always know. Knock at the door. Last tip to titivate.\r\n\r\nCockcarracarra.\r\n\r\nWhat do they think when they hear music? Way to catch rattlesnakes.\r\nNight Michael Gunn gave us the box. Tuning up. Shah of Persia liked\r\nthat best. Remind him of home sweet home. Wiped his nose in curtain too.\r\nCustom his country perhaps. That\xe2\x80\x99s music too. Not as bad as it sounds.\r\nTootling. Brasses braying asses through uptrunks. Doublebasses helpless,\r\ngashes in their sides. Woodwinds mooing cows. Semigrand open crocodile\r\nmusic hath jaws. Woodwind like Goodwin\xe2\x80\x99s name.\r\n\r\nShe looked fine. Her crocus dress she wore lowcut, belongings on show.\r\nClove her breath was always in theatre when she bent to ask a question.\r\nTold her what Spinoza says in that book of poor papa\xe2\x80\x99s. Hypnotised,\r\nlistening. Eyes like that. She bent. Chap in dresscircle staring down\r\ninto her with his operaglass for all he was worth. Beauty of music you\r\nmust hear twice. Nature woman half a look. God made the country man the\r\ntune. Met him pike hoses. Philosophy. O rocks!\r\n\r\nAll gone. All fallen. At the siege of Ross his father, at Gorey all his\r\nbrothers fell. To Wexford, we are the boys of Wexford, he would. Last of\r\nhis name and race.\r\n\r\nI too. Last of my race. Milly young student. Well, my fault perhaps. No\r\nson. Rudy. Too late now. Or if not? If not? If still?\r\n\r\nHe bore no hate.\r\n\r\nHate. Love. Those are names. Rudy. Soon I am old.\r\n\r\nBig Ben his voice unfolded. Great voice Richie Goulding said, a flush\r\nstruggling in his pale, to Bloom soon old. But when was young?\r\n\r\nIreland comes now. My country above the king. She listens. Who fears to\r\nspeak of nineteen four? Time to be shoving. Looked enough.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Bless me, father, Dollard the croppy cried. Bless me and let me go.\r\n\r\nTap.\r\n\r\nBloom looked, unblessed to go. Got up to kill: on eighteen bob a week.\r\nFellows shell out the dibs. Want to keep your weathereye open. Those\r\ngirls, those lovely. By the sad sea waves. Chorusgirl\xe2\x80\x99s romance. Letters\r\nread out for breach of promise. From Chickabiddy\xe2\x80\x99s owny Mumpsypum.\r\nLaughter in court. Henry. I never signed it. The lovely name you.\r\n\r\nLow sank the music, air and words. Then hastened. The false priest\r\nrustling soldier from his cassock. A yeoman captain. They know it all by\r\nheart. The thrill they itch for. Yeoman cap.\r\n\r\nTap. Tap.\r\n\r\nThrilled she listened, bending in sympathy to hear.\r\n\r\nBlank face. Virgin should say: or fingered only. Write something on it:\r\npage. If not what becomes of them? Decline, despair. Keeps them young.\r\nEven admire themselves. See. Play on her. Lip blow. Body of white woman,\r\na flute alive. Blow gentle. Loud. Three holes, all women. Goddess I\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t see. They want it. Not too much polite. That\xe2\x80\x99s why he gets them.\r\nGold in your pocket, brass in your face. Say something. Make her hear.\r\nWith look to look. Songs without words. Molly, that hurdygurdy boy.\r\nShe knew he meant the monkey was sick. Or because so like the Spanish.\r\nUnderstand animals too that way. Solomon did. Gift of nature.\r\n\r\nVentriloquise. My lips closed. Think in my stom. What?\r\n\r\nWill? You? I. Want. You. To.\r\n\r\nWith hoarse rude fury the yeoman cursed, swelling in apoplectic bitch\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbastard. A good thought, boy, to come. One hour\xe2\x80\x99s your time to live,\r\nyour last.\r\n\r\nTap. Tap.\r\n\r\nThrill now. Pity they feel. To wipe away a tear for martyrs that want\r\nto, dying to, die. For all things dying, for all things born. Poor Mrs\r\nPurefoy. Hope she\xe2\x80\x99s over. Because their wombs.\r\n\r\nA liquid of womb of woman eyeball gazed under a fence of lashes, calmly,\r\nhearing. See real beauty of the eye when she not speaks. On yonder\r\nriver. At each slow satiny heaving bosom\xe2\x80\x99s wave (her heaving embon) red\r\nrose rose slowly sank red rose. Heartbeats: her breath: breath that is\r\nlife. And all the tiny tiny fernfoils trembled of maidenhair.\r\n\r\nBut look. The bright stars fade. O rose! Castile. The morn. Ha. Lidwell.\r\nFor him then not for. Infatuated. I like that? See her from here though.\r\nPopped corks, splashes of beerfroth, stacks of empties.\r\n\r\nOn the smooth jutting beerpull laid Lydia hand, lightly, plumply, leave\r\nit to my hands. All lost in pity for croppy. Fro, to: to, fro: over\r\nthe polished knob (she knows his eyes, my eyes, her eyes) her thumb and\r\nfinger passed in pity: passed, reposed and, gently touching, then slid\r\nso smoothly, slowly down, a cool firm white enamel baton protruding\r\nthrough their sliding ring.\r\n\r\nWith a cock with a carra.\r\n\r\nTap. Tap. Tap.\r\n\r\nI hold this house. Amen. He gnashed in fury. Traitors swing.\r\n\r\nThe chords consented. Very sad thing. But had to be.\r\n\r\nGet out before the end. Thanks, that was heavenly. Where\xe2\x80\x99s my hat. Pass\r\nby her. Can leave that Freeman. Letter I have. Suppose she were the?\r\nNo. Walk, walk, walk. Like Cashel Boylo Connoro Coylo Tisdall Maurice\r\nTisntdall Farrell. Waaaaaaalk.\r\n\r\nWell, I must be. Are you off? Yrfmstbyes. Blmstup. O\xe2\x80\x99er ryehigh blue.\r\nOw. Bloom stood up. Soap feeling rather sticky behind. Must have\r\nsweated: music. That lotion, remember. Well, so long. High grade. Card\r\ninside. Yes.\r\n\r\nBy deaf Pat in the doorway straining ear Bloom passed.\r\n\r\nAt Geneva barrack that young man died. At Passage was his body laid.\r\nDolor! O, he dolores! The voice of the mournful chanter called to\r\ndolorous prayer.\r\n\r\nBy rose, by satiny bosom, by the fondling hand, by slops, by empties,\r\nby popped corks, greeting in going, past eyes and maidenhair, bronze and\r\nfaint gold in deepseashadow, went Bloom, soft Bloom, I feel so lonely\r\nBloom.\r\n\r\nTap. Tap. Tap.\r\n\r\nPray for him, prayed the bass of Dollard. You who hear in peace. Breathe\r\na prayer, drop a tear, good men, good people. He was the croppy boy.\r\n\r\nScaring eavesdropping boots croppy bootsboy Bloom in the Ormond hallway\r\nheard the growls and roars of bravo, fat backslapping, their boots all\r\ntreading, boots not the boots the boy. General chorus off for a swill to\r\nwash it down. Glad I avoided.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Come on, Ben, Simon Dedalus cried. By God, you\xe2\x80\x99re as good as ever you\r\nwere.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Better, said Tomgin Kernan. Most trenchant rendition of that ballad,\r\nupon my soul and honour it is.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Lablache, said Father Cowley.\r\n\r\nBen Dollard bulkily cachuchad towards the bar, mightily praisefed\r\nand all big roseate, on heavyfooted feet, his gouty fingers nakkering\r\ncastagnettes in the air.\r\n\r\nBig Benaben Dollard. Big Benben. Big Benben.\r\n\r\nRrr.\r\n\r\nAnd deepmoved all, Simon trumping compassion from foghorn nose, all\r\nlaughing they brought him forth, Ben Dollard, in right good cheer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94You\xe2\x80\x99re looking rubicund, George Lidwell said.\r\n\r\nMiss Douce composed her rose to wait.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Ben machree, said Mr Dedalus, clapping Ben\xe2\x80\x99s fat back shoulderblade.\r\nFit as a fiddle only he has a lot of adipose tissue concealed about his\r\nperson.\r\n\r\nRrrrrrrsss.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Fat of death, Simon, Ben Dollard growled.\r\n\r\nRichie rift in the lute alone sat: Goulding, Collis, Ward. Uncertainly\r\nhe waited. Unpaid Pat too.\r\n\r\nTap. Tap. Tap. Tap.\r\n\r\nMiss Mina Kennedy brought near her lips to ear of tankard one.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Mr Dollard, they murmured low.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Dollard, murmured tankard.\r\n\r\nTank one believed: miss Kenn when she: that doll he was: she doll: the\r\ntank.\r\n\r\nHe murmured that he knew the name. The name was familiar to him, that\r\nis to say. That was to say he had heard the name of. Dollard, was it?\r\nDollard, yes.\r\n\r\nYes, her lips said more loudly, Mr Dollard. He sang that song lovely,\r\nmurmured Mina. Mr Dollard. And The last rose of summer was a lovely\r\nsong. Mina loved that song. Tankard loved the song that Mina.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Tis the last rose of summer dollard left bloom felt wind wound round\r\ninside.\r\n\r\nGassy thing that cider: binding too. Wait. Postoffice near Reuben J\xe2\x80\x99s\r\none and eightpence too. Get shut of it. Dodge round by Greek street.\r\nWish I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t promised to meet. Freer in air. Music. Gets on your\r\nnerves. Beerpull. Her hand that rocks the cradle rules the. Ben Howth.\r\nThat rules the world.\r\n\r\nFar. Far. Far. Far.\r\n\r\nTap. Tap. Tap.

Better give way\r\nonly half way the way of a man with a maid. Instance enthusiasts. All\r\nears. Not lose a demisemiquaver. Eyes shut. Head nodding in time. Dotty.\r\nYou daren\xe2\x80\x99t budge. Thinking strictly prohibited. Always talking shop.\r\nFiddlefaddle about notes.\r\n\r\nAll a kind of attempt to talk. Unpleasant when it stops because you\r\nnever know exac. Organ in Gardiner street. Old Glynn fifty quid a year.\r\nQueer up there in the cockloft, alone, with stops and locks and keys.\r\nSeated all day at the organ. Maunder on for hours, talking to himself or\r\nthe other fellow blowing the bellows. Growl angry, then shriek cursing\r\n(want to have wadding or something in his no don\xe2\x80\x99t she cried), then all\r\nof a soft sudden wee little wee little pipy wind.\r\n\r\nPwee! A wee little wind piped eeee. In Bloom\xe2\x80\x99s little wee.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Was he? Mr Dedalus said, returning with fetched pipe. I was with him\r\nthis morning at poor little Paddy Dignam\xe2\x80\x99s...\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Ay, the Lord have mercy on him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94By the bye there\xe2\x80\x99s a tuningfork in there on the...\r\n\r\nTap.

Lidwell asked.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94O, that must be the tuner, Lydia said to Simonlionel first I saw,\r\nforgot it when he was here.\r\n\r\nBlind he was she told George Lidwell second I saw. And played so\r\nexquisitely, treat to hear. Exquisite contrast: bronzelid, minagold.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Shout! Ben Dollard shouted, pouring. Sing out!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98lldo! cried Father Cowley.\r\n\r\nRrrrrr.\r\n\r\nI feel I want...\r\n\r\nTap. Tap. Tap. Tap. Tap\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Very, Mr Dedalus said, staring hard at a headless sardine.\r\n\r\nUnder the sandwichbell lay on a bier of bread one last, one lonely, last\r\nsardine of summer. Bloom alone.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Very, he stared. The lower register, for choice.\r\n\r\nTap. Tap. Tap. Tap. Tap. Tap. Tap. Tap.\r\n\r\nBloom went by Barry\xe2\x80\x99s. Wish I could. Wait. That wonderworker if I had.\r\nTwentyfour solicitors in that one house. Counted them. Litigation. Love\r\none another. Piles of parchment. Messrs Pick and Pocket have power of\r\nattorney. Goulding, Collis, Ward.\r\n\r\nBut for example the chap that wallops the big drum. His vocation: Mickey\r\nRooney\xe2\x80\x99s band. Wonder how it first struck him. Sitting at home after\r\npig\xe2\x80\x99s cheek and cabbage nursing it in the armchair. Rehearsing his band\r\npart. Pom. Pompedy. Jolly for the wife. Asses\xe2\x80\x99 skins. Welt them through\r\nlife, then wallop after death. Pom. Wallop. Seems to be what you call\r\nyashmak or I mean kismet. Fate.\r\n\r\nTap. Tap. A stripling, blind, with a tapping cane came taptaptapping by\r\nDaly\xe2\x80\x99s window where a mermaid hair all streaming (but he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t see)\r\nblew whiffs of a mermaid (blind couldn\xe2\x80\x99t), mermaid, coolest whiff of\r\nall.\r\n\r\nInstruments. A blade of grass, shell of her hands, then blow. Even\r\ncomb and tissuepaper you can knock a tune out of. Molly in her shift in\r\nLombard street west, hair down. I suppose each kind of trade made its\r\nown, don\xe2\x80\x99t you see? Hunter with a horn. Haw. Have you the? Cloche.\r\nSonnez la. Shepherd his pipe. Pwee little wee.

O,\r\nthe whore of the lane!\r\n\r\nA frowsy whore with black straw sailor hat askew came glazily in the day\r\nalong the quay towards Mr Bloom. When first he saw that form endearing?\r\nYes, it is.

P. at the\r\ncorner of Arbour hill there and be damned but a bloody sweep came along\r\nand he near drove his gear into my eye. I turned around to let him have\r\nthe weight of my tongue when who should I see dodging along Stony Batter\r\nonly Joe Hynes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Lo, Joe, says I. How are you blowing? Did you see that bloody\r\nchimneysweep near shove my eye out with his brush?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Soot\xe2\x80\x99s luck, says Joe. Who\xe2\x80\x99s the old ballocks you were talking to?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Old Troy, says I, was in the force. I\xe2\x80\x99m on two minds not to give that\r\nfellow in charge for obstructing the thoroughfare with his brooms and\r\nladders.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94What are you doing round those parts? says Joe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Devil a much, says I. There\xe2\x80\x99s a bloody big foxy thief beyond by the\r\ngarrison church at the corner of Chicken lane\xe2\x80\x94old Troy was just giving\r\nme a wrinkle about him\xe2\x80\x94lifted any God\xe2\x80\x99s quantity of tea and sugar to\r\npay three bob a week said he had a farm in the county Down off a\r\nhop-of-my-thumb by the name of Moses Herzog over there near Heytesbury\r\nstreet.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Circumcised? says Joe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Ay, says I. A bit off the top. An old plumber named Geraghty. I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nhanging on to his taw now for the past fortnight and I can\xe2\x80\x99t get a penny\r\nout of him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94That the lay you\xe2\x80\x99re on now? says Joe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Ay, says I. How are the mighty fallen! Collector of bad and doubtful\r\ndebts. But that\xe2\x80\x99s the most notorious bloody robber you\xe2\x80\x99d meet in a day\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwalk and the face on him all pockmarks would hold a shower of rain.\r\nTell him, says he, I dare him, says he, and I doubledare him to send\r\nyou round here again or if he does, says he, I\xe2\x80\x99ll have him summonsed up\r\nbefore the court, so I will, for trading without a licence. And he after\r\nstuffing himself till he\xe2\x80\x99s fit to burst. Jesus, I had to laugh at the\r\nlittle jewy getting his shirt out. He drink me my teas. He eat me my\r\nsugars. Because he no pay me my moneys?\r\n\r\nFor nonperishable goods bought of Moses Herzog, of 13 Saint Kevin\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nparade in the city of Dublin, Wood quay ward, merchant, hereinafter\r\ncalled the vendor, and sold and delivered to Michael E. Geraghty,\r\nesquire, of 29 Arbour hill in the city of Dublin, Arran quay ward,\r\ngentleman, hereinafter called the purchaser, videlicet, five pounds\r\navoirdupois of first choice tea at three shillings and no pence per\r\npound avoirdupois and three stone avoirdupois of sugar, crushed crystal,\r\nat threepence per pound avoirdupois, the said purchaser debtor to the\r\nsaid vendor of one pound five shillings and sixpence sterling for value\r\nreceived which amount shall be paid by said purchaser to said vendor in\r\nweekly instalments every seven calendar days of three shillings and no\r\npence sterling: and the said nonperishable goods shall not be pawned or\r\npledged or sold or otherwise alienated by the said purchaser but shall\r\nbe and remain and be held to be the sole and exclusive property of the\r\nsaid vendor to be disposed of at his good will and pleasure until the\r\nsaid amount shall have been duly paid by the said purchaser to the said\r\nvendor in the manner herein set forth as this day hereby agreed between\r\nthe said vendor, his heirs, successors, trustees and assigns of the one\r\npart and the said purchaser, his heirs, successors, trustees and assigns\r\nof the other part.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Are you a strict t.t.? says Joe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Not taking anything between drinks, says I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94What about paying our respects to our friend? says Joe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Who? says I. Sure, he\xe2\x80\x99s out in John of God\xe2\x80\x99s off his head, poor man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Drinking his own stuff? says Joe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Ay, says I. Whisky and water on the brain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Come around to Barney Kiernan\xe2\x80\x99s, says Joe. I want to see the citizen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Barney mavourneen\xe2\x80\x99s be it, says I. Anything strange or wonderful, Joe?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Not a word, says Joe. I was up at that meeting in the City Arms.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94-What was that, Joe? says I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Cattle traders, says Joe, about the foot and mouth disease. I want to\r\ngive the citizen the hard word about it.\r\n\r\nSo we went around by the Linenhall barracks and the back of the\r\ncourthouse talking of one thing or another. Decent fellow Joe when he\r\nhas it but sure like that he never has it. Jesus, I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get over\r\nthat bloody foxy Geraghty, the daylight robber. For trading without a\r\nlicence, says he.\r\n\r\nIn Inisfail the fair there lies a land, the land of holy Michan. There\r\nrises a watchtower beheld of men afar. There sleep the mighty dead as in\r\nlife they slept, warriors and princes of high renown. A pleasant land\r\nit is in sooth of murmuring waters, fishful streams where sport the\r\ngurnard, the plaice, the roach, the halibut, the gibbed haddock, the\r\ngrilse, the dab, the brill, the flounder, the pollock, the mixed coarse\r\nfish generally and other denizens of the aqueous kingdom too numerous to\r\nbe enumerated. In the mild breezes of the west and of the east the lofty\r\ntrees wave in different directions their firstclass foliage, the wafty\r\nsycamore, the Lebanonian cedar, the exalted planetree, the eugenic\r\neucalyptus and other ornaments of the arboreal world with which\r\nthat region is thoroughly well supplied. Lovely maidens sit in close\r\nproximity to the roots of the lovely trees singing the most lovely songs\r\nwhile they play with all kinds of lovely objects as for example golden\r\ningots, silvery fishes, crans of herrings, drafts of eels, codlings,\r\ncreels of fingerlings, purple seagems and playful insects. And heroes\r\nvoyage from afar to woo them, from Eblana to Slievemargy, the peerless\r\nprinces of unfettered Munster and of Connacht the just and of smooth\r\nsleek Leinster and of Cruachan\xe2\x80\x99s land and of Armagh the splendid and of\r\nthe noble district of Boyle, princes, the sons of kings.\r\n\r\nAnd there rises a shining palace whose crystal glittering roof is seen\r\nby mariners who traverse the extensive sea in barks built expressly for\r\nthat purpose, and thither come all herds and fatlings and firstfruits\r\nof that land for O\xe2\x80\x99Connell Fitzsimon takes toll of them, a chieftain\r\ndescended from chieftains. Thither the extremely large wains bring\r\nfoison of the fields, flaskets of cauliflowers, floats of spinach,\r\npineapple chunks, Rangoon beans, strikes of tomatoes, drums of figs,\r\ndrills of Swedes, spherical potatoes and tallies of iridescent kale,\r\nYork and Savoy, and trays of onions, pearls of the earth, and punnets of\r\nmushrooms and custard marrows and fat vetches and bere and rape and red\r\ngreen yellow brown russet sweet big bitter ripe pomellated apples and\r\nchips of strawberries and sieves of gooseberries, pulpy and pelurious,\r\nand strawberries fit for princes and raspberries from their canes.\r\n\r\nI dare him, says he, and I doubledare him. Come out here, Geraghty, you\r\nnotorious bloody hill and dale robber!\r\n\r\nAnd by that way wend the herds innumerable of bellwethers and flushed\r\newes and shearling rams and lambs and stubble geese and medium steers\r\nand roaring mares and polled calves and longwools and storesheep and\r\nCuffe\xe2\x80\x99s prime springers and culls and sowpigs and baconhogs and the\r\nvarious different varieties of highly distinguished swine and Angus\r\nheifers and polly bulllocks of immaculate pedigree together with prime\r\npremiated milchcows and beeves: and there is ever heard a trampling,\r\ncackling, roaring, lowing, bleating, bellowing, rumbling, grunting,\r\nchamping, chewing, of sheep and pigs and heavyhooved kine from\r\npasturelands of Lusk and Rush and Carrickmines and from the streamy\r\nvales of Thomond, from the M\xe2\x80\x99Gillicuddy\xe2\x80\x99s reeks the inaccessible and\r\nlordly Shannon the unfathomable, and from the gentle declivities of the\r\nplace of the race of Kiar, their udders distended with superabundance of\r\nmilk and butts of butter and rennets of cheese and farmer\xe2\x80\x99s firkins and\r\ntargets of lamb and crannocks of corn and oblong eggs in great hundreds,\r\nvarious in size, the agate with this dun.\r\n\r\nSo we turned into Barney Kiernan\xe2\x80\x99s and there, sure enough, was the\r\ncitizen up in the corner having a great confab with himself and that\r\nbloody mangy mongrel, Garryowen, and he waiting for what the sky would\r\ndrop in the way of drink.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94There he is, says I, in his gloryhole, with his cruiskeen lawn and his\r\nload of papers, working for the cause.\r\n\r\nThe bloody mongrel let a grouse out of him would give you the creeps. Be\r\na corporal work of mercy if someone would take the life of that bloody\r\ndog. I\xe2\x80\x99m told for a fact he ate a good part of the breeches off a\r\nconstabulary man in Santry that came round one time with a blue paper\r\nabout a licence.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Stand and deliver, says he.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94That\xe2\x80\x99s all right, citizen, says Joe. Friends here.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Pass, friends, says he.\r\n\r\nThen he rubs his hand in his eye and says he:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94What\xe2\x80\x99s your opinion of the times?\r\n\r\nDoing the rapparee and Rory of the hill. But, begob, Joe was equal to\r\nthe occasion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I think the markets are on a rise, says he, sliding his hand down his\r\nfork.\r\n\r\nSo begob the citizen claps his paw on his knee and he says:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Foreign wars is the cause of it.\r\n\r\nAnd says Joe, sticking his thumb in his pocket:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94It\xe2\x80\x99s the Russians wish to tyrannise.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Arrah, give over your bloody codding, Joe, says I. I\xe2\x80\x99ve a thirst on me\r\nI wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t sell for half a crown.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Give it a name, citizen, says Joe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Wine of the country, says he.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94What\xe2\x80\x99s yours? says Joe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Ditto MacAnaspey, says I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Three pints, Terry, says Joe. And how\xe2\x80\x99s the old heart, citizen? says\r\nhe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Never better, a chara, says he. What Garry? Are we going to win? Eh?\r\n\r\nAnd with that he took the bloody old towser by the scruff of the neck\r\nand, by Jesus, he near throttled him.\r\n\r\nThe figure seated on a large boulder at the foot of a round tower was\r\nthat of a broadshouldered deepchested stronglimbed frankeyed redhaired\r\nfreelyfreckled shaggybearded widemouthed largenosed longheaded\r\ndeepvoiced barekneed brawnyhanded hairylegged ruddyfaced sinewyarmed\r\nhero. From shoulder to shoulder he measured several ells and his\r\nrocklike mountainous knees were covered, as was likewise the rest of his\r\nbody wherever visible, with a strong growth of tawny prickly hair in\r\nhue and toughness similar to the mountain gorse (Ulex Europeus).\r\nThe widewinged nostrils, from which bristles of the same tawny hue\r\nprojected, were of such capaciousness that within their cavernous\r\nobscurity the fieldlark might easily have lodged her nest. The eyes\r\nin which a tear and a smile strove ever for the mastery were of the\r\ndimensions of a goodsized cauliflower. A powerful current of warm breath\r\nissued at regular intervals from the profound cavity of his mouth\r\nwhile in rhythmic resonance the loud strong hale reverberations of his\r\nformidable heart thundered rumblingly causing the ground, the summit of\r\nthe lofty tower and the still loftier walls of the cave to vibrate and\r\ntremble.\r\n\r\nHe wore a long unsleeved garment of recently flayed oxhide reaching\r\nto the knees in a loose kilt and this was bound about his middle by\r\na girdle of plaited straw and rushes. Beneath this he wore trews of\r\ndeerskin, roughly stitched with gut. His nether extremities were encased\r\nin high Balbriggan buskins dyed in lichen purple, the feet being shod\r\nwith brogues of salted cowhide laced with the windpipe of the same\r\nbeast. From his girdle hung a row of seastones which jangled at every\r\nmovement of his portentous frame and on these were graven with rude\r\nyet striking art the tribal images of many Irish heroes and heroines of\r\nantiquity, Cuchulin, Conn of hundred battles, Niall of nine hostages,\r\nBrian of Kincora, the ardri Malachi, Art MacMurragh, Shane O\xe2\x80\x99Neill,\r\nFather John Murphy, Owen Roe, Patrick Sarsfield, Red Hugh O\xe2\x80\x99Donnell,\r\nRed Jim MacDermott, Soggarth Eoghan O\xe2\x80\x99Growney, Michael Dwyer, Francy\r\nHiggins, Henry Joy M\xe2\x80\x99Cracken, Goliath, Horace Wheatley, Thomas Conneff,\r\nPeg Woffington, the Village Blacksmith, Captain Moonlight, Captain\r\nBoycott, Dante Alighieri, Christopher Columbus, S. Fursa, S. Brendan,\r\nMarshal MacMahon, Charlemagne, Theobald Wolfe Tone, the Mother of the\r\nMaccabees, the Last of the Mohicans, the Rose of Castile, the Man for\r\nGalway, The Man that Broke the Bank at Monte Carlo, The Man in the Gap,\r\nThe Woman Who Didn\xe2\x80\x99t, Benjamin Franklin, Napoleon Bonaparte, John L.\r\nSullivan, Cleopatra, Savourneen Deelish, Julius Caesar, Paracelsus, sir\r\nThomas Lipton, William Tell, Michelangelo Hayes, Muhammad, the Bride of\r\nLammermoor, Peter the Hermit, Peter the Packer, Dark Rosaleen, Patrick\r\nW.

A couched spear of\r\nacuminated granite rested by him while at his feet reposed a savage\r\nanimal of the canine tribe whose stertorous gasps announced that he was\r\nsunk in uneasy slumber, a supposition confirmed by hoarse growls and\r\nspasmodic movements which his master repressed from time to time\r\nby tranquilising blows of a mighty cudgel rudely fashioned out of\r\npaleolithic stone.\r\n\r\nSo anyhow Terry brought the three pints Joe was standing and begob the\r\nsight nearly left my eyes when I saw him land out a quid. O, as true as\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m telling you. A goodlooking sovereign.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94And there\xe2\x80\x99s more where that came from, says he.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Were you robbing the poorbox, Joe? says I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Sweat of my brow, says Joe. \xe2\x80\x98Twas the prudent member gave me the\r\nwheeze.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I saw him before I met you, says I, sloping around by Pill lane and\r\nGreek street with his cod\xe2\x80\x99s eye counting up all the guts of the fish.\r\n\r\nWho comes through Michan\xe2\x80\x99s land, bedight in sable armour? O\xe2\x80\x99Bloom,\r\nthe son of Rory: it is he. Impervious to fear is Rory\xe2\x80\x99s son: he of the\r\nprudent soul.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94For the old woman of Prince\xe2\x80\x99s street, says the citizen, the subsidised\r\norgan. The pledgebound party on the floor of the house. And look at this\r\nblasted rag, says he. Look at this, says he. The Irish Independent, if\r\nyou please, founded by Parnell to be the workingman\xe2\x80\x99s friend. Listen to\r\nthe births and deaths in the Irish all for Ireland Independent, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nthank you and the marriages.\r\n\r\nAnd he starts reading them out:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Gordon, Barnfield crescent, Exeter; Redmayne of Iffley, Saint Anne\xe2\x80\x99s on\r\nSea: the wife of William T Redmayne of a son. How\xe2\x80\x99s that, eh? Wright and\r\nFlint, Vincent and Gillett to Rotha Marion daughter of Rosa and the\r\nlate George Alfred Gillett, 179 Clapham road, Stockwell, Playwood and\r\nRidsdale at Saint Jude\xe2\x80\x99s, Kensington by the very reverend Dr Forrest,\r\ndean of Worcester. Eh? Deaths. Bristow, at Whitehall lane, London: Carr,\r\nStoke Newington, of gastritis and heart disease: Cockburn, at the Moat\r\nhouse, Chepstow...\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I know that fellow, says Joe, from bitter experience.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Cockburn. Dimsey, wife of David Dimsey, late of the admiralty: Miller,\r\nTottenham, aged eightyfive: Welsh, June 12, at 35 Canning street,\r\nLiverpool, Isabella Helen. How\xe2\x80\x99s that for a national press, eh, my brown\r\nson! How\xe2\x80\x99s that for Martin Murphy, the Bantry jobber?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Ah, well, says Joe, handing round the boose. Thanks be to God they had\r\nthe start of us. Drink that, citizen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I will, says he, honourable person.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Health, Joe, says I. And all down the form.\r\n\r\nAh! Ow! Don\xe2\x80\x99t be talking! I was blue mouldy for the want of that pint.\r\nDeclare to God I could hear it hit the pit of my stomach with a click.\r\n\r\nAnd lo, as they quaffed their cup of joy, a godlike messenger came\r\nswiftly in, radiant as the eye of heaven, a comely youth and behind him\r\nthere passed an elder of noble gait and countenance, bearing the sacred\r\nscrolls of law and with him his lady wife a dame of peerless lineage,\r\nfairest of her race.\r\n\r\nLittle Alf Bergan popped in round the door and hid behind Barney\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsnug, squeezed up with the laughing. And who was sitting up there in\r\nthe corner that I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t seen snoring drunk blind to the world only Bob\r\nDoran. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know what was up and Alf kept making signs out of the\r\ndoor. And begob what was it only that bloody old pantaloon Denis Breen\r\nin his bathslippers with two bloody big books tucked under his oxter and\r\nthe wife hotfoot after him, unfortunate wretched woman, trotting like a\r\npoodle. I thought Alf would split.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Look at him, says he. Breen. He\xe2\x80\x99s traipsing all round Dublin with a\r\npostcard someone sent him with U.P.: up on it to take a li...\r\n\r\nAnd he doubled up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Take a what? says I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Libel action, says he, for ten thousand pounds.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94O hell! says I.\r\n\r\nThe bloody mongrel began to growl that\xe2\x80\x99d put the fear of God in you\r\nseeing something was up but the citizen gave him a kick in the ribs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Bi i dho husht, says he.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Who? says Joe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Breen, says Alf. He was in John Henry Menton\xe2\x80\x99s and then he went round\r\nto Collis and Ward\xe2\x80\x99s and then Tom Rochford met him and sent him round to\r\nthe subsheriff\xe2\x80\x99s for a lark. O God, I\xe2\x80\x99ve a pain laughing. U. p: up. The\r\nlong fellow gave him an eye as good as a process and now the bloody old\r\nlunatic is gone round to Green street to look for a G man.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94When is long John going to hang that fellow in Mountjoy? says Joe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Bergan, says Bob Doran, waking up. Is that Alf Bergan?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Yes, says Alf. Hanging? Wait till I show you. Here, Terry, give us a\r\npony. That bloody old fool! Ten thousand pounds. You should have seen\r\nlong John\xe2\x80\x99s eye. U.P....\r\n\r\nAnd he started laughing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Who are you laughing at? says Bob Doran. Is that Bergan?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Hurry up, Terry boy, says Alf.\r\n\r\nTerence O\xe2\x80\x99Ryan heard him and straightway brought him a crystal cup\r\nfull of the foamy ebon ale which the noble twin brothers Bungiveagh and\r\nBungardilaun brew ever in their divine alevats, cunning as the sons of\r\ndeathless Leda. For they garner the succulent berries of the hop and\r\nmass and sift and bruise and brew them and they mix therewith sour\r\njuices and bring the must to the sacred fire and cease not night or day\r\nfrom their toil, those cunning brothers, lords of the vat.\r\n\r\nThen did you, chivalrous Terence, hand forth, as to the manner born,\r\nthat nectarous beverage and you offered the crystal cup to him that\r\nthirsted, the soul of chivalry, in beauty akin to the immortals.\r\n\r\nBut he, the young chief of the O\xe2\x80\x99Bergan\xe2\x80\x99s, could ill brook to be outdone\r\nin generous deeds but gave therefor with gracious gesture a testoon of\r\ncostliest bronze. Thereon embossed in excellent smithwork was seen\r\nthe image of a queen of regal port, scion of the house of Brunswick,\r\nVictoria her name, Her Most Excellent Majesty, by grace of God of the\r\nUnited Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and of the British dominions\r\nbeyond the sea, queen, defender of the faith, Empress of India, even\r\nshe, who bore rule, a victress over many peoples, the wellbeloved, for\r\nthey knew and loved her from the rising of the sun to the going down\r\nthereof, the pale, the dark, the ruddy and the ethiop.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94What\xe2\x80\x99s that bloody freemason doing, says the citizen, prowling up and\r\ndown outside?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94What\xe2\x80\x99s that? says Joe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Here you are, says Alf, chucking out the rhino. Talking about hanging,\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll show you something you never saw. Hangmen\xe2\x80\x99s letters. Look at here.\r\n\r\nSo he took a bundle of wisps of letters and envelopes out of his pocket.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Are you codding? says I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Honest injun, says Alf. Read them.\r\n\r\nSo Joe took up the letters.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Who are you laughing at? says Bob Doran.\r\n\r\nSo I saw there was going to be a bit of a dust. Bob\xe2\x80\x99s a queer chap when\r\nthe porter\xe2\x80\x99s up in him so says I just to make talk:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94How\xe2\x80\x99s Willy Murray those times, Alf?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, says Alf. I saw him just now in Capel street with Paddy\r\nDignam. Only I was running after that...\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94You what? says Joe, throwing down the letters. With who?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94With Dignam, says Alf.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Is it Paddy? says Joe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Yes, says Alf. Why?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Don\xe2\x80\x99t you know he\xe2\x80\x99s dead? says Joe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Paddy Dignam dead! says Alf.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Ay, says Joe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Sure I\xe2\x80\x99m after seeing him not five minutes ago, says Alf, as plain as a\r\npikestaff.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Who\xe2\x80\x99s dead? says Bob Doran.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94You saw his ghost then, says Joe, God between us and harm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94What? says Alf. Good Christ, only five... What?... And Willy Murray\r\nwith him, the two of them there near whatdoyoucallhim\xe2\x80\x99s... What? Dignam\r\ndead?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94What about Dignam? says Bob Doran. Who\xe2\x80\x99s talking about...?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Dead! says Alf. He\xe2\x80\x99s no more dead than you are.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Maybe so, says Joe. They took the liberty of burying him this morning\r\nanyhow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Paddy? says Alf.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Ay, says Joe. He paid the debt of nature, God be merciful to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Good Christ! says Alf.\r\n\r\nBegob he was what you might call flabbergasted.\r\n\r\nIn the darkness spirit hands were felt to flutter and when prayer by\r\ntantras had been directed to the proper quarter a faint but increasing\r\nluminosity of ruby light became gradually visible, the apparition of\r\nthe etheric double being particularly lifelike owing to the discharge\r\nof jivic rays from the crown of the head and face. Communication was\r\neffected through the pituitary body and also by means of the orangefiery\r\nand scarlet rays emanating from the sacral region and solar plexus.\r\nQuestioned by his earthname as to his whereabouts in the heavenworld he\r\nstated that he was now on the path of pralaya or return but was still\r\nsubmitted to trial at the hands of certain bloodthirsty entities on the\r\nlower astral levels. In reply to a question as to his first sensations\r\nin the great divide beyond he stated that previously he had seen as in a\r\nglass darkly but that those who had passed over had summit possibilities\r\nof atmic development opened up to them. Interrogated as to whether life\r\nthere resembled our experience in the flesh he stated that he had heard\r\nfrom more favoured beings now in the spirit that their abodes were\r\nequipped with every modern home comfort such as talafana, alavatar,\r\nhatakalda, wataklasat and that the highest adepts were steeped in\r\nwaves of volupcy of the very purest nature. Having requested a quart of\r\nbuttermilk this was brought and evidently afforded relief. Asked if he\r\nhad any message for the living he exhorted all who were still at the\r\nwrong side of Maya to acknowledge the true path for it was reported\r\nin devanic circles that Mars and Jupiter were out for mischief on the\r\neastern angle where the ram has power. It was then queried whether there\r\nwere any special desires on the part of the defunct and the reply was:\r\nWe greet you, friends of earth, who are still in the body. Mind C. K.\r\ndoesn\xe2\x80\x99t pile it on. It was ascertained that the reference was to Mr\r\nCornelius Kelleher, manager of Messrs H. J. O\xe2\x80\x99Neill\xe2\x80\x99s popular\r\nfuneral establishment, a personal friend of the defunct, who had been\r\nresponsible for the carrying out of the interment arrangements. Before\r\ndeparting he requested that it should be told to his dear son Patsy that\r\nthe other boot which he had been looking for was at present under the\r\ncommode in the return room and that the pair should be sent to Cullen\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nto be soled only as the heels were still good. He stated that this had\r\ngreatly perturbed his peace of mind in the other region and earnestly\r\nrequested that his desire should be made known.\r\n\r\nAssurances were given that the matter would be attended to and it was\r\nintimated that this had given satisfaction.\r\n\r\nHe is gone from mortal haunts: O\xe2\x80\x99Dignam, sun of our morning. Fleet was\r\nhis foot on the bracken: Patrick of the beamy brow. Wail, Banba, with\r\nyour wind: and wail, O ocean, with your whirlwind.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94There he is again, says the citizen, staring out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Who? says I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Bloom, says he. He\xe2\x80\x99s on point duty up and down there for the last ten\r\nminutes.\r\n\r\nAnd, begob, I saw his physog do a peep in and then slidder off again.\r\n\r\nLittle Alf was knocked bawways. Faith, he was.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Good Christ! says he. I could have sworn it was him.\r\n\r\nAnd says Bob Doran, with the hat on the back of his poll, lowest\r\nblackguard in Dublin when he\xe2\x80\x99s under the influence:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Who said Christ is good?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I beg your parsnips, says Alf.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Is that a good Christ, says Bob Doran, to take away poor little Willy\r\nDignam?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Ah, well, says Alf, trying to pass it off. He\xe2\x80\x99s over all his troubles.\r\n\r\nBut Bob Doran shouts out of him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94He\xe2\x80\x99s a bloody ruffian, I say, to take away poor little Willy Dignam.\r\n\r\nTerry came down and tipped him the wink to keep quiet, that they didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nwant that kind of talk in a respectable licensed premises. And Bob Doran\r\nstarts doing the weeps about Paddy Dignam, true as you\xe2\x80\x99re there.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94The finest man, says he, snivelling, the finest purest character.\r\n\r\nThe tear is bloody near your eye. Talking through his bloody hat. Fitter\r\nfor him go home to the little sleepwalking bitch he married, Mooney, the\r\nbumbailiff\xe2\x80\x99s daughter, mother kept a kip in Hardwicke street, that\r\nused to be stravaging about the landings Bantam Lyons told me that was\r\nstopping there at two in the morning without a stitch on her, exposing\r\nher person, open to all comers, fair field and no favour.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94The noblest, the truest, says he. And he\xe2\x80\x99s gone, poor little Willy,\r\npoor little Paddy Dignam.\r\n\r\nAnd mournful and with a heavy heart he bewept the extinction of that\r\nbeam of heaven.\r\n\r\nOld Garryowen started growling again at Bloom that was skeezing round\r\nthe door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Come in, come on, he won\xe2\x80\x99t eat you, says the citizen.\r\n\r\nSo Bloom slopes in with his cod\xe2\x80\x99s eye on the dog and he asks Terry was\r\nMartin Cunningham there.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94O, Christ M\xe2\x80\x99Keown, says Joe, reading one of the letters. Listen to\r\nthis, will you?\r\n\r\nAnd he starts reading out one.\r\n\r\n      7 Hunter Street,\r\n      Liverpool.\r\n      To the High Sheriff of Dublin,\r\n      Dublin.\r\n\r\nHonoured sir i beg to offer my services in the abovementioned painful\r\ncase i hanged Joe Gann in Bootle jail on the 12 of Febuary 1900 and i\r\nhanged...\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Show us, Joe, says I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94... private Arthur Chace for fowl murder of Jessie Tilsit in\r\nPentonville prison and i was assistant when...\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Jesus, says I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94... Billington executed the awful murderer Toad Smith...\r\n\r\nThe citizen made a grab at the letter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Hold hard, says Joe, i have a special nack of putting the noose once in\r\nhe can\xe2\x80\x99t get out hoping to be favoured i remain, honoured sir, my terms\r\nis five ginnees.\r\n\r\n      H. Rumbold,\r\n      Master Barber.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94And a barbarous bloody barbarian he is too, says the citizen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94And the dirty scrawl of the wretch, says Joe. Here, says he, take them\r\nto hell out of my sight, Alf. Hello, Bloom, says he, what will you have?\r\n\r\nSo they started arguing about the point, Bloom saying he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t and he\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t and excuse him no offence and all to that and then he said well\r\nhe\xe2\x80\x99d just take a cigar. Gob, he\xe2\x80\x99s a prudent member and no mistake.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Give us one of your prime stinkers, Terry, says Joe.\r\n\r\nAnd Alf was telling us there was one chap sent in a mourning card with a\r\nblack border round it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94They\xe2\x80\x99re all barbers, says he, from the black country that would hang\r\ntheir own fathers for five quid down and travelling expenses.\r\n\r\nAnd he was telling us there\xe2\x80\x99s two fellows waiting below to pull his\r\nheels down when he gets the drop and choke him properly and then they\r\nchop up the rope after and sell the bits for a few bob a skull.\r\n\r\nIn the dark land they bide, the vengeful knights of the razor. Their\r\ndeadly coil they grasp: yea, and therein they lead to Erebus whatsoever\r\nwight hath done a deed of blood for I will on nowise suffer it even so\r\nsaith the Lord.\r\n\r\nSo they started talking about capital punishment and of course Bloom\r\ncomes out with the why and the wherefore and all the codology of the\r\nbusiness and the old dog smelling him all the time I\xe2\x80\x99m told those jewies\r\ndoes have a sort of a queer odour coming off them for dogs about I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nknow what all deterrent effect and so forth and so on.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94There\xe2\x80\x99s one thing it hasn\xe2\x80\x99t a deterrent effect on, says Alf.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94What\xe2\x80\x99s that? says Joe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94The poor bugger\xe2\x80\x99s tool that\xe2\x80\x99s being hanged, says Alf.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94That so? says Joe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94God\xe2\x80\x99s truth, says Alf. I heard that from the head warder that was in\r\nKilmainham when they hanged Joe Brady, the invincible. He told me when\r\nthey cut him down after the drop it was standing up in their faces like\r\na poker.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Ruling passion strong in death, says Joe, as someone said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94That can be explained by science, says Bloom. It\xe2\x80\x99s only a natural\r\nphenomenon, don\xe2\x80\x99t you see, because on account of the...\r\n\r\nAnd then he starts with his jawbreakers about phenomenon and science and\r\nthis phenomenon and the other phenomenon.\r\n\r\nThe distinguished scientist Herr Professor Luitpold Blumenduft tendered\r\nmedical evidence to the effect that the instantaneous fracture of the\r\ncervical vertebrae and consequent scission of the spinal cord would,\r\naccording to the best approved tradition of medical science, be\r\ncalculated to inevitably produce in the human subject a violent\r\nganglionic stimulus of the nerve centres of the genital apparatus,\r\nthereby causing the elastic pores of the corpora cavernosa to rapidly\r\ndilate in such a way as to instantaneously facilitate the flow of blood\r\nto that part of the human anatomy known as the penis or male organ\r\nresulting in the phenomenon which has been denominated by the faculty a\r\nmorbid upwards and outwards philoprogenitive erection in articulo mortis\r\nper diminutionem capitis.\r\n\r\nSo of course the citizen was only waiting for the wink of the word and\r\nhe starts gassing out of him about the invincibles and the old guard and\r\nthe men of sixtyseven and who fears to speak of ninetyeight and Joe with\r\nhim about all the fellows that were hanged, drawn and transported for\r\nthe cause by drumhead courtmartial and a new Ireland and new this, that\r\nand the other. Talking about new Ireland he ought to go and get a new\r\ndog so he ought. Mangy ravenous brute sniffing and sneezing all round\r\nthe place and scratching his scabs. And round he goes to Bob Doran that\r\nwas standing Alf a half one sucking up for what he could get. So of\r\ncourse Bob Doran starts doing the bloody fool with him:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Give us the paw! Give the paw, doggy! Good old doggy! Give the paw\r\nhere! Give us the paw!\r\n\r\nArrah, bloody end to the paw he\xe2\x80\x99d paw and Alf trying to keep him from\r\ntumbling off the bloody stool atop of the bloody old dog and he talking\r\nall kinds of drivel about training by kindness and thoroughbred dog and\r\nintelligent dog: give you the bloody pip. Then he starts scraping a few\r\nbits of old biscuit out of the bottom of a Jacobs\xe2\x80\x99 tin he told Terry to\r\nbring. Gob, he golloped it down like old boots and his tongue hanging\r\nout of him a yard long for more. Near ate the tin and all, hungry bloody\r\nmongrel.\r\n\r\nAnd the citizen and Bloom having an argument about the point, the\r\nbrothers Sheares and Wolfe Tone beyond on Arbour Hill and Robert Emmet\r\nand die for your country, the Tommy Moore touch about Sara Curran and\r\nshe\xe2\x80\x99s far from the land. And Bloom, of course, with his knockmedown\r\ncigar putting on swank with his lardy face. Phenomenon! The fat heap he\r\nmarried is a nice old phenomenon with a back on her like a ballalley.\r\nTime they were stopping up in the City Arms pisser Burke told me there\r\nwas an old one there with a cracked loodheramaun of a nephew and Bloom\r\ntrying to get the soft side of her doing the mollycoddle playing b\xc3\xa9zique\r\nto come in for a bit of the wampum in her will and not eating meat of a\r\nFriday because the old one was always thumping her craw and taking the\r\nlout out for a walk. And one time he led him the rounds of Dublin and,\r\nby the holy farmer, he never cried crack till he brought him home as\r\ndrunk as a boiled owl and he said he did it to teach him the evils of\r\nalcohol and by herrings, if the three women didn\xe2\x80\x99t near roast him, it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\na queer story, the old one, Bloom\xe2\x80\x99s wife and Mrs O\xe2\x80\x99Dowd that kept the\r\nhotel. Jesus, I had to laugh at pisser Burke taking them off chewing the\r\nfat. And Bloom with his but don\xe2\x80\x99t you see? and but on the other hand.\r\nAnd sure, more be token, the lout I\xe2\x80\x99m told was in Power\xe2\x80\x99s after, the\r\nblender\xe2\x80\x99s, round in Cope street going home footless in a cab five times\r\nin the week after drinking his way through all the samples in the bloody\r\nestablishment. Phenomenon!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94The memory of the dead, says the citizen taking up his pintglass and\r\nglaring at Bloom.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Ay, ay, says Joe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94You don\xe2\x80\x99t grasp my point, says Bloom. What I mean is...\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Sinn Fein! says the citizen. Sinn Fein amhain! The friends we love are\r\nby our side and the foes we hate before us.\r\n\r\nThe last farewell was affecting in the extreme. From the belfries far\r\nand near the funereal deathbell tolled unceasingly while all around the\r\ngloomy precincts rolled the ominous warning of a hundred muffled drums\r\npunctuated by the hollow booming of pieces of ordnance. The deafening\r\nclaps of thunder and the dazzling flashes of lightning which lit up\r\nthe ghastly scene testified that the artillery of heaven had lent its\r\nsupernatural pomp to the already gruesome spectacle. A torrential rain\r\npoured down from the floodgates of the angry heavens upon the\r\nbared heads of the assembled multitude which numbered at the\r\nlowest computation five hundred thousand persons. A posse of Dublin\r\nMetropolitan police superintended by the Chief Commissioner in person\r\nmaintained order in the vast throng for whom the York street brass and\r\nreed band whiled away the intervening time by admirably rendering on\r\ntheir blackdraped instruments the matchless melody endeared to us from\r\nthe cradle by Speranza\xe2\x80\x99s plaintive muse. Special quick excursion trains\r\nand upholstered charabancs had been provided for the comfort of our\r\ncountry cousins of whom there were large contingents. Considerable\r\namusement was caused by the favourite Dublin streetsingers L-n-h-n and\r\nM-ll-g-n who sang The Night before Larry was stretched in their usual\r\nmirth-provoking fashion. Our two inimitable drolls did a roaring trade\r\nwith their broadsheets among lovers of the comedy element and nobody\r\nwho has a corner in his heart for real Irish fun without vulgarity\r\nwill grudge them their hardearned pennies. The children of the Male and\r\nFemale Foundling Hospital who thronged the windows overlooking the scene\r\nwere delighted with this unexpected addition to the day\xe2\x80\x99s entertainment\r\nand a word of praise is due to the Little Sisters of the Poor for their\r\nexcellent idea of affording the poor fatherless and motherless children\r\na genuinely instructive treat. The viceregal houseparty which included\r\nmany wellknown ladies was chaperoned by Their Excellencies to the most\r\nfavourable positions on the grandstand while the picturesque foreign\r\ndelegation known as the Friends of the Emerald Isle was accommodated\r\non a tribune directly opposite. The delegation, present in full force,\r\nconsisted of Commendatore Bacibaci Beninobenone (the semiparalysed doyen\r\nof the party who had to be assisted to his seat by the aid of a\r\npowerful steam crane), Monsieur Pierrepaul Petit\xc3\xa9patant, the Grandjoker\r\nVladinmire Pokethankertscheff, the Archjoker Leopold Rudolph von\r\nSchwanzenbad-Hodenthaler, Countess Marha Vir\xc3\xa1ga Kis\xc3\xa1szony Putr\xc3\xa1pesthi,\r\nHiram Y. Bomboost, Count Athanatos Karamelopulos, Ali Baba Backsheesh\r\nRahat Lokum Effendi, Se\xc3\xb1or Hidalgo Caballero Don Pecadillo y Palabras\r\ny Paternoster de la Malora de la Malaria, Hokopoko Harakiri, Hi Hung\r\nChang, Olaf Kobberkeddelsen, Mynheer Trik van Trumps, Pan Poleaxe\r\nPaddyrisky, Goosepond Prhklstr Kratchinabritchisitch, Borus\r\nHupinkoff, Herr Hurhausdirektorpresident Hans Chuechli-Steuerli,\r\nNationalgymnasiummuseumsanatoriumandsuspensoriumsordinaryprivatdocentgeneralhistoryspecialprofessordoctor\r\nKriegfried Ueberallgemein. All the delegates without exception expressed\r\nthemselves in the strongest possible heterogeneous terms concerning\r\nthe nameless barbarity which they had been called upon to witness. An\r\nanimated altercation (in which all took part) ensued among the F. O.\r\nT. E. I. as to whether the eighth or the ninth of March was the correct\r\ndate of the birth of Ireland\xe2\x80\x99s patron saint. In the course of the\r\nargument cannonballs, scimitars, boomerangs, blunderbusses, stinkpots,\r\nmeatchoppers, umbrellas, catapults, knuckledusters, sandbags, lumps\r\nof pig iron were resorted to and blows were freely exchanged. The\r\nbaby policeman, Constable MacFadden, summoned by special courier from\r\nBooterstown, quickly restored order and with lightning promptitude\r\nproposed the seventeenth of the month as a solution equally honourable\r\nfor both contending parties. The readywitted ninefooter\xe2\x80\x99s suggestion at\r\nonce appealed to all and was unanimously accepted. Constable MacFadden\r\nwas heartily congratulated by all the F. O. T. E. I., several of\r\nwhom were bleeding profusely. Commendatore Beninobenone having been\r\nextricated from underneath the presidential armchair, it was explained\r\nby his legal adviser Avvocato Pagamimi that the various articles\r\nsecreted in his thirtytwo pockets had been abstracted by him during the\r\naffray from the pockets of his junior colleagues in the hope of bringing\r\nthem to their senses. The objects (which included several hundred\r\nladies\xe2\x80\x99 and gentlemen\xe2\x80\x99s gold and silver watches) were promptly restored\r\nto their rightful owners and general harmony reigned supreme.\r\n\r\nQuietly, unassumingly Rumbold stepped on to the scaffold in faultless\r\nmorning dress and wearing his favourite flower, the Gladiolus Cruentus.\r\nHe announced his presence by that gentle Rumboldian cough which so many\r\nhave tried (unsuccessfully) to imitate\xe2\x80\x94short, painstaking yet withal so\r\ncharacteristic of the man. The arrival of the worldrenowned headsman was\r\ngreeted by a roar of acclamation from the huge concourse, the viceregal\r\nladies waving their handkerchiefs in their excitement while the even\r\nmore excitable foreign delegates cheered vociferously in a medley of\r\ncries, hoch, banzai, eljen, zivio, chinchin, polla kronia, hiphip, vive,\r\nAllah, amid which the ringing evviva of the delegate of the land of song\r\n(a high double F recalling those piercingly lovely notes with which\r\nthe eunuch Catalani beglamoured our greatgreatgrandmothers) was easily\r\ndistinguishable. It was exactly seventeen o\xe2\x80\x99clock. The signal for prayer\r\nwas then promptly given by megaphone and in an instant all heads were\r\nbared, the commendatore\xe2\x80\x99s patriarchal sombrero, which has been in the\r\npossession of his family since the revolution of Rienzi, being removed\r\nby his medical adviser in attendance, Dr Pippi. The learned prelate who\r\nadministered the last comforts of holy religion to the hero martyr when\r\nabout to pay the death penalty knelt in a most christian spirit in a\r\npool of rainwater, his cassock above his hoary head, and offered up to\r\nthe throne of grace fervent prayers of supplication. Hard by the block\r\nstood the grim figure of the executioner, his visage being concealed in\r\na tengallon pot with two circular perforated apertures through which his\r\neyes glowered furiously. As he awaited the fatal signal he tested the\r\nedge of his horrible weapon by honing it upon his brawny forearm or\r\ndecapitated in rapid succession a flock of sheep which had been provided\r\nby the admirers of his fell but necessary office. On a handsome mahogany\r\ntable near him were neatly arranged the quartering knife, the various\r\nfinely tempered disembowelling appliances (specially supplied by the\r\nworldfamous firm of cutlers, Messrs John Round and Sons, Sheffield),\r\na terra cotta saucepan for the reception of the duodenum, colon,\r\nblind intestine and appendix etc when successfully extracted and two\r\ncommodious milkjugs destined to receive the most precious blood of the\r\nmost precious victim. The housesteward of the amalgamated cats\xe2\x80\x99 and\r\ndogs\xe2\x80\x99 home was in attendance to convey these vessels when replenished\r\nto that beneficent institution. Quite an excellent repast consisting of\r\nrashers and eggs, fried steak and onions, done to a nicety, delicious\r\nhot breakfast rolls and invigorating tea had been considerately provided\r\nby the authorities for the consumption of the central figure of the\r\ntragedy who was in capital spirits when prepared for death and evinced\r\nthe keenest interest in the proceedings from beginning to end but he,\r\nwith an abnegation rare in these our times, rose nobly to the occasion\r\nand expressed the dying wish (immediately acceded to) that the meal\r\nshould be divided in aliquot parts among the members of the sick and\r\nindigent roomkeepers\xe2\x80\x99 association as a token of his regard and esteem.\r\nThe nec and non plus ultra of emotion were reached when the blushing\r\nbride elect burst her way through the serried ranks of the bystanders\r\nand flung herself upon the muscular bosom of him who was about to be\r\nlaunched into eternity for her sake. The hero folded her willowy form in\r\na loving embrace murmuring fondly Sheila, my own. Encouraged by this use\r\nof her christian name she kissed passionately all the various suitable\r\nareas of his person which the decencies of prison garb permitted her\r\nardour to reach. She swore to him as they mingled the salt streams of\r\ntheir tears that she would ever cherish his memory, that she would never\r\nforget her hero boy who went to his death with a song on his lips as if\r\nhe were but going to a hurling match in Clonturk park. She brought back\r\nto his recollection the happy days of blissful childhood together on the\r\nbanks of Anna Liffey when they had indulged in the innocent pastimes\r\nof the young and, oblivious of the dreadful present, they both laughed\r\nheartily, all the spectators, including the venerable pastor, joining in\r\nthe general merriment. That monster audience simply rocked with delight.\r\nBut anon they were overcome with grief and clasped their hands for the\r\nlast time. A fresh torrent of tears burst from their lachrymal ducts\r\nand the vast concourse of people, touched to the inmost core, broke\r\ninto heartrending sobs, not the least affected being the aged prebendary\r\nhimself. Big strong men, officers of the peace and genial giants of the\r\nroyal Irish constabulary, were making frank use of their handkerchiefs\r\nand it is safe to say that there was not a dry eye in that record\r\nassemblage. A most romantic incident occurred when a handsome young\r\nOxford graduate, noted for his chivalry towards the fair sex, stepped\r\nforward and, presenting his visiting card, bankbook and genealogical\r\ntree, solicited the hand of the hapless young lady, requesting her to\r\nname the day, and was accepted on the spot. Every lady in the audience\r\nwas presented with a tasteful souvenir of the occasion in the shape of\r\na skull and crossbones brooch, a timely and generous act which evoked\r\na fresh outburst of emotion: and when the gallant young Oxonian (the\r\nbearer, by the way, of one of the most timehonoured names in Albion\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhistory) placed on the finger of his blushing fianc\xc3\xa9e an expensive\r\nengagement ring with emeralds set in the form of a fourleaved shamrock\r\nthe excitement knew no bounds. Nay, even the stern provostmarshal,\r\nlieutenantcolonel Tomkin-Maxwell ffrenchmullan Tomlinson, who presided\r\non the sad occasion, he who had blown a considerable number of sepoys\r\nfrom the cannonmouth without flinching, could not now restrain his\r\nnatural emotion. With his mailed gauntlet he brushed away a furtive tear\r\nand was overheard, by those privileged burghers who happened to be in\r\nhis immediate entourage, to murmur to himself in a faltering undertone:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94God blimey if she aint a clinker, that there bleeding tart. Blimey it\r\nmakes me kind of bleeding cry, straight, it does, when I sees her cause\r\nI thinks of my old mashtub what\xe2\x80\x99s waiting for me down Limehouse way.\r\n\r\nSo then the citizen begins talking about the Irish language and the\r\ncorporation meeting and all to that and the shoneens that can\xe2\x80\x99t speak\r\ntheir own language and Joe chipping in because he stuck someone for a\r\nquid and Bloom putting in his old goo with his twopenny stump that\r\nhe cadged off of Joe and talking about the Gaelic league and the\r\nantitreating league and drink, the curse of Ireland. Antitreating is\r\nabout the size of it. Gob, he\xe2\x80\x99d let you pour all manner of drink down\r\nhis throat till the Lord would call him before you\xe2\x80\x99d ever see the froth\r\nof his pint. And one night I went in with a fellow into one of their\r\nmusical evenings, song and dance about she could get up on a truss of\r\nhay she could my Maureen Lay and there was a fellow with a Ballyhooly\r\nblue ribbon badge spiffing out of him in Irish and a lot of colleen\r\nbawns going about with temperance beverages and selling medals\r\nand oranges and lemonade and a few old dry buns, gob, flahoolagh\r\nentertainment, don\xe2\x80\x99t be talking. Ireland sober is Ireland free. And\r\nthen an old fellow starts blowing into his bagpipes and all the gougers\r\nshuffling their feet to the tune the old cow died of. And one or two\r\nsky pilots having an eye around that there was no goings on with the\r\nfemales, hitting below the belt.\r\n\r\nSo howandever, as I was saying, the old dog seeing the tin was empty\r\nstarts mousing around by Joe and me. I\xe2\x80\x99d train him by kindness, so I\r\nwould, if he was my dog. Give him a rousing fine kick now and again\r\nwhere it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t blind him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Afraid he\xe2\x80\x99ll bite you? says the citizen, jeering.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94No, says I. But he might take my leg for a lamppost.\r\n\r\nSo he calls the old dog over.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94What\xe2\x80\x99s on you, Garry? says he.\r\n\r\nThen he starts hauling and mauling and talking to him in Irish and the\r\nold towser growling, letting on to answer, like a duet in the opera.\r\nSuch growling you never heard as they let off between them. Someone that\r\nhas nothing better to do ought to write a letter pro bono publico to the\r\npapers about the muzzling order for a dog the like of that. Growling\r\nand grousing and his eye all bloodshot from the drouth is in it and the\r\nhydrophobia dropping out of his jaws.\r\n\r\nAll those who are interested in the spread of human culture among the\r\nlower animals (and their name is legion) should make a point of not\r\nmissing the really marvellous exhibition of cynanthropy given by the\r\nfamous old Irish red setter wolfdog formerly known by the sobriquet of\r\nGarryowen and recently rechristened by his large circle of friends and\r\nacquaintances Owen Garry. The exhibition, which is the result of years\r\nof training by kindness and a carefully thoughtout dietary system,\r\ncomprises, among other achievements, the recitation of verse. Our\r\ngreatest living phonetic expert (wild horses shall not drag it from us!)\r\nhas left no stone unturned in his efforts to delucidate and compare the\r\nverse recited and has found it bears a striking resemblance (the italics\r\nare ours) to the ranns of ancient Celtic bards. We are not speaking so\r\nmuch of those delightful lovesongs with which the writer who conceals\r\nhis identity under the graceful pseudonym of the Little Sweet Branch has\r\nfamiliarised the bookloving world but rather (as a contributor D. O.\r\nC. points out in an interesting communication published by an evening\r\ncontemporary) of the harsher and more personal note which is found in\r\nthe satirical effusions of the famous Raftery and of Donal MacConsidine\r\nto say nothing of a more modern lyrist at present very much in the\r\npublic eye. We subjoin a specimen which has been rendered into English\r\nby an eminent scholar whose name for the moment we are not at liberty\r\nto disclose though we believe that our readers will find the topical\r\nallusion rather more than an indication. The metrical system of\r\nthe canine original, which recalls the intricate alliterative and\r\nisosyllabic rules of the Welsh englyn, is infinitely more complicated\r\nbut we believe our readers will agree that the spirit has been well\r\ncaught. Perhaps it should be added that the effect is greatly increased\r\nif Owen\xe2\x80\x99s verse be spoken somewhat slowly and indistinctly in a tone\r\nsuggestive of suppressed rancour.\r\n\r\n     The curse of my curses\r\n     Seven days every day\r\n     And seven dry Thursdays\r\n     On you, Barney Kiernan,\r\n     Has no sup of water\r\n     To cool my courage,\r\n     And my guts red roaring\r\n     After Lowry\xe2\x80\x99s lights.\r\n\r\nSo he told Terry to bring some water for the dog and, gob, you could\r\nhear him lapping it up a mile off. And Joe asked him would he have\r\nanother.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I will, says he, a chara, to show there\xe2\x80\x99s no ill feeling.\r\n\r\nGob, he\xe2\x80\x99s not as green as he\xe2\x80\x99s cabbagelooking. Arsing around from one\r\npub to another, leaving it to your own honour, with old Giltrap\xe2\x80\x99s dog\r\nand getting fed up by the ratepayers and corporators. Entertainment for\r\nman and beast. And says Joe:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Could you make a hole in another pint?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Could a swim duck? says I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Same again, Terry, says Joe. Are you sure you won\xe2\x80\x99t have anything in\r\nthe way of liquid refreshment? says he.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Thank you, no, says Bloom. As a matter of fact I just wanted to meet\r\nMartin Cunningham, don\xe2\x80\x99t you see, about this insurance of poor Dignam\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\nMartin asked me to go to the house. You see, he, Dignam, I mean, didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nserve any notice of the assignment on the company at the time and\r\nnominally under the act the mortgagee can\xe2\x80\x99t recover on the policy.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Holy Wars, says Joe, laughing, that\xe2\x80\x99s a good one if old Shylock is\r\nlanded. So the wife comes out top dog, what?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Well, that\xe2\x80\x99s a point, says Bloom, for the wife\xe2\x80\x99s admirers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Whose admirers? says Joe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94The wife\xe2\x80\x99s advisers, I mean, says Bloom.\r\n\r\nThen he starts all confused mucking it up about mortgagor under the act\r\nlike the lord chancellor giving it out on the bench and for the benefit\r\nof the wife and that a trust is created but on the other hand that\r\nDignam owed Bridgeman the money and if now the wife or the widow\r\ncontested the mortgagee\xe2\x80\x99s right till he near had the head of me addled\r\nwith his mortgagor under the act. He was bloody safe he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t run in\r\nhimself under the act that time as a rogue and vagabond only he had a\r\nfriend in court. Selling bazaar tickets or what do you call it royal\r\nHungarian privileged lottery. True as you\xe2\x80\x99re there. O, commend me to an\r\nisraelite! Royal and privileged Hungarian robbery.\r\n\r\nSo Bob Doran comes lurching around asking Bloom to tell Mrs Dignam he\r\nwas sorry for her trouble and he was very sorry about the funeral and\r\nto tell her that he said and everyone who knew him said that there was\r\nnever a truer, a finer than poor little Willy that\xe2\x80\x99s dead to tell her.\r\nChoking with bloody foolery. And shaking Bloom\xe2\x80\x99s hand doing the tragic\r\nto tell her that. Shake hands, brother. You\xe2\x80\x99re a rogue and I\xe2\x80\x99m another.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Let me, said he, so far presume upon our acquaintance which, however\r\nslight it may appear if judged by the standard of mere time, is founded,\r\nas I hope and believe, on a sentiment of mutual esteem as to request of\r\nyou this favour. But, should I have overstepped the limits of reserve\r\nlet the sincerity of my feelings be the excuse for my boldness.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94No, rejoined the other, I appreciate to the full the motives which\r\nactuate your conduct and I shall discharge the office you entrust to\r\nme consoled by the reflection that, though the errand be one of sorrow,\r\nthis proof of your confidence sweetens in some measure the bitterness of\r\nthe cup.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Then suffer me to take your hand, said he. The goodness of your heart,\r\nI feel sure, will dictate to you better than my inadequate words\r\nthe expressions which are most suitable to convey an emotion whose\r\npoignancy, were I to give vent to my feelings, would deprive me even of\r\nspeech.\r\n\r\nAnd off with him and out trying to walk straight. Boosed at five\r\no\xe2\x80\x99clock. Night he was near being lagged only Paddy Leonard knew the\r\nbobby, 14A. Blind to the world up in a shebeen in Bride street after\r\nclosing time, fornicating with two shawls and a bully on guard, drinking\r\nporter out of teacups. And calling himself a Frenchy for the shawls,\r\nJoseph Manuo, and talking against the Catholic religion, and he serving\r\nmass in Adam and Eve\xe2\x80\x99s when he was young with his eyes shut, who wrote\r\nthe new testament, and the old testament, and hugging and smugging. And\r\nthe two shawls killed with the laughing, picking his pockets, the bloody\r\nfool and he spilling the porter all over the bed and the two shawls\r\nscreeching laughing at one another. How is your testament? Have you got\r\nan old testament? Only Paddy was passing there, I tell you what. Then\r\nsee him of a Sunday with his little concubine of a wife, and she wagging\r\nher tail up the aisle of the chapel with her patent boots on her, no\r\nless, and her violets, nice as pie, doing the little lady. Jack Mooney\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsister. And the old prostitute of a mother procuring rooms to street\r\ncouples. Gob, Jack made him toe the line. Told him if he didn\xe2\x80\x99t patch up\r\nthe pot, Jesus, he\xe2\x80\x99d kick the shite out of him.\r\n\r\nSo Terry brought the three pints.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Here, says Joe, doing the honours. Here, citizen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Slan leat, says he.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Fortune, Joe, says I. Good health, citizen.\r\n\r\nGob, he had his mouth half way down the tumbler already. Want a small\r\nfortune to keep him in drinks.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Who is the long fellow running for the mayoralty, Alf? says Joe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Friend of yours, says Alf.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Nannan? says Joe. The mimber?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I won\xe2\x80\x99t mention any names, says Alf.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I thought so, says Joe. I saw him up at that meeting now with William\r\nField, M. P., the cattle traders.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Hairy Iopas, says the citizen, that exploded volcano, the darling of\r\nall countries and the idol of his own.\r\n\r\nSo Joe starts telling the citizen about the foot and mouth disease\r\nand the cattle traders and taking action in the matter and the citizen\r\nsending them all to the rightabout and Bloom coming out with his\r\nsheepdip for the scab and a hoose drench for coughing calves and the\r\nguaranteed remedy for timber tongue. Because he was up one time in a\r\nknacker\xe2\x80\x99s yard. Walking about with his book and pencil here\xe2\x80\x99s my head\r\nand my heels are coming till Joe Cuffe gave him the order of the boot\r\nfor giving lip to a grazier. Mister Knowall. Teach your grandmother how\r\nto milk ducks. Pisser Burke was telling me in the hotel the wife used\r\nto be in rivers of tears some times with Mrs O\xe2\x80\x99Dowd crying her eyes out\r\nwith her eight inches of fat all over her. Couldn\xe2\x80\x99t loosen her farting\r\nstrings but old cod\xe2\x80\x99s eye was waltzing around her showing her how to do\r\nit. What\xe2\x80\x99s your programme today? Ay. Humane methods. Because the poor\r\nanimals suffer and experts say and the best known remedy that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ncause pain to the animal and on the sore spot administer gently. Gob,\r\nhe\xe2\x80\x99d have a soft hand under a hen.\r\n\r\nGa Ga Gara. Klook Klook Klook. Black Liz is our hen. She lays eggs for\r\nus. When she lays her egg she is so glad. Gara. Klook Klook Klook. Then\r\ncomes good uncle Leo. He puts his hand under black Liz and takes her\r\nfresh egg. Ga ga ga ga Gara. Klook Klook Klook.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Anyhow, says Joe, Field and Nannetti are going over tonight to London\r\nto ask about it on the floor of the house of commons.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Are you sure, says Bloom, the councillor is going? I wanted to see him,\r\nas it happens.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Well, he\xe2\x80\x99s going off by the mailboat, says Joe, tonight.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94That\xe2\x80\x99s too bad, says Bloom. I wanted particularly. Perhaps only Mr\r\nField is going. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t phone. No. You\xe2\x80\x99re sure?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Nannan\xe2\x80\x99s going too, says Joe. The league told him to ask a question\r\ntomorrow about the commissioner of police forbidding Irish games in the\r\npark. What do you think of that, citizen? The Sluagh na h-Eireann.\r\n\r\nMr Cowe Conacre (Multifarnham. Nat.): Arising out of the question of\r\nmy honourable friend, the member for Shillelagh, may I ask the right\r\nhonourable gentleman whether the government has issued orders that these\r\nanimals shall be slaughtered though no medical evidence is forthcoming\r\nas to their pathological condition?\r\n\r\nMr Allfours (Tamoshant. Con.): Honourable members are already in\r\npossession of the evidence produced before a committee of the whole\r\nhouse. I feel I cannot usefully add anything to that. The answer to the\r\nhonourable member\xe2\x80\x99s question is in the affirmative.\r\n\r\nMr Orelli O\xe2\x80\x99Reilly (Montenotte. Nat.): Have similar orders been issued\r\nfor the slaughter of human animals who dare to play Irish games in the\r\nPhoenix park?\r\n\r\nMr Allfours: The answer is in the negative.\r\n\r\nMr Cowe Conacre: Has the right honourable gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s famous\r\nMitchelstown telegram inspired the policy of gentlemen on the Treasury\r\nbench? (O! O!)\r\n\r\nMr Allfours: I must have notice of that question.\r\n\r\nMr Staylewit (Buncombe. Ind.): Don\xe2\x80\x99t hesitate to shoot.\r\n\r\n(Ironical opposition cheers.)\r\n\r\nThe speaker: Order! Order!\r\n\r\n(The house rises. Cheers.)\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94There\xe2\x80\x99s the man, says Joe, that made the Gaelic sports revival. There\r\nhe is sitting there. The man that got away James Stephens. The champion\r\nof all Ireland at putting the sixteen pound shot. What was your best\r\nthrow, citizen?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Na bacleis, says the citizen, letting on to be modest. There was a time\r\nI was as good as the next fellow anyhow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Put it there, citizen, says Joe. You were and a bloody sight better.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Is that really a fact? says Alf.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Yes, says Bloom. That\xe2\x80\x99s well known. Did you not know that?\r\n\r\nSo off they started about Irish sports and shoneen games the like of\r\nlawn tennis and about hurley and putting the stone and racy of the soil\r\nand building up a nation once again and all to that. And of course Bloom\r\nhad to have his say too about if a fellow had a rower\xe2\x80\x99s heart violent\r\nexercise was bad. I declare to my antimacassar if you took up a straw\r\nfrom the bloody floor and if you said to Bloom: Look at, Bloom. Do you\r\nsee that straw? That\xe2\x80\x99s a straw. Declare to my aunt he\xe2\x80\x99d talk about it\r\nfor an hour so he would and talk steady.\r\n\r\nA most interesting discussion took place in the ancient hall of Brian\r\nO\xe2\x80\x99Ciarnain\xe2\x80\x99s in Sraid na Bretaine Bheag, under the auspices of Sluagh na\r\nh-Eireann, on the revival of ancient Gaelic sports and the importance of\r\nphysical culture, as understood in ancient Greece and ancient Rome\r\nand ancient Ireland, for the development of the race. The venerable\r\npresident of the noble order was in the chair and the attendance was\r\nof large dimensions. After an instructive discourse by the chairman,\r\na magnificent oration eloquently and forcibly expressed, a most\r\ninteresting and instructive discussion of the usual high standard of\r\nexcellence ensued as to the desirability of the revivability of the\r\nancient games and sports of our ancient Panceltic forefathers. The\r\nwellknown and highly respected worker in the cause of our old tongue, Mr\r\nJoseph M\xe2\x80\x99Carthy Hynes, made an eloquent appeal for the resuscitation of\r\nthe ancient Gaelic sports and pastimes, practised morning and evening\r\nby Finn MacCool, as calculated to revive the best traditions of manly\r\nstrength and prowess handed down to us from ancient ages. L. Bloom, who\r\nmet with a mixed reception of applause and hisses, having espoused the\r\nnegative the vocalist chairman brought the discussion to a close, in\r\nresponse to repeated requests and hearty plaudits from all parts of\r\na bumper house, by a remarkably noteworthy rendering of the immortal\r\nThomas Osborne Davis\xe2\x80\x99 evergreen verses (happily too familiar to need\r\nrecalling here) A nation once again in the execution of which the\r\nveteran patriot champion may be said without fear of contradiction\r\nto have fairly excelled himself. The Irish Caruso-Garibaldi was in\r\nsuperlative form and his stentorian notes were heard to the greatest\r\nadvantage in the timehonoured anthem sung as only our citizen can sing\r\nit. His superb highclass vocalism, which by its superquality greatly\r\nenhanced his already international reputation, was vociferously\r\napplauded by the large audience among which were to be noticed many\r\nprominent members of the clergy as well as representatives of the press\r\nand the bar and the other learned professions. The proceedings then\r\nterminated.\r\n\r\nAmongst the clergy present were the very rev. William Delany, S. J., L.\r\nL. D.; the rt rev. Gerald Molloy, D. D.; the rev. P. J. Kavanagh, C. S.\r\nSp.; the rev. T. Waters, C. C.; the rev. John M. Ivers, P. P.; the rev.\r\nP. J. Cleary, O. S. F.; the rev. L. J. Hickey, O. P.; the very rev. Fr.\r\nNicholas, O. S. F. C.; the very rev. B. Gorman, O. D. C.; the rev. T.\r\nMaher, S. J.; the very rev. James Murphy, S. J.; the rev. John Lavery,\r\nV. F.; the very rev. William Doherty, D. D.; the rev. Peter Fagan, O.\r\nM.; the rev. T. Brangan, O. S. A.; the rev. J. Flavin, C. C.; the\r\nrev. M. A. Hackett, C. C.; the rev. W. Hurley, C. C.; the rt rev. Mgr\r\nM\xe2\x80\x99Manus, V. G.; the rev. B. R. Slattery, O. M. I.; the very rev. M.\r\nD. Scally, P. P.; the rev. F. T. Purcell, O. P.; the very rev. Timothy\r\ncanon Gorman, P. P.; the rev. J. Flanagan, C. C. The laity included P.\r\nFay, T. Quirke, etc., etc.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Talking about violent exercise, says Alf, were you at that\r\nKeogh-Bennett match?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94No, says Joe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I heard So and So made a cool hundred quid over it, says Alf.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Who? Blazes? says Joe.\r\n\r\nAnd says Bloom:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94What I meant about tennis, for example, is the agility and training the\r\neye.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Ay, Blazes, says Alf. He let out that Myler was on the beer to run up\r\nthe odds and he swatting all the time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94We know him, says the citizen. The traitor\xe2\x80\x99s son. We know what put\r\nEnglish gold in his pocket.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94True for you, says Joe.\r\n\r\nAnd Bloom cuts in again about lawn tennis and the circulation of the\r\nblood, asking Alf:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Now, don\xe2\x80\x99t you think, Bergan?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Myler dusted the floor with him, says Alf. Heenan and Sayers was only\r\na bloody fool to it. Handed him the father and mother of a beating. See\r\nthe little kipper not up to his navel and the big fellow swiping. God,\r\nhe gave him one last puck in the wind, Queensberry rules and all, made\r\nhim puke what he never ate.\r\n\r\nIt was a historic and a hefty battle when Myler and Percy were scheduled\r\nto don the gloves for the purse of fifty sovereigns. Handicapped as he\r\nwas by lack of poundage, Dublin\xe2\x80\x99s pet lamb made up for it by superlative\r\nskill in ringcraft. The final bout of fireworks was a gruelling for both\r\nchampions. The welterweight sergeantmajor had tapped some lively claret\r\nin the previous mixup during which Keogh had been receivergeneral of\r\nrights and lefts, the artilleryman putting in some neat work on the\r\npet\xe2\x80\x99s nose, and Myler came on looking groggy. The soldier got to\r\nbusiness, leading off with a powerful left jab to which the Irish\r\ngladiator retaliated by shooting out a stiff one flush to the point of\r\nBennett\xe2\x80\x99s jaw. The redcoat ducked but the Dubliner lifted him with a\r\nleft hook, the body punch being a fine one. The men came to handigrips.\r\nMyler quickly became busy and got his man under, the bout ending with\r\nthe bulkier man on the ropes, Myler punishing him. The Englishman, whose\r\nright eye was nearly closed, took his corner where he was liberally\r\ndrenched with water and when the bell went came on gamey and brimful of\r\npluck, confident of knocking out the fistic Eblanite in jigtime. It was\r\na fight to a finish and the best man for it. The two fought like tigers\r\nand excitement ran fever high. The referee twice cautioned Pucking Percy\r\nfor holding but the pet was tricky and his footwork a treat to watch.\r\nAfter a brisk exchange of courtesies during which a smart upper cut of\r\nthe military man brought blood freely from his opponent\xe2\x80\x99s mouth the\r\nlamb suddenly waded in all over his man and landed a terrific left to\r\nBattling Bennett\xe2\x80\x99s stomach, flooring him flat. It was a knockout clean\r\nand clever. Amid tense expectation the Portobello bruiser was being\r\ncounted out when Bennett\xe2\x80\x99s second Ole Pfotts Wettstein threw in the\r\ntowel and the Santry boy was declared victor to the frenzied cheers of\r\nthe public who broke through the ringropes and fairly mobbed him with\r\ndelight.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94He knows which side his bread is buttered, says Alf. I hear he\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nrunning a concert tour now up in the north.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94He is, says Joe. Isn\xe2\x80\x99t he?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Who? says Bloom. Ah, yes. That\xe2\x80\x99s quite true. Yes, a kind of summer\r\ntour, you see. Just a holiday.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Mrs B. is the bright particular star, isn\xe2\x80\x99t she? says Joe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94My wife? says Bloom. She\xe2\x80\x99s singing, yes. I think it will be a success\r\ntoo.\r\n\r\nHe\xe2\x80\x99s an excellent man to organise. Excellent.\r\n\r\nHoho begob says I to myself says I. That explains the milk in the\r\ncocoanut and absence of hair on the animal\xe2\x80\x99s chest. Blazes doing the\r\ntootle on the flute. Concert tour. Dirty Dan the dodger\xe2\x80\x99s son off Island\r\nbridge that sold the same horses twice over to the government to fight\r\nthe Boers. Old Whatwhat. I called about the poor and water rate, Mr\r\nBoylan. You what? The water rate, Mr Boylan. You whatwhat? That\xe2\x80\x99s the\r\nbucko that\xe2\x80\x99ll organise her, take my tip. \xe2\x80\x98Twixt me and you Caddareesh.\r\n\r\nPride of Calpe\xe2\x80\x99s rocky mount, the ravenhaired daughter of Tweedy. There\r\ngrew she to peerless beauty where loquat and almond scent the air. The\r\ngardens of Alameda knew her step: the garths of olives knew and bowed.\r\nThe chaste spouse of Leopold is she: Marion of the bountiful bosoms.\r\n\r\nAnd lo, there entered one of the clan of the O\xe2\x80\x99Molloy\xe2\x80\x99s, a comely hero\r\nof white face yet withal somewhat ruddy, his majesty\xe2\x80\x99s counsel learned\r\nin the law, and with him the prince and heir of the noble line of\r\nLambert.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Hello, Ned.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Hello, Alf.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Hello, Jack.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Hello, Joe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94God save you, says the citizen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Save you kindly, says J. J. What\xe2\x80\x99ll it be, Ned?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Half one, says Ned.\r\n\r\nSo J. J. ordered the drinks.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Were you round at the court? says Joe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Yes, says J. J. He\xe2\x80\x99ll square that, Ned, says he.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Hope so, says Ned.\r\n\r\nNow what were those two at? J. J. getting him off the grand jury list\r\nand the other give him a leg over the stile. With his name in Stubbs\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\nPlaying cards, hobnobbing with flash toffs with a swank glass in their\r\neye, adrinking fizz and he half smothered in writs and garnishee orders.\r\nPawning his gold watch in Cummins of Francis street where no-one would\r\nknow him in the private office when I was there with Pisser releasing\r\nhis boots out of the pop. What\xe2\x80\x99s your name, sir? Dunne, says he. Ay, and\r\ndone says I. Gob, he\xe2\x80\x99ll come home by weeping cross one of those days,\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m thinking.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Did you see that bloody lunatic Breen round there? says Alf. U.P.: up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Yes, says J. J. Looking for a private detective.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Ay, says Ned. And he wanted right go wrong to address the court only\r\nCorny Kelleher got round him telling him to get the handwriting examined\r\nfirst.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Ten thousand pounds, says Alf, laughing. God, I\xe2\x80\x99d give anything to hear\r\nhim before a judge and jury.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Was it you did it, Alf? says Joe. The truth, the whole truth and\r\nnothing but the truth, so help you Jimmy Johnson.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Me? says Alf. Don\xe2\x80\x99t cast your nasturtiums on my character.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Whatever statement you make, says Joe, will be taken down in evidence\r\nagainst you.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Of course an action would lie, says J. J. It implies that he is not\r\ncompos mentis. U.P.: up.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Compos your eye! says Alf, laughing. Do you know that he\xe2\x80\x99s balmy? Look\r\nat his head. Do you know that some mornings he has to get his hat on\r\nwith a shoehorn.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Yes, says J. J., but the truth of a libel is no defence to an\r\nindictment for publishing it in the eyes of the law.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Ha ha, Alf, says Joe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Still, says Bloom, on account of the poor woman, I mean his wife.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Pity about her, says the citizen. Or any other woman marries a half and\r\nhalf.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94How half and half? says Bloom. Do you mean he...\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Half and half I mean, says the citizen. A fellow that\xe2\x80\x99s neither fish\r\nnor flesh.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Nor good red herring, says Joe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94That what\xe2\x80\x99s I mean, says the citizen. A pishogue, if you know what that\r\nis.\r\n\r\nBegob I saw there was trouble coming. And Bloom explaining he meant on\r\naccount of it being cruel for the wife having to go round after the\r\nold stuttering fool. Cruelty to animals so it is to let that bloody\r\npovertystricken Breen out on grass with his beard out tripping him,\r\nbringing down the rain. And she with her nose cockahoop after she\r\nmarried him because a cousin of his old fellow\xe2\x80\x99s was pewopener to the\r\npope. Picture of him on the wall with his Smashall Sweeney\xe2\x80\x99s moustaches,\r\nthe signior Brini from Summerhill, the eyetallyano, papal Zouave to the\r\nHoly Father, has left the quay and gone to Moss street. And who was\r\nhe, tell us? A nobody, two pair back and passages, at seven shillings a\r\nweek, and he covered with all kinds of breastplates bidding defiance to\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94And moreover, says J. J., a postcard is publication. It was held to be\r\nsufficient evidence of malice in the testcase Sadgrove v. Hole. In my\r\nopinion an action might lie.\r\n\r\nSix and eightpence, please. Who wants your opinion? Let us drink our\r\npints in peace. Gob, we won\xe2\x80\x99t be let even do that much itself.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Well, good health, Jack, says Ned.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Good health, Ned, says J. J.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94-There he is again, says Joe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Where? says Alf.\r\n\r\nAnd begob there he was passing the door with his books under his oxter\r\nand the wife beside him and Corny Kelleher with his wall eye looking in\r\nas they went past, talking to him like a father, trying to sell him a\r\nsecondhand coffin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94How did that Canada swindle case go off? says Joe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Remanded, says J. J.\r\n\r\nOne of the bottlenosed fraternity it was went by the name of James\r\nWought alias Saphiro alias Spark and Spiro, put an ad in the papers\r\nsaying he\xe2\x80\x99d give a passage to Canada for twenty bob. What? Do you see\r\nany green in the white of my eye? Course it was a bloody barney. What?\r\nSwindled them all, skivvies and badhachs from the county Meath, ay, and\r\nhis own kidney too. J. J. was telling us there was an ancient Hebrew\r\nZaretsky or something weeping in the witnessbox with his hat on him,\r\nswearing by the holy Moses he was stuck for two quid.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Who tried the case? says Joe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Recorder, says Ned.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Poor old sir Frederick, says Alf, you can cod him up to the two eyes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Heart as big as a lion, says Ned. Tell him a tale of woe about arrears\r\nof rent and a sick wife and a squad of kids and, faith, he\xe2\x80\x99ll dissolve\r\nin tears on the bench.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Ay, says Alf. Reuben J was bloody lucky he didn\xe2\x80\x99t clap him in the dock\r\nthe other day for suing poor little Gumley that\xe2\x80\x99s minding stones, for\r\nthe corporation there near Butt bridge.\r\n\r\nAnd he starts taking off the old recorder letting on to cry:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94A most scandalous thing! This poor hardworking man! How many children?\r\nTen, did you say?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Yes, your worship. And my wife has the typhoid.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94And the wife with typhoid fever! Scandalous! Leave the court\r\nimmediately, sir. No, sir, I\xe2\x80\x99ll make no order for payment. How dare you,\r\nsir, come up before me and ask me to make an order! A poor hardworking\r\nindustrious man! I dismiss the case.\r\n\r\nAnd whereas on the sixteenth day of the month of the oxeyed goddess and\r\nin the third week after the feastday of the Holy and Undivided Trinity,\r\nthe daughter of the skies, the virgin moon being then in her first\r\nquarter, it came to pass that those learned judges repaired them to the\r\nhalls of law. There master Courtenay, sitting in his own chamber, gave\r\nhis rede and master Justice Andrews, sitting without a jury in the\r\nprobate court, weighed well and pondered the claim of the first\r\nchargeant upon the property in the matter of the will propounded and\r\nfinal testamentary disposition in re the real and personal estate of the\r\nlate lamented Jacob Halliday, vintner, deceased, versus Livingstone, an\r\ninfant, of unsound mind, and another. And to the solemn court of Green\r\nstreet there came sir Frederick the Falconer. And he sat him there about\r\nthe hour of five o\xe2\x80\x99clock to administer the law of the brehons at the\r\ncommission for all that and those parts to be holden in and for the\r\ncounty of the city of Dublin. And there sat with him the high sinhedrim\r\nof the twelve tribes of Iar, for every tribe one man, of the tribe of\r\nPatrick and of the tribe of Hugh and of the tribe of Owen and of the\r\ntribe of Conn and of the tribe of Oscar and of the tribe of Fergus and\r\nof the tribe of Finn and of the tribe of Dermot and of the tribe of\r\nCormac and of the tribe of Kevin and of the tribe of Caolte and of the\r\ntribe of Ossian, there being in all twelve good men and true. And he\r\nconjured them by Him who died on rood that they should well and\r\ntruly try and true deliverance make in the issue joined between their\r\nsovereign lord the king and the prisoner at the bar and true verdict\r\ngive according to the evidence so help them God and kiss the book. And\r\nthey rose in their seats, those twelve of Iar, and they swore by\r\nthe name of Him Who is from everlasting that they would do His\r\nrightwiseness. And straightway the minions of the law led forth from\r\ntheir donjon keep one whom the sleuthhounds of justice had apprehended\r\nin consequence of information received. And they shackled him hand and\r\nfoot and would take of him ne bail ne mainprise but preferred a charge\r\nagainst him for he was a malefactor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Those are nice things, says the citizen, coming over here to Ireland\r\nfilling the country with bugs.\r\n\r\nSo Bloom lets on he heard nothing and he starts talking with Joe,\r\ntelling him he needn\xe2\x80\x99t trouble about that little matter till the first\r\nbut if he would just say a word to Mr Crawford. And so Joe swore high\r\nand holy by this and by that he\xe2\x80\x99d do the devil and all.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Because, you see, says Bloom, for an advertisement you must have\r\nrepetition. That\xe2\x80\x99s the whole secret.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Rely on me, says Joe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Swindling the peasants, says the citizen, and the poor of Ireland. We\r\nwant no more strangers in our house.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94O, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure that will be all right, Hynes, says Bloom. It\xe2\x80\x99s just that\r\nKeyes, you see.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Consider that done, says Joe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Very kind of you, says Bloom.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94The strangers, says the citizen. Our own fault. We let them come in.\r\nWe brought them in. The adulteress and her paramour brought the Saxon\r\nrobbers here.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Decree nisi, says J. J.\r\n\r\nAnd Bloom letting on to be awfully deeply interested in nothing, a\r\nspider\xe2\x80\x99s web in the corner behind the barrel, and the citizen scowling\r\nafter him and the old dog at his feet looking up to know who to bite and\r\nwhen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94A dishonoured wife, says the citizen, that\xe2\x80\x99s what\xe2\x80\x99s the cause of all\r\nour misfortunes.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94And here she is, says Alf, that was giggling over the Police Gazette\r\nwith Terry on the counter, in all her warpaint.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Give us a squint at her, says I.\r\n\r\nAnd what was it only one of the smutty yankee pictures Terry borrows off\r\nof Corny Kelleher. Secrets for enlarging your private parts. Misconduct\r\nof society belle. Norman W. Tupper, wealthy Chicago contractor, finds\r\npretty but faithless wife in lap of officer Taylor. Belle in her\r\nbloomers misconducting herself, and her fancyman feeling for her tickles\r\nand Norman W. Tupper bouncing in with his peashooter just in time to be\r\nlate after she doing the trick of the loop with officer Taylor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94O jakers, Jenny, says Joe, how short your shirt is!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94There\xe2\x80\x99s hair, Joe, says I. Get a queer old tailend of corned beef off\r\nof that one, what?\r\n\r\nSo anyhow in came John Wyse Nolan and Lenehan with him with a face on\r\nhim as long as a late breakfast.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Well, says the citizen, what\xe2\x80\x99s the latest from the scene of action?\r\nWhat did those tinkers in the city hall at their caucus meeting decide\r\nabout the Irish language?\r\n\r\nO\xe2\x80\x99Nolan, clad in shining armour, low bending made obeisance to the\r\npuissant and high and mighty chief of all Erin and did him to wit of\r\nthat which had befallen, how that the grave elders of the most obedient\r\ncity, second of the realm, had met them in the tholsel, and there, after\r\ndue prayers to the gods who dwell in ether supernal, had taken solemn\r\ncounsel whereby they might, if so be it might be, bring once more into\r\nhonour among mortal men the winged speech of the seadivided Gael.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94It\xe2\x80\x99s on the march, says the citizen. To hell with the bloody brutal\r\nSassenachs and their patois.\r\n\r\nSo J. J. puts in a word, doing the toff about one story was good till\r\nyou heard another and blinking facts and the Nelson policy, putting your\r\nblind eye to the telescope and drawing up a bill of attainder to impeach\r\na nation, and Bloom trying to back him up moderation and botheration and\r\ntheir colonies and their civilisation.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Their syphilisation, you mean, says the citizen. To hell with them! The\r\ncurse of a goodfornothing God light sideways on the bloody thicklugged\r\nsons of whores\xe2\x80\x99 gets! No music and no art and no literature worthy of\r\nthe name. Any civilisation they have they stole from us. Tonguetied sons\r\nof bastards\xe2\x80\x99 ghosts.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94The European family, says J. J....\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94They\xe2\x80\x99re not European, says the citizen. I was in Europe with Kevin Egan\r\nof Paris. You wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t see a trace of them or their language anywhere in\r\nEurope except in a cabinet d\xe2\x80\x99aisance.\r\n\r\nAnd says John Wyse:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Full many a flower is born to blush unseen.\r\n\r\nAnd says Lenehan that knows a bit of the lingo:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Conspuez les Anglais! Perfide Albion!\r\n\r\nHe said and then lifted he in his rude great brawny strengthy hands the\r\nmedher of dark strong foamy ale and, uttering his tribal slogan Lamh\r\nDearg Abu, he drank to the undoing of his foes, a race of mighty\r\nvalorous heroes, rulers of the waves, who sit on thrones of alabaster\r\nsilent as the deathless gods.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94What\xe2\x80\x99s up with you, says I to Lenehan. You look like a fellow that had\r\nlost a bob and found a tanner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Gold cup, says he.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Who won, Mr Lenehan? says Terry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Throwaway, says he, at twenty to one. A rank outsider. And the rest\r\nnowhere.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94And Bass\xe2\x80\x99s mare? says Terry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Still running, says he. We\xe2\x80\x99re all in a cart. Boylan plunged two quid on\r\nmy tip Sceptre for himself and a lady friend.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I had half a crown myself, says Terry, on Zinfandel that Mr Flynn gave\r\nme. Lord Howard de Walden\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Twenty to one, says Lenehan. Such is life in an outhouse. Throwaway,\r\nsays he. Takes the biscuit, and talking about bunions. Frailty, thy name\r\nis Sceptre.\r\n\r\nSo he went over to the biscuit tin Bob Doran left to see if there was\r\nanything he could lift on the nod, the old cur after him backing his\r\nluck with his mangy snout up. Old Mother Hubbard went to the cupboard.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Not there, my child, says he.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Keep your pecker up, says Joe. She\xe2\x80\x99d have won the money only for the\r\nother dog.\r\n\r\nAnd J. J. and the citizen arguing about law and history with Bloom\r\nsticking in an odd word.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Some people, says Bloom, can see the mote in others\xe2\x80\x99 eyes but they\r\ncan\xe2\x80\x99t see the beam in their own.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Raimeis, says the citizen. There\xe2\x80\x99s no-one as blind as the fellow that\r\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t see, if you know what that means. Where are our missing twenty\r\nmillions of Irish should be here today instead of four, our lost tribes?\r\nAnd our potteries and textiles, the finest in the whole world! And our\r\nwool that was sold in Rome in the time of Juvenal and our flax and our\r\ndamask from the looms of Antrim and our Limerick lace, our tanneries and\r\nour white flint glass down there by Ballybough and our Huguenot poplin\r\nthat we have since Jacquard de Lyon and our woven silk and our Foxford\r\ntweeds and ivory raised point from the Carmelite convent in New Ross,\r\nnothing like it in the whole wide world. Where are the Greek merchants\r\nthat came through the pillars of Hercules, the Gibraltar now grabbed by\r\nthe foe of mankind, with gold and Tyrian purple to sell in Wexford at\r\nthe fair of Carmen? Read Tacitus and Ptolemy, even Giraldus Cambrensis.\r\nWine, peltries, Connemara marble, silver from Tipperary, second to none,\r\nour farfamed horses even today, the Irish hobbies, with king Philip\r\nof Spain offering to pay customs duties for the right to fish in our\r\nwaters. What do the yellowjohns of Anglia owe us for our ruined trade\r\nand our ruined hearths? And the beds of the Barrow and Shannon they\r\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t deepen with millions of acres of marsh and bog to make us all die\r\nof consumption?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94As treeless as Portugal we\xe2\x80\x99ll be soon, says John Wyse, or Heligoland\r\nwith its one tree if something is not done to reafforest the land.\r\nLarches, firs, all the trees of the conifer family are going fast. I was\r\nreading a report of lord Castletown\xe2\x80\x99s...\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Save them, says the citizen, the giant ash of Galway and the chieftain\r\nelm of Kildare with a fortyfoot bole and an acre of foliage. Save the\r\ntrees of Ireland for the future men of Ireland on the fair hills of\r\nEire, O.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Europe has its eyes on you, says Lenehan.\r\n\r\nThe fashionable international world attended en masse this afternoon\r\nat the wedding of the chevalier Jean Wyse de Neaulan, grand high chief\r\nranger of the Irish National Foresters, with Miss Fir Conifer of Pine\r\nValley. Lady Sylvester Elmshade, Mrs Barbara Lovebirch, Mrs Poll Ash,\r\nMrs Holly Hazeleyes, Miss Daphne Bays, Miss Dorothy Canebrake, Mrs Clyde\r\nTwelvetrees, Mrs Rowan Greene, Mrs Helen Vinegadding, Miss Virginia\r\nCreeper, Miss Gladys Beech, Miss Olive Garth, Miss Blanche Maple, Mrs\r\nMaud Mahogany, Miss Myra Myrtle, Miss Priscilla Elderflower, Miss\r\nBee Honeysuckle, Miss Grace Poplar, Miss O Mimosa San, Miss Rachel\r\nCedarfrond, the Misses Lilian and Viola Lilac, Miss Timidity Aspenall,\r\nMrs Kitty Dewey-Mosse, Miss May Hawthorne, Mrs Gloriana Palme, Mrs Liana\r\nForrest, Mrs Arabella Blackwood and Mrs Norma Holyoake of Oakholme Regis\r\ngraced the ceremony by their presence. The bride who was given away by\r\nher father, the M\xe2\x80\x99Conifer of the Glands, looked exquisitely charming in\r\na creation carried out in green mercerised silk, moulded on an underslip\r\nof gloaming grey, sashed with a yoke of broad emerald and finished with\r\na triple flounce of darkerhued fringe, the scheme being relieved by\r\nbretelles and hip insertions of acorn bronze. The maids of honour, Miss\r\nLarch Conifer and Miss Spruce Conifer, sisters of the bride, wore very\r\nbecoming costumes in the same tone, a dainty motif of plume rose being\r\nworked into the pleats in a pinstripe and repeated capriciously in the\r\njadegreen toques in the form of heron feathers of paletinted coral.\r\nSenhor Enrique Flor presided at the organ with his wellknown ability\r\nand, in addition to the prescribed numbers of the nuptial mass, played\r\na new and striking arrangement of Woodman, spare that tree at the\r\nconclusion of the service. On leaving the church of Saint Fiacre in\r\nHorto after the papal blessing the happy pair were subjected to a\r\nplayful crossfire of hazelnuts, beechmast, bayleaves, catkins of willow,\r\nivytod, hollyberries, mistletoe sprigs and quicken shoots. Mr and Mrs\r\nWyse Conifer Neaulan will spend a quiet honeymoon in the Black Forest.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94And our eyes are on Europe, says the citizen. We had our trade with\r\nSpain and the French and with the Flemings before those mongrels were\r\npupped, Spanish ale in Galway, the winebark on the winedark waterway.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94And will again, says Joe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94And with the help of the holy mother of God we will again, says the\r\ncitizen, clapping his thigh. Our harbours that are empty will be full\r\nagain, Queenstown, Kinsale, Galway, Blacksod Bay, Ventry in the kingdom\r\nof Kerry, Killybegs, the third largest harbour in the wide world with\r\na fleet of masts of the Galway Lynches and the Cavan O\xe2\x80\x99Reillys and the\r\nO\xe2\x80\x99Kennedys of Dublin when the earl of Desmond could make a treaty with\r\nthe emperor Charles the Fifth himself. And will again, says he, when the\r\nfirst Irish battleship is seen breasting the waves with our own flag to\r\nthe fore, none of your Henry Tudor\xe2\x80\x99s harps, no, the oldest flag afloat,\r\nthe flag of the province of Desmond and Thomond, three crowns on a blue\r\nfield, the three sons of Milesius.\r\n\r\nAnd he took the last swig out of the pint. Moya. All wind and piss like\r\na tanyard cat. Cows in Connacht have long horns. As much as his bloody\r\nlife is worth to go down and address his tall talk to the assembled\r\nmultitude in Shanagolden where he daren\xe2\x80\x99t show his nose with the Molly\r\nMaguires looking for him to let daylight through him for grabbing the\r\nholding of an evicted tenant.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Hear, hear to that, says John Wyse. What will you have?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94An imperial yeomanry, says Lenehan, to celebrate the occasion.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Half one, Terry, says John Wyse, and a hands up. Terry! Are you asleep?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Yes, sir, says Terry. Small whisky and bottle of Allsop. Right, sir.\r\n\r\nHanging over the bloody paper with Alf looking for spicy bits instead of\r\nattending to the general public. Picture of a butting match, trying to\r\ncrack their bloody skulls, one chap going for the other with his head\r\ndown like a bull at a gate. And another one: Black Beast Burned in\r\nOmaha, Ga. A lot of Deadwood Dicks in slouch hats and they firing at a\r\nSambo strung up in a tree with his tongue out and a bonfire under\r\nhim. Gob, they ought to drown him in the sea after and electrocute and\r\ncrucify him to make sure of their job.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94But what about the fighting navy, says Ned, that keeps our foes at bay?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you what about it, says the citizen. Hell upon earth it is.\r\nRead the revelations that\xe2\x80\x99s going on in the papers about flogging on\r\nthe training ships at Portsmouth. A fellow writes that calls himself\r\nDisgusted One.\r\n\r\nSo he starts telling us about corporal punishment and about the crew\r\nof tars and officers and rearadmirals drawn up in cocked hats and the\r\nparson with his protestant bible to witness punishment and a young lad\r\nbrought out, howling for his ma, and they tie him down on the buttend of\r\na gun.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94A rump and dozen, says the citizen, was what that old ruffian sir John\r\nBeresford called it but the modern God\xe2\x80\x99s Englishman calls it caning on\r\nthe breech.\r\n\r\nAnd says John Wyse:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x98Tis a custom more honoured in the breach than in the observance.\r\n\r\nThen he was telling us the master at arms comes along with a long cane\r\nand he draws out and he flogs the bloody backside off of the poor lad\r\ntill he yells meila murder.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94That\xe2\x80\x99s your glorious British navy, says the citizen, that bosses the\r\nearth. The fellows that never will be slaves, with the only hereditary\r\nchamber on the face of God\xe2\x80\x99s earth and their land in the hands of a\r\ndozen gamehogs and cottonball barons. That\xe2\x80\x99s the great empire they boast\r\nabout of drudges and whipped serfs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94On which the sun never rises, says Joe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94And the tragedy of it is, says the citizen, they believe it. The\r\nunfortunate yahoos believe it.\r\n\r\nThey believe in rod, the scourger almighty, creator of hell upon earth,\r\nand in Jacky Tar, the son of a gun, who was conceived of unholy boast,\r\nborn of the fighting navy, suffered under rump and dozen, was scarified,\r\nflayed and curried, yelled like bloody hell, the third day he arose\r\nagain from the bed, steered into haven, sitteth on his beamend till\r\nfurther orders whence he shall come to drudge for a living and be paid.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94But, says Bloom, isn\xe2\x80\x99t discipline the same everywhere. I mean wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nit be the same here if you put force against force?\r\n\r\nDidn\xe2\x80\x99t I tell you? As true as I\xe2\x80\x99m drinking this porter if he was at his\r\nlast gasp he\xe2\x80\x99d try to downface you that dying was living.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94We\xe2\x80\x99ll put force against force, says the citizen. We have our greater\r\nIreland beyond the sea. They were driven out of house and home in the\r\nblack 47. Their mudcabins and their shielings by the roadside were laid\r\nlow by the batteringram and the Times rubbed its hands and told the\r\nwhitelivered Saxons there would soon be as few Irish in Ireland as\r\nredskins in America. Even the Grand Turk sent us his piastres. But the\r\nSassenach tried to starve the nation at home while the land was full\r\nof crops that the British hyenas bought and sold in Rio de Janeiro. Ay,\r\nthey drove out the peasants in hordes. Twenty thousand of them died in\r\nthe coffinships. But those that came to the land of the free remember\r\nthe land of bondage. And they will come again and with a vengeance, no\r\ncravens, the sons of Granuaile, the champions of Kathleen ni Houlihan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Perfectly true, says Bloom. But my point was...\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94We are a long time waiting for that day, citizen, says Ned. Since the\r\npoor old woman told us that the French were on the sea and landed at\r\nKillala.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Ay, says John Wyse. We fought for the royal Stuarts that reneged us\r\nagainst the Williamites and they betrayed us. Remember Limerick and the\r\nbroken treatystone. We gave our best blood to France and Spain, the\r\nwild geese. Fontenoy, eh? And Sarsfield and O\xe2\x80\x99Donnell, duke of Tetuan\r\nin Spain, and Ulysses Browne of Camus that was fieldmarshal to Maria\r\nTeresa. But what did we ever get for it?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94The French! says the citizen. Set of dancing masters! Do you know what\r\nit is? They were never worth a roasted fart to Ireland. Aren\xe2\x80\x99t they\r\ntrying to make an Entente cordiale now at Tay Pay\xe2\x80\x99s dinnerparty with\r\nperfidious Albion? Firebrands of Europe and they always were.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Conspuez les Fran\xc3\xa7ais, says Lenehan, nobbling his beer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94And as for the Prooshians and the Hanoverians, says Joe, haven\xe2\x80\x99t we\r\nhad enough of those sausageeating bastards on the throne from George the\r\nelector down to the German lad and the flatulent old bitch that\xe2\x80\x99s dead?\r\n\r\nJesus, I had to laugh at the way he came out with that about the old one\r\nwith the winkers on her, blind drunk in her royal palace every night of\r\nGod, old Vic, with her jorum of mountain dew and her coachman carting\r\nher up body and bones to roll into bed and she pulling him by the\r\nwhiskers and singing him old bits of songs about Ehren on the Rhine and\r\ncome where the boose is cheaper.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Well, says J. J. We have Edward the peacemaker now.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Tell that to a fool, says the citizen. There\xe2\x80\x99s a bloody sight more pox\r\nthan pax about that boyo. Edward Guelph-Wettin!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94And what do you think, says Joe, of the holy boys, the priests\r\nand bishops of Ireland doing up his room in Maynooth in His Satanic\r\nMajesty\xe2\x80\x99s racing colours and sticking up pictures of all the horses his\r\njockeys rode. The earl of Dublin, no less.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94They ought to have stuck up all the women he rode himself, says little\r\nAlf.\r\n\r\nAnd says J. J.:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Considerations of space influenced their lordships\xe2\x80\x99 decision.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Will you try another, citizen? says Joe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Yes, sir, says he. I will.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94You? says Joe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Beholden to you, Joe, says I. May your shadow never grow less.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Repeat that dose, says Joe.\r\n\r\nBloom was talking and talking with John Wyse and he quite excited with\r\nhis dunducketymudcoloured mug on him and his old plumeyes rolling about.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Persecution, says he, all the history of the world is full of it.\r\nPerpetuating national hatred among nations.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94But do you know what a nation means? says John Wyse.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Yes, says Bloom.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94What is it? says John Wyse.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94A nation? says Bloom. A nation is the same people living in the same\r\nplace.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94By God, then, says Ned, laughing, if that\xe2\x80\x99s so I\xe2\x80\x99m a nation for I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nliving in the same place for the past five years.\r\n\r\nSo of course everyone had the laugh at Bloom and says he, trying to muck\r\nout of it:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Or also living in different places.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94That covers my case, says Joe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94What is your nation if I may ask? says the citizen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Ireland, says Bloom. I was born here. Ireland.\r\n\r\nThe citizen said nothing only cleared the spit out of his gullet and,\r\ngob, he spat a Red bank oyster out of him right in the corner.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94After you with the push, Joe, says he, taking out his handkerchief to\r\nswab himself dry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Here you are, citizen, says Joe. Take that in your right hand and\r\nrepeat after me the following words.\r\n\r\nThe muchtreasured and intricately embroidered ancient Irish facecloth\r\nattributed to Solomon of Droma and Manus Tomaltach og MacDonogh, authors\r\nof the Book of Ballymote, was then carefully produced and called forth\r\nprolonged admiration. No need to dwell on the legendary beauty of the\r\ncornerpieces, the acme of art, wherein one can distinctly discern each\r\nof the four evangelists in turn presenting to each of the four masters\r\nhis evangelical symbol, a bogoak sceptre, a North American puma (a far\r\nnobler king of beasts than the British article, be it said in passing),\r\na Kerry calf and a golden eagle from Carrantuohill. The scenes depicted\r\non the emunctory field, showing our ancient duns and raths and cromlechs\r\nand grianauns and seats of learning and maledictive stones, are as\r\nwonderfully beautiful and the pigments as delicate as when the Sligo\r\nilluminators gave free rein to their artistic fantasy long long ago in\r\nthe time of the Barmecides. Glendalough, the lovely lakes of Killarney,\r\nthe ruins of Clonmacnois, Cong Abbey, Glen Inagh and the Twelve Pins,\r\nIreland\xe2\x80\x99s Eye, the Green Hills of Tallaght, Croagh Patrick, the brewery\r\nof Messrs Arthur Guinness, Son and Company (Limited), Lough Neagh\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbanks, the vale of Ovoca, Isolde\xe2\x80\x99s tower, the Mapas obelisk, Sir Patrick\r\nDun\xe2\x80\x99s hospital, Cape Clear, the glen of Aherlow, Lynch\xe2\x80\x99s castle, the\r\nScotch house, Rathdown Union Workhouse at Loughlinstown, Tullamore jail,\r\nCastleconnel rapids, Kilballymacshonakill, the cross at Monasterboice,\r\nJury\xe2\x80\x99s Hotel, S. Patrick\xe2\x80\x99s Purgatory, the Salmon Leap, Maynooth college\r\nrefectory, Curley\xe2\x80\x99s hole, the three birthplaces of the first duke of\r\nWellington, the rock of Cashel, the bog of Allen, the Henry Street\r\nWarehouse, Fingal\xe2\x80\x99s Cave\xe2\x80\x94all these moving scenes are still there for us\r\ntoday rendered more beautiful still by the waters of sorrow which have\r\npassed over them and by the rich incrustations of time.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Show us over the drink, says I. Which is which?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94That\xe2\x80\x99s mine, says Joe, as the devil said to the dead policeman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94And I belong to a race too, says Bloom, that is hated and persecuted.\r\nAlso now. This very moment. This very instant.\r\n\r\nGob, he near burnt his fingers with the butt of his old cigar.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Robbed, says he. Plundered. Insulted. Persecuted. Taking what belongs\r\nto us by right. At this very moment, says he, putting up his fist, sold\r\nby auction in Morocco like slaves or cattle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Are you talking about the new Jerusalem? says the citizen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99m talking about injustice, says Bloom.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Right, says John Wyse. Stand up to it then with force like men.\r\n\r\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s an almanac picture for you. Mark for a softnosed bullet. Old\r\nlardyface standing up to the business end of a gun. Gob, he\xe2\x80\x99d adorn a\r\nsweepingbrush, so he would, if he only had a nurse\xe2\x80\x99s apron on him. And\r\nthen he collapses all of a sudden, twisting around all the opposite, as\r\nlimp as a wet rag.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94But it\xe2\x80\x99s no use, says he. Force, hatred, history, all that. That\xe2\x80\x99s not\r\nlife for men and women, insult and hatred. And everybody knows that it\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nthe very opposite of that that is really life.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94What? says Alf.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Love, says Bloom. I mean the opposite of hatred. I must go now, says\r\nhe to John Wyse. Just round to the court a moment to see if Martin is\r\nthere. If he comes just say I\xe2\x80\x99ll be back in a second. Just a moment.\r\n\r\nWho\xe2\x80\x99s hindering you? And off he pops like greased lightning.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94A new apostle to the gentiles, says the citizen. Universal love.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Well, says John Wyse. Isn\xe2\x80\x99t that what we\xe2\x80\x99re told. Love your neighbour.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94That chap? says the citizen. Beggar my neighbour is his motto. Love,\r\nmoya! He\xe2\x80\x99s a nice pattern of a Romeo and Juliet.\r\n\r\nLove loves to love love. Nurse loves the new chemist. Constable 14A\r\nloves Mary Kelly. Gerty MacDowell loves the boy that has the bicycle. M.\r\nB. loves a fair gentleman. Li Chi Han lovey up kissy Cha Pu Chow. Jumbo,\r\nthe elephant, loves Alice, the elephant. Old Mr Verschoyle with the ear\r\ntrumpet loves old Mrs Verschoyle with the turnedin eye. The man in the\r\nbrown macintosh loves a lady who is dead. His Majesty the King loves Her\r\nMajesty the Queen. Mrs Norman W. Tupper loves officer Taylor. You love\r\na certain person. And this person loves that other person because\r\neverybody loves somebody but God loves everybody.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Well, Joe, says I, your very good health and song. More power, citizen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Hurrah, there, says Joe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94The blessing of God and Mary and Patrick on you, says the citizen.\r\n\r\nAnd he ups with his pint to wet his whistle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94We know those canters, says he, preaching and picking your pocket. What\r\nabout sanctimonious Cromwell and his ironsides that put the women and\r\nchildren of Drogheda to the sword with the bible text God is love pasted\r\nround the mouth of his cannon? The bible! Did you read that skit in the\r\nUnited Irishman today about that Zulu chief that\xe2\x80\x99s visiting England?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94What\xe2\x80\x99s that? says Joe.\r\n\r\nSo the citizen takes up one of his paraphernalia papers and he starts\r\nreading out:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94A delegation of the chief cotton magnates of Manchester was presented\r\nyesterday to His Majesty the Alaki of Abeakuta by Gold Stick in Waiting,\r\nLord Walkup of Walkup on Eggs, to tender to His Majesty the heartfelt\r\nthanks of British traders for the facilities afforded them in his\r\ndominions. The delegation partook of luncheon at the conclusion of which\r\nthe dusky potentate, in the course of a happy speech, freely translated\r\nby the British chaplain, the reverend Ananias Praisegod Barebones,\r\ntendered his best thanks to Massa Walkup and emphasised the cordial\r\nrelations existing between Abeakuta and the British empire, stating that\r\nhe treasured as one of his dearest possessions an illuminated bible,\r\nthe volume of the word of God and the secret of England\xe2\x80\x99s greatness,\r\ngraciously presented to him by the white chief woman, the great squaw\r\nVictoria, with a personal dedication from the august hand of the Royal\r\nDonor. The Alaki then drank a lovingcup of firstshot usquebaugh to the\r\ntoast Black and White from the skull of his immediate predecessor in the\r\ndynasty Kakachakachak, surnamed Forty Warts, after which he visited the\r\nchief factory of Cottonopolis and signed his mark in the visitors\xe2\x80\x99 book,\r\nsubsequently executing a charming old Abeakutic wardance, in the course\r\nof which he swallowed several knives and forks, amid hilarious applause\r\nfrom the girl hands.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Widow woman, says Ned. I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t doubt her. Wonder did he put that\r\nbible to the same use as I would.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Same only more so, says Lenehan. And thereafter in that fruitful land\r\nthe broadleaved mango flourished exceedingly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Is that by Griffith? says John Wyse.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94No, says the citizen. It\xe2\x80\x99s not signed Shanganagh. It\xe2\x80\x99s only initialled:\r\nP.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94And a very good initial too, says Joe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94That\xe2\x80\x99s how it\xe2\x80\x99s worked, says the citizen. Trade follows the flag.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Well, says J. J., if they\xe2\x80\x99re any worse than those Belgians in the Congo\r\nFree State they must be bad. Did you read that report by a man what\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nthis his name is?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Casement, says the citizen. He\xe2\x80\x99s an Irishman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Yes, that\xe2\x80\x99s the man, says J. J. Raping the women and girls and flogging\r\nthe natives on the belly to squeeze all the red rubber they can out of\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I know where he\xe2\x80\x99s gone, says Lenehan, cracking his fingers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Who? says I.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Bloom, says he. The courthouse is a blind. He had a few bob on\r\nThrowaway and he\xe2\x80\x99s gone to gather in the shekels.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Is it that whiteeyed kaffir? says the citizen, that never backed a\r\nhorse in anger in his life?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94That\xe2\x80\x99s where he\xe2\x80\x99s gone, says Lenehan. I met Bantam Lyons going to back\r\nthat horse only I put him off it and he told me Bloom gave him the tip.\r\nBet you what you like he has a hundred shillings to five on. He\xe2\x80\x99s the\r\nonly man in Dublin has it. A dark horse.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94He\xe2\x80\x99s a bloody dark horse himself, says Joe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Mind, Joe, says I. Show us the entrance out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94There you are, says Terry.\r\n\r\nGoodbye Ireland I\xe2\x80\x99m going to Gort. So I just went round the back of\r\nthe yard to pumpship and begob (hundred shillings to five) while I was\r\nletting off my (Throwaway twenty to) letting off my load gob says I\r\nto myself I knew he was uneasy in his (two pints off of Joe and one in\r\nSlattery\xe2\x80\x99s off) in his mind to get off the mark to (hundred shillings\r\nis five quid) and when they were in the (dark horse) pisser Burke was\r\ntelling me card party and letting on the child was sick (gob, must have\r\ndone about a gallon) flabbyarse of a wife speaking down the tube she\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbetter or she\xe2\x80\x99s (ow!) all a plan so he could vamoose with the pool if he\r\nwon or (Jesus, full up I was) trading without a licence (ow!) Ireland my\r\nnation says he (hoik! phthook!) never be up to those bloody (there\xe2\x80\x99s the\r\nlast of it) Jerusalem (ah!) cuckoos.\r\n\r\nSo anyhow when I got back they were at it dingdong, John Wyse saying it\r\nwas Bloom gave the ideas for Sinn Fein to Griffith to put in his paper\r\nall kinds of jerrymandering, packed juries and swindling the taxes off\r\nof the government and appointing consuls all over the world to walk\r\nabout selling Irish industries. Robbing Peter to pay Paul. Gob, that\r\nputs the bloody kybosh on it if old sloppy eyes is mucking up the show.\r\nGive us a bloody chance. God save Ireland from the likes of that bloody\r\nmouseabout. Mr Bloom with his argol bargol. And his old fellow before\r\nhim perpetrating frauds, old Methusalem Bloom, the robbing bagman, that\r\npoisoned himself with the prussic acid after he swamping the country\r\nwith his baubles and his penny diamonds. Loans by post on easy terms.\r\nAny amount of money advanced on note of hand. Distance no object. No\r\nsecurity. Gob, he\xe2\x80\x99s like Lanty MacHale\xe2\x80\x99s goat that\xe2\x80\x99d go a piece of the\r\nroad with every one.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s a fact, says John Wyse. And there\xe2\x80\x99s the man now that\xe2\x80\x99ll tell\r\nyou all about it, Martin Cunningham.\r\n\r\nSure enough the castle car drove up with Martin on it and Jack Power\r\nwith him and a fellow named Crofter or Crofton, pensioner out of\r\nthe collector general\xe2\x80\x99s, an orangeman Blackburn does have on the\r\nregistration and he drawing his pay or Crawford gallivanting around the\r\ncountry at the king\xe2\x80\x99s expense.\r\n\r\nOur travellers reached the rustic hostelry and alighted from their\r\npalfreys.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Ho, varlet! cried he, who by his mien seemed the leader of the party.\r\nSaucy knave! To us!\r\n\r\nSo saying he knocked loudly with his swordhilt upon the open lattice.\r\n\r\nMine host came forth at the summons, girding him with his tabard.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Give you good den, my masters, said he with an obsequious bow.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Bestir thyself, sirrah! cried he who had knocked. Look to our steeds.\r\nAnd for ourselves give us of your best for ifaith we need it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Lackaday, good masters, said the host, my poor house has but a bare\r\nlarder. I know not what to offer your lordships.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94How now, fellow? cried the second of the party, a man of pleasant\r\ncountenance, So servest thou the king\xe2\x80\x99s messengers, master Taptun?\r\n\r\nAn instantaneous change overspread the landlord\xe2\x80\x99s visage.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Cry you mercy, gentlemen, he said humbly. An you be the king\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmessengers (God shield His Majesty!) you shall not want for aught. The\r\nking\xe2\x80\x99s friends (God bless His Majesty!) shall not go afasting in my\r\nhouse I warrant me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Then about! cried the traveller who had not spoken, a lusty trencherman\r\nby his aspect. Hast aught to give us?\r\n\r\nMine host bowed again as he made answer:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94What say you, good masters, to a squab pigeon pasty, some collops of\r\nvenison, a saddle of veal, widgeon with crisp hog\xe2\x80\x99s bacon, a boar\xe2\x80\x99s head\r\nwith pistachios, a bason of jolly custard, a medlar tansy and a flagon\r\nof old Rhenish?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Gadzooks! cried the last speaker. That likes me well. Pistachios!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Aha! cried he of the pleasant countenance. A poor house and a bare\r\nlarder, quotha! \xe2\x80\x98Tis a merry rogue.\r\n\r\nSo in comes Martin asking where was Bloom.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Where is he? says Lenehan. Defrauding widows and orphans.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Isn\xe2\x80\x99t that a fact, says John Wyse, what I was telling the citizen about\r\nBloom and the Sinn Fein?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94That\xe2\x80\x99s so, says Martin. Or so they allege.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Who made those allegations? says Alf.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I, says Joe. I\xe2\x80\x99m the alligator.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94And after all, says John Wyse, why can\xe2\x80\x99t a jew love his country like\r\nthe next fellow?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Why not? says J. J., when he\xe2\x80\x99s quite sure which country it is.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Is he a jew or a gentile or a holy Roman or a swaddler or what the hell\r\nis he? says Ned. Or who is he? No offence, Crofton.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Who is Junius? says J. J.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94We don\xe2\x80\x99t want him, says Crofter the Orangeman or presbyterian.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94He\xe2\x80\x99s a perverted jew, says Martin, from a place in Hungary and it was\r\nhe drew up all the plans according to the Hungarian system. We know that\r\nin the castle.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Isn\xe2\x80\x99t he a cousin of Bloom the dentist? says Jack Power.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Not at all, says Martin. Only namesakes. His name was Virag, the\r\nfather\xe2\x80\x99s name that poisoned himself. He changed it by deedpoll, the\r\nfather did.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94That\xe2\x80\x99s the new Messiah for Ireland! says the citizen. Island of saints\r\nand sages!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Well, they\xe2\x80\x99re still waiting for their redeemer, says Martin. For that\r\nmatter so are we.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Yes, says J. J., and every male that\xe2\x80\x99s born they think it may be their\r\nMessiah. And every jew is in a tall state of excitement, I believe, till\r\nhe knows if he\xe2\x80\x99s a father or a mother.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Expecting every moment will be his next, says Lenehan.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94O, by God, says Ned, you should have seen Bloom before that son of his\r\nthat died was born. I met him one day in the south city markets buying a\r\ntin of Neave\xe2\x80\x99s food six weeks before the wife was delivered.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94En ventre sa m\xc3\xa8re, says J. J.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Do you call that a man? says the citizen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I wonder did he ever put it out of sight, says Joe.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Well, there were two children born anyhow, says Jack Power.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94And who does he suspect? says the citizen.\r\n\r\nGob, there\xe2\x80\x99s many a true word spoken in jest. One of those mixed\r\nmiddlings he is. Lying up in the hotel Pisser was telling me once a\r\nmonth with headache like a totty with her courses. Do you know what I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\ntelling you? It\xe2\x80\x99d be an act of God to take a hold of a fellow the like\r\nof that and throw him in the bloody sea. Justifiable homicide, so it\r\nwould. Then sloping off with his five quid without putting up a pint of\r\nstuff like a man. Give us your blessing. Not as much as would blind your\r\neye.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Charity to the neighbour, says Martin. But where is he? We can\xe2\x80\x99t wait.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94A wolf in sheep\xe2\x80\x99s clothing, says the citizen. That\xe2\x80\x99s what he is. Virag\r\nfrom Hungary! Ahasuerus I call him. Cursed by God.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Have you time for a brief libation, Martin? says Ned.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Only one, says Martin. We must be quick. J. J. and S.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94You, Jack? Crofton? Three half ones, Terry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Saint Patrick would want to land again at Ballykinlar and convert us,\r\nsays the citizen, after allowing things like that to contaminate our\r\nshores.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Well, says Martin, rapping for his glass. God bless all here is my\r\nprayer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Amen, says the citizen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94And I\xe2\x80\x99m sure He will, says Joe.\r\n\r\nAnd at the sound of the sacring bell, headed by a crucifer with\r\nacolytes, thurifers, boatbearers, readers, ostiarii, deacons and\r\nsubdeacons, the blessed company drew nigh of mitred abbots and priors\r\nand guardians and monks and friars: the monks of Benedict of Spoleto,\r\nCarthusians and Camaldolesi, Cistercians and Olivetans, Oratorians\r\nand Vallombrosans, and the friars of Augustine, Brigittines,\r\nPremonstratensians, Servi, Trinitarians, and the children of Peter\r\nNolasco: and therewith from Carmel mount the children of Elijah prophet\r\nled by Albert bishop and by Teresa of Avila, calced and other: and\r\nfriars, brown and grey, sons of poor Francis, capuchins, cordeliers,\r\nminimes and observants and the daughters of Clara: and the sons of\r\nDominic, the friars preachers, and the sons of Vincent: and the monks\r\nof S. Wolstan: and Ignatius his children: and the confraternity of the\r\nchristian brothers led by the reverend brother Edmund Ignatius Rice. And\r\nafter came all saints and martyrs, virgins and confessors: S. Cyr and\r\nS. Isidore Arator and S. James the Less and S. Phocas of Sinope and S.\r\nJulian Hospitator and S. Felix de Cantalice and S. Simon Stylites and\r\nS. Stephen Protomartyr and S. John of God and S. Ferreol and S. Leugarde\r\nand S. Theodotus and S. Vulmar and S. Richard and S. Vincent de Paul and\r\nS. Martin of Todi and S. Martin of Tours and S. Alfred and S. Joseph and\r\nS. Denis and S. Cornelius and S. Leopold and S. Bernard and S. Terence\r\nand S. Edward and S. Owen Caniculus and S. Anonymous and S. Eponymous\r\nand S. Pseudonymous and S. Homonymous and S. Paronymous and S.\r\nSynonymous and S. Laurence O\xe2\x80\x99Toole and S. James of Dingle and\r\nCompostella and S. Columcille and S. Columba and S. Celestine and S.\r\nColman and S. Kevin and S. Brendan and S. Frigidian and S. Senan and S.\r\nFachtna and S. Columbanus and S. Gall and S. Fursey and S. Fintan and S.\r\nFiacre and S. John Nepomuc and S. Thomas Aquinas and S. Ives of Brittany\r\nand S. Michan and S. Herman-Joseph and the three patrons of holy youth\r\nS. Aloysius Gonzaga and S. Stanislaus Kostka and S. John Berchmans\r\nand the saints Gervasius, Servasius and Bonifacius and S. Bride and S.\r\nKieran and S. Canice of Kilkenny and S. Jarlath of Tuam and S. Finbarr\r\nand S. Pappin of Ballymun and Brother Aloysius Pacificus and Brother\r\nLouis Bellicosus and the saints Rose of Lima and of Viterbo and S.\r\nMartha of Bethany and S. Mary of Egypt and S. Lucy and S. Brigid and\r\nS. Attracta and S. Dympna and S. Ita and S. Marion Calpensis and\r\nthe Blessed Sister Teresa of the Child Jesus and S. Barbara and S.\r\nScholastica and S. Ursula with eleven thousand virgins. And all came\r\nwith nimbi and aureoles and gloriae, bearing palms and harps and swords\r\nand olive crowns, in robes whereon were woven the blessed symbols of\r\ntheir efficacies, inkhorns, arrows, loaves, cruses, fetters, axes,\r\ntrees, bridges, babes in a bathtub, shells, wallets, shears, keys,\r\ndragons, lilies, buckshot, beards, hogs, lamps, bellows, beehives,\r\nsoupladles, stars, snakes, anvils, boxes of vaseline, bells, crutches,\r\nforceps, stags\xe2\x80\x99 horns, watertight boots, hawks, millstones, eyes on a\r\ndish, wax candles, aspergills, unicorns. And as they wended their way by\r\nNelson\xe2\x80\x99s Pillar, Henry street, Mary street, Capel street, Little Britain\r\nstreet chanting the introit in Epiphania Domini which beginneth Surge,\r\nilluminare and thereafter most sweetly the gradual Omnes which saith de\r\nSaba venient they did divers wonders such as casting out devils, raising\r\nthe dead to life, multiplying fishes, healing the halt and the blind,\r\ndiscovering various articles which had been mislaid, interpreting and\r\nfulfilling the scriptures, blessing and prophesying. And last, beneath\r\na canopy of cloth of gold came the reverend Father O\xe2\x80\x99Flynn attended by\r\nMalachi and Patrick. And when the good fathers had reached the appointed\r\nplace, the house of Bernard Kiernan and Co, limited, 8, 9 and 10 little\r\nBritain street, wholesale grocers, wine and brandy shippers, licensed for\r\nthe sale of beer, wine and spirits for consumption on the premises, the\r\ncelebrant blessed the house and censed the mullioned windows and\r\nthe groynes and the vaults and the arrises and the capitals and the\r\npediments and the cornices and the engrailed arches and the spires and\r\nthe cupolas and sprinkled the lintels thereof with blessed water and\r\nprayed that God might bless that house as he had blessed the house of\r\nAbraham and Isaac and Jacob and make the angels of His light to inhabit\r\ntherein. And entering he blessed the viands and the beverages and the\r\ncompany of all the blessed answered his prayers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Adiutorium nostrum in nomine Domini.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Qui fecit c\xc5\x93lum et terram.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Dominus vobiscum.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Et cum spiritu tuo.\r\n\r\nAnd he laid his hands upon that he blessed and gave thanks and he prayed\r\nand they all with him prayed:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Deus, cuius verbo sanctificantur omnia, benedictionem tuam effunde\r\nsuper creaturas istas: et praesta ut quisquis eis secundum legem et\r\nvoluntatem Tuam cum gratiarum actione usus fuerit per invocationem\r\nsanctissimi nominis Tui corporis sanitatem et anim\xc3\xa6 tutelam Te auctore\r\npercipiat per Christum Dominum nostrum.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94And so say all of us, says Jack.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Thousand a year, Lambert, says Crofton or Crawford.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Right, says Ned, taking up his John Jameson. And butter for fish.\r\n\r\nI was just looking around to see who the happy thought would strike when\r\nbe damned but in he comes again letting on to be in a hell of a hurry.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I was just round at the courthouse, says he, looking for you. I hope\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m not...\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94No, says Martin, we\xe2\x80\x99re ready.\r\n\r\nCourthouse my eye and your pockets hanging down with gold and silver.\r\nMean bloody scut. Stand us a drink itself. Devil a sweet fear! There\xe2\x80\x99s\r\na jew for you! All for number one. Cute as a shithouse rat. Hundred to\r\nfive.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Don\xe2\x80\x99t tell anyone, says the citizen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Beg your pardon, says he.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Come on boys, says Martin, seeing it was looking blue. Come along now.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Don\xe2\x80\x99t tell anyone, says the citizen, letting a bawl out of him. It\xe2\x80\x99s a\r\nsecret.\r\n\r\nAnd the bloody dog woke up and let a growl.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Bye bye all, says Martin.\r\n\r\nAnd he got them out as quick as he could, Jack Power and Crofton or\r\nwhatever you call him and him in the middle of them letting on to be all\r\nat sea and up with them on the bloody jaunting car.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Off with you, says Martin to the jarvey.\r\n\r\nThe milkwhite dolphin tossed his mane and, rising in the golden poop the\r\nhelmsman spread the bellying sail upon the wind and stood off forward\r\nwith all sail set, the spinnaker to larboard. A many comely nymphs drew\r\nnigh to starboard and to larboard and, clinging to the sides of\r\nthe noble bark, they linked their shining forms as doth the cunning\r\nwheelwright when he fashions about the heart of his wheel the\r\nequidistant rays whereof each one is sister to another and he binds them\r\nall with an outer ring and giveth speed to the feet of men whenas they\r\nride to a hosting or contend for the smile of ladies fair. Even so did\r\nthey come and set them, those willing nymphs, the undying sisters. And\r\nthey laughed, sporting in a circle of their foam: and the bark clave the\r\nwaves.\r\n\r\nBut begob I was just lowering the heel of the pint when I saw the\r\ncitizen getting up to waddle to the door, puffing and blowing with the\r\ndropsy, and he cursing the curse of Cromwell on him, bell, book and\r\ncandle in Irish, spitting and spatting out of him and Joe and little Alf\r\nround him like a leprechaun trying to peacify him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Let me alone, says he.\r\n\r\nAnd begob he got as far as the door and they holding him and he bawls\r\nout of him:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Three cheers for Israel!\r\n\r\nArrah, sit down on the parliamentary side of your arse for Christ\xe2\x80\x99 sake\r\nand don\xe2\x80\x99t be making a public exhibition of yourself. Jesus, there\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nalways some bloody clown or other kicking up a bloody murder about\r\nbloody nothing. Gob, it\xe2\x80\x99d turn the porter sour in your guts, so it\r\nwould.\r\n\r\nAnd all the ragamuffins and sluts of the nation round the door and\r\nMartin telling the jarvey to drive ahead and the citizen bawling and Alf\r\nand Joe at him to whisht and he on his high horse about the jews and\r\nthe loafers calling for a speech and Jack Power trying to get him to sit\r\ndown on the car and hold his bloody jaw and a loafer with a patch over\r\nhis eye starts singing If the man in the moon was a jew, jew, jew and a\r\nslut shouts out of her:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Eh, mister! Your fly is open, mister!\r\n\r\nAnd says he:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Mendelssohn was a jew and Karl Marx and Mercadante and Spinoza. And the\r\nSaviour was a jew and his father was a jew. Your God.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94He had no father, says Martin. That\xe2\x80\x99ll do now. Drive ahead.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Whose God? says the citizen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Well, his uncle was a jew, says he. Your God was a jew. Christ was a\r\njew like me.\r\n\r\nGob, the citizen made a plunge back into the shop.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94By Jesus, says he, I\xe2\x80\x99ll brain that bloody jewman for using the holy\r\nname.\r\n\r\nBy Jesus, I\xe2\x80\x99ll crucify him so I will. Give us that biscuitbox here.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Stop! Stop! says Joe.\r\n\r\nA large and appreciative gathering of friends and acquaintances from\r\nthe metropolis and greater Dublin assembled in their thousands to bid\r\nfarewell to Nagyas\xc3\xa1gos uram Lip\xc3\xb3ti Virag, late of Messrs Alexander\r\nThom\xe2\x80\x99s, printers to His Majesty, on the occasion of his departure\r\nfor the distant clime of Sz\xc3\xa1zharminczbroj\xc3\xbaguly\xc3\xa1s-Dugul\xc3\xa1s (Meadow of\r\nMurmuring Waters). The ceremony which went off with great \xc3\xa9clat was\r\ncharacterised by the most affecting cordiality. An illuminated scroll\r\nof ancient Irish vellum, the work of Irish artists, was presented to\r\nthe distinguished phenomenologist on behalf of a large section of the\r\ncommunity and was accompanied by the gift of a silver casket, tastefully\r\nexecuted in the style of ancient Celtic ornament, a work which reflects\r\nevery credit on the makers, Messrs Jacob agus Jacob. The departing guest\r\nwas the recipient of a hearty ovation, many of those who were present\r\nbeing visibly moved when the select orchestra of Irish pipes struck\r\nup the wellknown strains of Come Back to Erin, followed immediately\r\nby Rak\xc3\xb3czsy\xe2\x80\x99s March. Tarbarrels and bonfires were lighted along the\r\ncoastline of the four seas on the summits of the Hill of Howth, Three\r\nRock Mountain, Sugarloaf, Bray Head, the mountains of Mourne, the\r\nGaltees, the Ox and Donegal and Sperrin peaks, the Nagles and the\r\nBograghs, the Connemara hills, the reeks of M\xe2\x80\x99Gillicuddy, Slieve Aughty,\r\nSlieve Bernagh and Slieve Bloom. Amid cheers that rent the welkin,\r\nresponded to by answering cheers from a big muster of henchmen on the\r\ndistant Cambrian and Caledonian hills, the mastodontic pleasureship\r\nslowly moved away saluted by a final floral tribute from the\r\nrepresentatives of the fair sex who were present in large numbers while,\r\nas it proceeded down the river, escorted by a flotilla of barges, the\r\nflags of the Ballast office and Custom House were dipped in salute as\r\nwere also those of the electrical power station at the Pigeonhouse and\r\nthe Poolbeg Light. Visszontl\xc3\xa1t\xc3\xa1sra, kedv\xc3\xa9s bar\xc3\xa1tom! Visszontl\xc3\xa1t\xc3\xa1sra!\r\nGone but not forgotten.\r\n\r\nGob, the devil wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t stop him till he got hold of the bloody tin\r\nanyhow and out with him and little Alf hanging on to his elbow and he\r\nshouting like a stuck pig, as good as any bloody play in the Queen\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nroyal theatre:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Where is he till I murder him?\r\n\r\nAnd Ned and J. J. paralysed with the laughing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Bloody wars, says I, I\xe2\x80\x99ll be in for the last gospel.\r\n\r\nBut as luck would have it the jarvey got the nag\xe2\x80\x99s head round the other\r\nway and off with him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Hold on, citizen, says Joe. Stop!\r\n\r\nBegob he drew his hand and made a swipe and let fly. Mercy of God the\r\nsun was in his eyes or he\xe2\x80\x99d have left him for dead. Gob, he near sent it\r\ninto the county Longford. The bloody nag took fright and the old\r\nmongrel after the car like bloody hell and all the populace shouting and\r\nlaughing and the old tinbox clattering along the street.\r\n\r\nThe catastrophe was terrific and instantaneous in its effect. The\r\nobservatory of Dunsink registered in all eleven shocks, all of the fifth\r\ngrade of Mercalli\xe2\x80\x99s scale, and there is no record extant of a similar\r\nseismic disturbance in our island since the earthquake of 1534, the year\r\nof the rebellion of Silken Thomas. The epicentre appears to have been\r\nthat part of the metropolis which constitutes the Inn\xe2\x80\x99s Quay ward and\r\nparish of Saint Michan covering a surface of fortyone acres, two roods\r\nand one square pole or perch. All the lordly residences in the vicinity\r\nof the palace of justice were demolished and that noble edifice itself,\r\nin which at the time of the catastrophe important legal debates were in\r\nprogress, is literally a mass of ruins beneath which it is to be\r\nfeared all the occupants have been buried alive. From the reports of\r\neyewitnesses it transpires that the seismic waves were accompanied by\r\na violent atmospheric perturbation of cyclonic character. An article of\r\nheadgear since ascertained to belong to the much respected clerk of the\r\ncrown and peace Mr George Fottrell and a silk umbrella with gold handle\r\nwith the engraved initials, crest, coat of arms and house number of\r\nthe erudite and worshipful chairman of quarter sessions sir Frederick\r\nFalkiner, recorder of Dublin, have been discovered by search parties\r\nin remote parts of the island respectively, the former on the third\r\nbasaltic ridge of the giant\xe2\x80\x99s causeway, the latter embedded to the\r\nextent of one foot three inches in the sandy beach of Holeopen bay near\r\nthe old head of Kinsale. Other eyewitnesses depose that they observed\r\nan incandescent object of enormous proportions hurtling through the\r\natmosphere at a terrifying velocity in a trajectory directed southwest\r\nby west. Messages of condolence and sympathy are being hourly received\r\nfrom all parts of the different continents and the sovereign pontiff\r\nhas been graciously pleased to decree that a special missa pro defunctis\r\nshall be celebrated simultaneously by the ordinaries of each and every\r\ncathedral church of all the episcopal dioceses subject to the spiritual\r\nauthority of the Holy See in suffrage of the souls of those faithful\r\ndeparted who have been so unexpectedly called away from our midst. The\r\nwork of salvage, removal of d\xc3\xa9bris, human remains etc has been entrusted\r\nto Messrs Michael Meade and Son, 159 Great Brunswick street, and Messrs\r\nT. and C. Martin, 77, 78, 79 and 80 North Wall, assisted by the men\r\nand officers of the Duke of Cornwall\xe2\x80\x99s light infantry under the general\r\nsupervision of H. R. H., rear admiral, the right honourable sir Hercules\r\nHannibal Habeas Corpus Anderson, K. G., K. P., K. T., P. C., K. C. B.,\r\nM. P., J. P., M. B., D. S. O., S. O. D., M. F. H., M. R. I. A., B. L.,\r\nMus. Doc., P. L. G., F. T. C. D., F. R. U. I., F. R. C. P. I. and F. R.\r\nC. S. I.\r\n\r\nYou never saw the like of it in all your born puff. Gob, if he got that\r\nlottery ticket on the side of his poll he\xe2\x80\x99d remember the gold cup, he\r\nwould so, but begob the citizen would have been lagged for assault and\r\nbattery and Joe for aiding and abetting. The jarvey saved his life by\r\nfurious driving as sure as God made Moses. What? O, Jesus, he did. And\r\nhe let a volley of oaths after him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Did I kill him, says he, or what?\r\n\r\nAnd he shouting to the bloody dog:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94After him, Garry! After him, boy!\r\n\r\nAnd the last we saw was the bloody car rounding the corner and old\r\nsheepsface on it gesticulating and the bloody mongrel after it with his\r\nlugs back for all he was bloody well worth to tear him limb from limb.\r\nHundred to five! Jesus, he took the value of it out of him, I promise\r\nyou.\r\n\r\nWhen, lo, there came about them all a great brightness and they beheld\r\nthe chariot wherein He stood ascend to heaven. And they beheld Him in\r\nthe chariot, clothed upon in the glory of the brightness, having raiment\r\nas of the sun, fair as the moon and terrible that for awe they durst not\r\nlook upon Him. And there came a voice out of heaven, calling: Elijah!\r\nElijah! And He answered with a main cry: Abba! Adonai! And they beheld\r\nHim even Him, ben Bloom Elijah, amid clouds of angels ascend to the\r\nglory of the brightness at an angle of fortyfive degrees over Donohoe\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nin Little Green street like a shot off a shovel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[ 13 ]\r\n\r\nThe summer evening had begun to fold the world in its mysterious\r\nembrace. Far away in the west the sun was setting and the last glow of\r\nall too fleeting day lingered lovingly on sea and strand, on the proud\r\npromontory of dear old Howth guarding as ever the waters of the bay, on\r\nthe weedgrown rocks along Sandymount shore and, last but not least, on\r\nthe quiet church whence there streamed forth at times upon the stillness\r\nthe voice of prayer to her who is in her pure radiance a beacon ever to\r\nthe stormtossed heart of man, Mary, star of the sea.\r\n\r\nThe three girl friends were seated on the rocks, enjoying the evening\r\nscene and the air which was fresh but not too chilly. Many a time and\r\noft were they wont to come there to that favourite nook to have a cosy\r\nchat beside the sparkling waves and discuss matters feminine, Cissy\r\nCaffrey and Edy Boardman with the baby in the pushcar and Tommy and\r\nJacky Caffrey, two little curlyheaded boys, dressed in sailor suits with\r\ncaps to match and the name H. M. S. Belleisle printed on both. For Tommy\r\nand Jacky Caffrey were twins, scarce four years old and very noisy and\r\nspoiled twins sometimes but for all that darling little fellows with\r\nbright merry faces and endearing ways about them. They were dabbling in\r\nthe sand with their spades and buckets, building castles as children do,\r\nor playing with their big coloured ball, happy as the day was long. And\r\nEdy Boardman was rocking the chubby baby to and fro in the pushcar while\r\nthat young gentleman fairly chuckled with delight. He was but eleven\r\nmonths and nine days old and, though still a tiny toddler, was just\r\nbeginning to lisp his first babyish words. Cissy Caffrey bent over to\r\nhim to tease his fat little plucks and the dainty dimple in his chin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Now, baby, Cissy Caffrey said. Say out big, big. I want a drink of\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nAnd baby prattled after her:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94A jink a jink a jawbo.\r\n\r\nCissy Caffrey cuddled the wee chap for she was awfully fond of children,\r\nso patient with little sufferers and Tommy Caffrey could never be got to\r\ntake his castor oil unless it was Cissy Caffrey that held his nose and\r\npromised him the scatty heel of the loaf or brown bread with golden\r\nsyrup on. What a persuasive power that girl had! But to be sure baby\r\nBoardman was as good as gold, a perfect little dote in his new fancy\r\nbib. None of your spoilt beauties, Flora MacFlimsy sort, was Cissy\r\nCaffrey. A truerhearted lass never drew the breath of life, always with\r\na laugh in her gipsylike eyes and a frolicsome word on her cherryripe\r\nred lips, a girl lovable in the extreme. And Edy Boardman laughed too at\r\nthe quaint language of little brother.\r\n\r\nBut just then there was a slight altercation between Master Tommy and\r\nMaster Jacky. Boys will be boys and our two twins were no exception\r\nto this golden rule. The apple of discord was a certain castle of sand\r\nwhich Master Jacky had built and Master Tommy would have it right go\r\nwrong that it was to be architecturally improved by a frontdoor like the\r\nMartello tower had. But if Master Tommy was headstrong Master Jacky was\r\nselfwilled too and, true to the maxim that every little Irishman\xe2\x80\x99s house\r\nis his castle, he fell upon his hated rival and to such purpose that the\r\nwouldbe assailant came to grief and (alas to relate!) the coveted castle\r\ntoo. Needless to say the cries of discomfited Master Tommy drew the\r\nattention of the girl friends.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Come here, Tommy, his sister called imperatively. At once! And you,\r\nJacky, for shame to throw poor Tommy in the dirty sand. Wait till I\r\ncatch you for that.\r\n\r\nHis eyes misty with unshed tears Master Tommy came at her call for their\r\nbig sister\xe2\x80\x99s word was law with the twins. And in a sad plight he was\r\ntoo after his misadventure. His little man-o\xe2\x80\x99-war top and unmentionables\r\nwere full of sand but Cissy was a past mistress in the art of smoothing\r\nover life\xe2\x80\x99s tiny troubles and very quickly not one speck of sand was to\r\nbe seen on his smart little suit. Still the blue eyes were glistening\r\nwith hot tears that would well up so she kissed away the hurtness and\r\nshook her hand at Master Jacky the culprit and said if she was near him\r\nshe wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be far from him, her eyes dancing in admonition.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Nasty bold Jacky! she cried.\r\n\r\nShe put an arm round the little mariner and coaxed winningly:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94What\xe2\x80\x99s your name? Butter and cream?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Tell us who is your sweetheart, spoke Edy Boardman. Is Cissy your\r\nsweetheart?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Nao, tearful Tommy said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Is Edy Boardman your sweetheart? Cissy queried.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Nao, Tommy said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I know, Edy Boardman said none too amiably with an arch glance from her\r\nshortsighted eyes. I know who is Tommy\xe2\x80\x99s sweetheart. Gerty is Tommy\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsweetheart.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Nao, Tommy said on the verge of tears.\r\n\r\nCissy\xe2\x80\x99s quick motherwit guessed what was amiss and she whispered to\r\nEdy Boardman to take him there behind the pushcar where the gentleman\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t see and to mind he didn\xe2\x80\x99t wet his new tan shoes.\r\n\r\nBut who was Gerty?\r\n\r\nGerty MacDowell who was seated near her companions, lost in thought,\r\ngazing far away into the distance was, in very truth, as fair a specimen\r\nof winsome Irish girlhood as one could wish to see. She was pronounced\r\nbeautiful by all who knew her though, as folks often said, she was\r\nmore a Giltrap than a MacDowell. Her figure was slight and graceful,\r\ninclining even to fragility but those iron jelloids she had been taking\r\nof late had done her a world of good much better than the Widow Welch\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfemale pills and she was much better of those discharges she used to\r\nget and that tired feeling. The waxen pallor of her face was almost\r\nspiritual in its ivorylike purity though her rosebud mouth was a genuine\r\nCupid\xe2\x80\x99s bow, Greekly perfect. Her hands were of finely veined alabaster\r\nwith tapering fingers and as white as lemonjuice and queen of ointments\r\ncould make them though it was not true that she used to wear kid gloves\r\nin bed or take a milk footbath either. Bertha Supple told that once to\r\nEdy Boardman, a deliberate lie, when she was black out at daggers drawn\r\nwith Gerty (the girl chums had of course their little tiffs from time to\r\ntime like the rest of mortals) and she told her not to let on whatever\r\nshe did that it was her that told her or she\xe2\x80\x99d never speak to her\r\nagain. No. Honour where honour is due. There was an innate refinement, a\r\nlanguid queenly hauteur about Gerty which was unmistakably evidenced in\r\nher delicate hands and higharched instep. Had kind fate but willed her\r\nto be born a gentlewoman of high degree in her own right and had she\r\nonly received the benefit of a good education Gerty MacDowell might\r\neasily have held her own beside any lady in the land and have seen\r\nherself exquisitely gowned with jewels on her brow and patrician suitors\r\nat her feet vying with one another to pay their devoirs to her.\r\nMayhap it was this, the love that might have been, that lent to her\r\nsoftlyfeatured face at whiles a look, tense with suppressed meaning,\r\nthat imparted a strange yearning tendency to the beautiful eyes, a charm\r\nfew could resist. Why have women such eyes of witchery? Gerty\xe2\x80\x99s were of\r\nthe bluest Irish blue, set off by lustrous lashes and dark expressive\r\nbrows. Time was when those brows were not so silkily seductive. It\r\nwas Madame Vera Verity, directress of the Woman Beautiful page of the\r\nPrincess Novelette, who had first advised her to try eyebrowleine which\r\ngave that haunting expression to the eyes, so becoming in leaders\r\nof fashion, and she had never regretted it. Then there was blushing\r\nscientifically cured and how to be tall increase your height and you\r\nhave a beautiful face but your nose? That would suit Mrs Dignam because\r\nshe had a button one. But Gerty\xe2\x80\x99s crowning glory was her wealth of\r\nwonderful hair. It was dark brown with a natural wave in it. She had cut\r\nit that very morning on account of the new moon and it nestled about\r\nher pretty head in a profusion of luxuriant clusters and pared her nails\r\ntoo, Thursday for wealth. And just now at Edy\xe2\x80\x99s words as a telltale\r\nflush, delicate as the faintest rosebloom, crept into her cheeks she\r\nlooked so lovely in her sweet girlish shyness that of a surety God\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfair land of Ireland did not hold her equal.\r\n\r\nFor an instant she was silent with rather sad downcast eyes. She\r\nwas about to retort but something checked the words on her tongue.\r\nInclination prompted her to speak out: dignity told her to be silent.\r\nThe pretty lips pouted awhile but then she glanced up and broke out into\r\na joyous little laugh which had in it all the freshness of a young May\r\nmorning. She knew right well, no-one better, what made squinty Edy\r\nsay that because of him cooling in his attentions when it was simply a\r\nlovers\xe2\x80\x99 quarrel. As per usual somebody\xe2\x80\x99s nose was out of joint about the\r\nboy that had the bicycle off the London bridge road always riding up\r\nand down in front of her window. Only now his father kept him in in the\r\nevenings studying hard to get an exhibition in the intermediate that was\r\non and he was going to go to Trinity college to study for a doctor when\r\nhe left the high school like his brother W. E. Wylie who was racing\r\nin the bicycle races in Trinity college university. Little recked he\r\nperhaps for what she felt, that dull aching void in her heart sometimes,\r\npiercing to the core. Yet he was young and perchance he might learn\r\nto love her in time. They were protestants in his family and of course\r\nGerty knew Who came first and after Him the Blessed Virgin and then\r\nSaint Joseph. But he was undeniably handsome with an exquisite nose and\r\nhe was what he looked, every inch a gentleman, the shape of his head too\r\nat the back without his cap on that she would know anywhere something\r\noff the common and the way he turned the bicycle at the lamp with his\r\nhands off the bars and also the nice perfume of those good cigarettes\r\nand besides they were both of a size too he and she and that was why Edy\r\nBoardman thought she was so frightfully clever because he didn\xe2\x80\x99t go and\r\nride up and down in front of her bit of a garden.\r\n\r\nGerty was dressed simply but with the instinctive taste of a votary of\r\nDame Fashion for she felt that there was just a might that he might be\r\nout. A neat blouse of electric blue selftinted by dolly dyes (because it\r\nwas expected in the Lady\xe2\x80\x99s Pictorial that electric blue would be worn)\r\nwith a smart vee opening down to the division and kerchief pocket (in\r\nwhich she always kept a piece of cottonwool scented with her\r\nfavourite perfume because the handkerchief spoiled the sit) and a navy\r\nthreequarter skirt cut to the stride showed off her slim graceful figure\r\nto perfection. She wore a coquettish little love of a hat of wideleaved\r\nnigger straw contrast trimmed with an underbrim of eggblue chenille and\r\nat the side a butterfly bow of silk to tone. All Tuesday week afternoon\r\nshe was hunting to match that chenille but at last she found what she\r\nwanted at Clery\xe2\x80\x99s summer sales, the very it, slightly shopsoiled but you\r\nwould never notice, seven fingers two and a penny. She did it up all by\r\nherself and what joy was hers when she tried it on then, smiling at the\r\nlovely reflection which the mirror gave back to her! And when she put\r\nit on the waterjug to keep the shape she knew that that would take the\r\nshine out of some people she knew. Her shoes were the newest thing in\r\nfootwear (Edy Boardman prided herself that she was very petite but she\r\nnever had a foot like Gerty MacDowell, a five, and never would ash,\r\noak or elm) with patent toecaps and just one smart buckle over\r\nher higharched instep. Her wellturned ankle displayed its perfect\r\nproportions beneath her skirt and just the proper amount and no more of\r\nher shapely limbs encased in finespun hose with highspliced heels and\r\nwide garter tops. As for undies they were Gerty\xe2\x80\x99s chief care and who\r\nthat knows the fluttering hopes and fears of sweet seventeen (though\r\nGerty would never see seventeen again) can find it in his heart to\r\nblame her? She had four dinky sets with awfully pretty stitchery,\r\nthree garments and nighties extra, and each set slotted with different\r\ncoloured ribbons, rosepink, pale blue, mauve and peagreen, and she aired\r\nthem herself and blued them when they came home from the wash and ironed\r\nthem and she had a brickbat to keep the iron on because she wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ntrust those washerwomen as far as she\xe2\x80\x99d see them scorching the things.\r\nShe was wearing the blue for luck, hoping against hope, her own colour\r\nand lucky too for a bride to have a bit of blue somewhere on her because\r\nthe green she wore that day week brought grief because his father\r\nbrought him in to study for the intermediate exhibition and because\r\nshe thought perhaps he might be out because when she was dressing that\r\nmorning she nearly slipped up the old pair on her inside out and that\r\nwas for luck and lovers\xe2\x80\x99 meeting if you put those things on inside\r\nout or if they got untied that he was thinking about you so long as it\r\nwasn\xe2\x80\x99t of a Friday.\r\n\r\nAnd yet and yet! That strained look on her face! A gnawing sorrow is\r\nthere all the time. Her very soul is in her eyes and she would give\r\nworlds to be in the privacy of her own familiar chamber where, giving\r\nway to tears, she could have a good cry and relieve her pentup feelings\r\nthough not too much because she knew how to cry nicely before the\r\nmirror. You are lovely, Gerty, it said. The paly light of evening falls\r\nupon a face infinitely sad and wistful. Gerty MacDowell yearns in vain.\r\nYes, she had known from the very first that her daydream of a marriage\r\nhas been arranged and the weddingbells ringing for Mrs Reggy Wylie T.\r\nC. D. (because the one who married the elder brother would be Mrs Wylie)\r\nand in the fashionable intelligence Mrs Gertrude Wylie was wearing a\r\nsumptuous confection of grey trimmed with expensive blue fox was not\r\nto be. He was too young to understand. He would not believe in love, a\r\nwoman\xe2\x80\x99s birthright. The night of the party long ago in Stoer\xe2\x80\x99s (he was\r\nstill in short trousers) when they were alone and he stole an arm round\r\nher waist she went white to the very lips. He called her little one in\r\na strangely husky voice and snatched a half kiss (the first!) but it\r\nwas only the end of her nose and then he hastened from the room with a\r\nremark about refreshments. Impetuous fellow! Strength of character had\r\nnever been Reggy Wylie\xe2\x80\x99s strong point and he who would woo and win Gerty\r\nMacDowell must be a man among men. But waiting, always waiting to\r\nbe asked and it was leap year too and would soon be over. No prince\r\ncharming is her beau ideal to lay a rare and wondrous love at her feet\r\nbut rather a manly man with a strong quiet face who had not found\r\nhis ideal, perhaps his hair slightly flecked with grey, and who would\r\nunderstand, take her in his sheltering arms, strain her to him in all\r\nthe strength of his deep passionate nature and comfort her with a long\r\nlong kiss. It would be like heaven. For such a one she yearns this balmy\r\nsummer eve. With all the heart of her she longs to be his only, his\r\naffianced bride for riches for poor, in sickness in health, till death\r\nus two part, from this to this day forward.\r\n\r\nAnd while Edy Boardman was with little Tommy behind the pushcar she was\r\njust thinking would the day ever come when she could call herself his\r\nlittle wife to be. Then they could talk about her till they went blue in\r\nthe face, Bertha Supple too, and Edy, little spitfire, because she would\r\nbe twentytwo in November. She would care for him with creature comforts\r\ntoo for Gerty was womanly wise and knew that a mere man liked that\r\nfeeling of hominess. Her griddlecakes done to a goldenbrown hue and\r\nqueen Ann\xe2\x80\x99s pudding of delightful creaminess had won golden opinions\r\nfrom all because she had a lucky hand also for lighting a fire, dredge\r\nin the fine selfraising flour and always stir in the same direction,\r\nthen cream the milk and sugar and whisk well the white of eggs though\r\nshe didn\xe2\x80\x99t like the eating part when there were any people that made her\r\nshy and often she wondered why you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t eat something poetical like\r\nviolets or roses and they would have a beautifully appointed drawingroom\r\nwith pictures and engravings and the photograph of grandpapa Giltrap\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nlovely dog Garryowen that almost talked it was so human and chintz\r\ncovers for the chairs and that silver toastrack in Clery\xe2\x80\x99s summer\r\njumble sales like they have in rich houses. He would be tall with\r\nbroad shoulders (she had always admired tall men for a husband) with\r\nglistening white teeth under his carefully trimmed sweeping moustache\r\nand they would go on the continent for their honeymoon (three wonderful\r\nweeks!) and then, when they settled down in a nice snug and cosy little\r\nhomely house, every morning they would both have brekky, simple but\r\nperfectly served, for their own two selves and before he went out to\r\nbusiness he would give his dear little wifey a good hearty hug and gaze\r\nfor a moment deep down into her eyes.\r\n\r\nEdy Boardman asked Tommy Caffrey was he done and he said yes so then she\r\nbuttoned up his little knickerbockers for him and told him to run off\r\nand play with Jacky and to be good now and not to fight. But Tommy said\r\nhe wanted the ball and Edy told him no that baby was playing with the\r\nball and if he took it there\xe2\x80\x99d be wigs on the green but Tommy said it\r\nwas his ball and he wanted his ball and he pranced on the ground, if\r\nyou please. The temper of him! O, he was a man already was little Tommy\r\nCaffrey since he was out of pinnies. Edy told him no, no and to be off\r\nnow with him and she told Cissy Caffrey not to give in to him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94You\xe2\x80\x99re not my sister, naughty Tommy said. It\xe2\x80\x99s my ball.\r\n\r\nBut Cissy Caffrey told baby Boardman to look up, look up high at her\r\nfinger and she snatched the ball quickly and threw it along the sand and\r\nTommy after it in full career, having won the day.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Anything for a quiet life, laughed Ciss.\r\n\r\nAnd she tickled tiny tot\xe2\x80\x99s two cheeks to make him forget and played\r\nhere\xe2\x80\x99s the lord mayor, here\xe2\x80\x99s his two horses, here\xe2\x80\x99s his gingerbread\r\ncarriage and here he walks in, chinchopper, chinchopper, chinchopper\r\nchin. But Edy got as cross as two sticks about him getting his own way\r\nlike that from everyone always petting him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99d like to give him something, she said, so I would, where I won\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nsay.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94On the beeoteetom, laughed Cissy merrily.\r\n\r\nGerty MacDowell bent down her head and crimsoned at the idea of Cissy\r\nsaying an unladylike thing like that out loud she\xe2\x80\x99d be ashamed of her\r\nlife to say, flushing a deep rosy red, and Edy Boardman said she was\r\nsure the gentleman opposite heard what she said. But not a pin cared\r\nCiss.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Let him! she said with a pert toss of her head and a piquant tilt of\r\nher nose. Give it to him too on the same place as quick as I\xe2\x80\x99d look at\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nMadcap Ciss with her golliwog curls. You had to laugh at her sometimes.\r\nFor instance when she asked you would you have some more Chinese tea and\r\njaspberry ram and when she drew the jugs too and the men\xe2\x80\x99s faces on her\r\nnails with red ink make you split your sides or when she wanted to go\r\nwhere you know she said she wanted to run and pay a visit to the Miss\r\nWhite. That was just like Cissycums. O, and will you ever forget her the\r\nevening she dressed up in her father\xe2\x80\x99s suit and hat and the burned cork\r\nmoustache and walked down Tritonville road, smoking a cigarette. There\r\nwas none to come up to her for fun. But she was sincerity itself, one of\r\nthe bravest and truest hearts heaven ever made, not one of your twofaced\r\nthings, too sweet to be wholesome.\r\n\r\nAnd then there came out upon the air the sound of voices and the pealing\r\nanthem of the organ. It was the men\xe2\x80\x99s temperance retreat conducted\r\nby the missioner, the reverend John Hughes S. J., rosary, sermon and\r\nbenediction of the Most Blessed Sacrament. They were there gathered\r\ntogether without distinction of social class (and a most edifying\r\nspectacle it was to see) in that simple fane beside the waves, after the\r\nstorms of this weary world, kneeling before the feet of the immaculate,\r\nreciting the litany of Our Lady of Loreto, beseeching her to intercede\r\nfor them, the old familiar words, holy Mary, holy virgin of virgins. How\r\nsad to poor Gerty\xe2\x80\x99s ears! Had her father only avoided the clutches of\r\nthe demon drink, by taking the pledge or those powders the drink habit\r\ncured in Pearson\xe2\x80\x99s Weekly, she might now be rolling in her carriage,\r\nsecond to none. Over and over had she told herself that as she mused by\r\nthe dying embers in a brown study without the lamp because she hated two\r\nlights or oftentimes gazing out of the window dreamily by the hour at\r\nthe rain falling on the rusty bucket, thinking. But that vile decoction\r\nwhich has ruined so many hearths and homes had cast its shadow over her\r\nchildhood days. Nay, she had even witnessed in the home circle deeds of\r\nviolence caused by intemperance and had seen her own father, a prey to\r\nthe fumes of intoxication, forget himself completely for if there was\r\none thing of all things that Gerty knew it was that the man who lifts\r\nhis hand to a woman save in the way of kindness, deserves to be branded\r\nas the lowest of the low.\r\n\r\nAnd still the voices sang in supplication to the Virgin most powerful,\r\nVirgin most merciful. And Gerty, rapt in thought, scarce saw or heard\r\nher companions or the twins at their boyish gambols or the gentleman\r\noff Sandymount green that Cissy Caffrey called the man that was so like\r\nhimself passing along the strand taking a short walk. You never saw him\r\nany way screwed but still and for all that she would not like him for a\r\nfather because he was too old or something or on account of his face\r\n(it was a palpable case of Doctor Fell) or his carbuncly nose with the\r\npimples on it and his sandy moustache a bit white under his nose. Poor\r\nfather! With all his faults she loved him still when he sang Tell me,\r\nMary, how to woo thee or My love and cottage near Rochelle and they had\r\nstewed cockles and lettuce with Lazenby\xe2\x80\x99s salad dressing for supper and\r\nwhen he sang The moon hath raised with Mr Dignam that died suddenly and\r\nwas buried, God have mercy on him, from a stroke. Her mother\xe2\x80\x99s birthday\r\nthat was and Charley was home on his holidays and Tom and Mr Dignam and\r\nMrs and Patsy and Freddy Dignam and they were to have had a group taken.\r\nNo-one would have thought the end was so near. Now he was laid to rest.\r\nAnd her mother said to him to let that be a warning to him for the rest\r\nof his days and he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t even go to the funeral on account of the\r\ngout and she had to go into town to bring him the letters and samples\r\nfrom his office about Catesby\xe2\x80\x99s cork lino, artistic, standard designs,\r\nfit for a palace, gives tiptop wear and always bright and cheery in the\r\nhome.\r\n\r\nA sterling good daughter was Gerty just like a second mother in the\r\nhouse, a ministering angel too with a little heart worth its weight in\r\ngold. And when her mother had those raging splitting headaches who was\r\nit rubbed the menthol cone on her forehead but Gerty though she didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nlike her mother\xe2\x80\x99s taking pinches of snuff and that was the only single\r\nthing they ever had words about, taking snuff. Everyone thought the\r\nworld of her for her gentle ways. It was Gerty who turned off the gas at\r\nthe main every night and it was Gerty who tacked up on the wall of that\r\nplace where she never forgot every fortnight the chlorate of lime Mr\r\nTunney the grocer\xe2\x80\x99s christmas almanac, the picture of halcyon days\r\nwhere a young gentleman in the costume they used to wear then with a\r\nthreecornered hat was offering a bunch of flowers to his ladylove with\r\noldtime chivalry through her lattice window. You could see there was a\r\nstory behind it. The colours were done something lovely. She was in\r\na soft clinging white in a studied attitude and the gentleman was in\r\nchocolate and he looked a thorough aristocrat. She often looked at them\r\ndreamily when she went there for a certain purpose and felt her own\r\narms that were white and soft just like hers with the sleeves back\r\nand thought about those times because she had found out in Walker\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npronouncing dictionary that belonged to grandpapa Giltrap about the\r\nhalcyon days what they meant.\r\n\r\nThe twins were now playing in the most approved brotherly fashion\r\ntill at last Master Jacky who was really as bold as brass there was\r\nno getting behind that deliberately kicked the ball as hard as ever he\r\ncould down towards the seaweedy rocks. Needless to say poor Tommy was\r\nnot slow to voice his dismay but luckily the gentleman in black who was\r\nsitting there by himself came gallantly to the rescue and intercepted\r\nthe ball. Our two champions claimed their plaything with lusty cries and\r\nto avoid trouble Cissy Caffrey called to the gentleman to throw it to\r\nher please. The gentleman aimed the ball once or twice and then threw\r\nit up the strand towards Cissy Caffrey but it rolled down the slope and\r\nstopped right under Gerty\xe2\x80\x99s skirt near the little pool by the rock. The\r\ntwins clamoured again for it and Cissy told her to kick it away and\r\nlet them fight for it so Gerty drew back her foot but she wished their\r\nstupid ball hadn\xe2\x80\x99t come rolling down to her and she gave a kick but she\r\nmissed and Edy and Cissy laughed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94If you fail try again, Edy Boardman said.\r\n\r\nGerty smiled assent and bit her lip. A delicate pink crept into her\r\npretty cheek but she was determined to let them see so she just lifted\r\nher skirt a little but just enough and took good aim and gave the ball a\r\njolly good kick and it went ever so far and the two twins after it down\r\ntowards the shingle. Pure jealousy of course it was nothing else to draw\r\nattention on account of the gentleman opposite looking. She felt the\r\nwarm flush, a danger signal always with Gerty MacDowell, surging and\r\nflaming into her cheeks. Till then they had only exchanged glances of\r\nthe most casual but now under the brim of her new hat she ventured a\r\nlook at him and the face that met her gaze there in the twilight, wan\r\nand strangely drawn, seemed to her the saddest she had ever seen.\r\n\r\nThrough the open window of the church the fragrant incense was wafted\r\nand with it the fragrant names of her who was conceived without stain of\r\noriginal sin, spiritual vessel, pray for us, honourable vessel, pray\r\nfor us, vessel of singular devotion, pray for us, mystical rose. And\r\ncareworn hearts were there and toilers for their daily bread and many\r\nwho had erred and wandered, their eyes wet with contrition but for all\r\nthat bright with hope for the reverend father Father Hughes had told\r\nthem what the great saint Bernard said in his famous prayer of Mary, the\r\nmost pious Virgin\xe2\x80\x99s intercessory power that it was not recorded in any\r\nage that those who implored her powerful protection were ever abandoned\r\nby her.\r\n\r\nThe twins were now playing again right merrily for the troubles of\r\nchildhood are but as fleeting summer showers. Cissy Caffrey played with\r\nbaby Boardman till he crowed with glee, clapping baby hands in air. Peep\r\nshe cried behind the hood of the pushcar and Edy asked where was Cissy\r\ngone and then Cissy popped up her head and cried ah! and, my word,\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t the little chap enjoy that! And then she told him to say papa.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Say papa, baby. Say pa pa pa pa pa pa pa.\r\n\r\nAnd baby did his level best to say it for he was very intelligent for\r\neleven months everyone said and big for his age and the picture of\r\nhealth, a perfect little bunch of love, and he would certainly turn out\r\nto be something great, they said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Haja ja ja haja.\r\n\r\nCissy wiped his little mouth with the dribbling bib and wanted him to\r\nsit up properly and say pa pa pa but when she undid the strap she cried\r\nout, holy saint Denis, that he was possing wet and to double the half\r\nblanket the other way under him. Of course his infant majesty was most\r\nobstreperous at such toilet formalities and he let everyone know it:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Habaa baaaahabaaa baaaa.\r\n\r\nAnd two great big lovely big tears coursing down his cheeks. It was all\r\nno use soothering him with no, nono, baby, no and telling him about the\r\ngeegee and where was the puffpuff but Ciss, always readywitted, gave\r\nhim in his mouth the teat of the suckingbottle and the young heathen was\r\nquickly appeased.\r\n\r\nGerty wished to goodness they would take their squalling baby home out\r\nof that and not get on her nerves, no hour to be out, and the little\r\nbrats of twins. She gazed out towards the distant sea. It was like the\r\npaintings that man used to do on the pavement with all the coloured\r\nchalks and such a pity too leaving them there to be all blotted out, the\r\nevening and the clouds coming out and the Bailey light on Howth and to\r\nhear the music like that and the perfume of those incense they burned\r\nin the church like a kind of waft. And while she gazed her heart went\r\npitapat. Yes, it was her he was looking at, and there was meaning in his\r\nlook. His eyes burned into her as though they would search her through\r\nand through, read her very soul. Wonderful eyes they were, superbly\r\nexpressive, but could you trust them? People were so queer. She could\r\nsee at once by his dark eyes and his pale intellectual face that he\r\nwas a foreigner, the image of the photo she had of Martin Harvey, the\r\nmatinee idol, only for the moustache which she preferred because she\r\nwasn\xe2\x80\x99t stagestruck like Winny Rippingham that wanted they two to always\r\ndress the same on account of a play but she could not see whether he had\r\nan aquiline nose or a slightly retrouss\xc3\xa9 from where he was sitting. He\r\nwas in deep mourning, she could see that, and the story of a haunting\r\nsorrow was written on his face. She would have given worlds to know what\r\nit was. He was looking up so intently, so still, and he saw her kick the\r\nball and perhaps he could see the bright steel buckles of her shoes if\r\nshe swung them like that thoughtfully with the toes down. She was glad\r\nthat something told her to put on the transparent stockings thinking\r\nReggy Wylie might be out but that was far away. Here was that of which\r\nshe had so often dreamed. It was he who mattered and there was joy on\r\nher face because she wanted him because she felt instinctively that he\r\nwas like no-one else. The very heart of the girlwoman went out to him,\r\nher dreamhusband, because she knew on the instant it was him. If he had\r\nsuffered, more sinned against than sinning, or even, even, if he had\r\nbeen himself a sinner, a wicked man, she cared not. Even if he was a\r\nprotestant or methodist she could convert him easily if he truly loved\r\nher. There were wounds that wanted healing with heartbalm. She was a\r\nwomanly woman not like other flighty girls unfeminine he had known,\r\nthose cyclists showing off what they hadn\xe2\x80\x99t got and she just yearned to\r\nknow all, to forgive all if she could make him fall in love with her,\r\nmake him forget the memory of the past. Then mayhap he would embrace her\r\ngently, like a real man, crushing her soft body to him, and love her,\r\nhis ownest girlie, for herself alone.\r\n\r\nRefuge of sinners. Comfortress of the afflicted. Ora pro nobis. Well has\r\nit been said that whosoever prays to her with faith and constancy can\r\nnever be lost or cast away: and fitly is she too a haven of refuge for\r\nthe afflicted because of the seven dolours which transpierced her own\r\nheart. Gerty could picture the whole scene in the church, the stained\r\nglass windows lighted up, the candles, the flowers and the blue banners\r\nof the blessed Virgin\xe2\x80\x99s sodality and Father Conroy was helping Canon\r\nO\xe2\x80\x99Hanlon at the altar, carrying things in and out with his eyes cast\r\ndown. He looked almost a saint and his confessionbox was so quiet and\r\nclean and dark and his hands were just like white wax and if ever she\r\nbecame a Dominican nun in their white habit perhaps he might come to the\r\nconvent for the novena of Saint Dominic. He told her that time when she\r\ntold him about that in confession, crimsoning up to the roots of her\r\nhair for fear he could see, not to be troubled because that was only the\r\nvoice of nature and we were all subject to nature\xe2\x80\x99s laws, he said, in\r\nthis life and that that was no sin because that came from the nature of\r\nwoman instituted by God, he said, and that Our Blessed Lady herself said\r\nto the archangel Gabriel be it done unto me according to Thy Word. He\r\nwas so kind and holy and often and often she thought and thought could\r\nshe work a ruched teacosy with embroidered floral design for him as a\r\npresent or a clock but they had a clock she noticed on the mantelpiece\r\nwhite and gold with a canarybird that came out of a little house to tell\r\nthe time the day she went there about the flowers for the forty hours\xe2\x80\x99\r\nadoration because it was hard to know what sort of a present to give or\r\nperhaps an album of illuminated views of Dublin or some place.\r\n\r\nThe exasperating little brats of twins began to quarrel again and Jacky\r\nthrew the ball out towards the sea and they both ran after it. Little\r\nmonkeys common as ditchwater. Someone ought to take them and give them\r\na good hiding for themselves to keep them in their places, the both of\r\nthem. And Cissy and Edy shouted after them to come back because they\r\nwere afraid the tide might come in on them and be drowned.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Jacky! Tommy!\r\n\r\nNot they! What a great notion they had! So Cissy said it was the very\r\nlast time she\xe2\x80\x99d ever bring them out. She jumped up and called them and\r\nshe ran down the slope past him, tossing her hair behind her which had\r\na good enough colour if there had been more of it but with all the\r\nthingamerry she was always rubbing into it she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get it to grow\r\nlong because it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t natural so she could just go and throw her hat at\r\nit. She ran with long gandery strides it was a wonder she didn\xe2\x80\x99t rip up\r\nher skirt at the side that was too tight on her because there was a lot\r\nof the tomboy about Cissy Caffrey and she was a forward piece whenever\r\nshe thought she had a good opportunity to show off and just because she\r\nwas a good runner she ran like that so that he could see all the end of\r\nher petticoat running and her skinny shanks up as far as possible. It\r\nwould have served her just right if she had tripped up over something\r\naccidentally on purpose with her high crooked French heels on her to\r\nmake her look tall and got a fine tumble. Tableau! That would have been\r\na very charming expos\xc3\xa9 for a gentleman like that to witness.\r\n\r\nQueen of angels, queen of patriarchs, queen of prophets, of all saints,\r\nthey prayed, queen of the most holy rosary and then Father Conroy handed\r\nthe thurible to Canon O\xe2\x80\x99Hanlon and he put in the incense and censed the\r\nBlessed Sacrament and Cissy Caffrey caught the two twins and she was\r\nitching to give them a ringing good clip on the ear but she didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nbecause she thought he might be watching but she never made a bigger\r\nmistake in all her life because Gerty could see without looking that\r\nhe never took his eyes off of her and then Canon O\xe2\x80\x99Hanlon handed the\r\nthurible back to Father Conroy and knelt down looking up at the Blessed\r\nSacrament and the choir began to sing the Tantum ergo and she just swung\r\nher foot in and out in time as the music rose and fell to the Tantumer\r\ngosa cramen tum. Three and eleven she paid for those stockings in\r\nSparrow\xe2\x80\x99s of George\xe2\x80\x99s street on the Tuesday, no the Monday before Easter\r\nand there wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a brack on them and that was what he was looking at,\r\ntransparent, and not at her insignificant ones that had neither shape\r\nnor form (the cheek of her!) because he had eyes in his head to see the\r\ndifference for himself.\r\n\r\nCissy came up along the strand with the two twins and their ball with\r\nher hat anyhow on her to one side after her run and she did look a\r\nstreel tugging the two kids along with the flimsy blouse she bought only\r\na fortnight before like a rag on her back and a bit of her petticoat\r\nhanging like a caricature. Gerty just took off her hat for a moment to\r\nsettle her hair and a prettier, a daintier head of nutbrown tresses\r\nwas never seen on a girl\xe2\x80\x99s shoulders\xe2\x80\x94a radiant little vision, in sooth,\r\nalmost maddening in its sweetness. You would have to travel many a long\r\nmile before you found a head of hair the like of that. She could almost\r\nsee the swift answering flash of admiration in his eyes that set her\r\ntingling in every nerve. She put on her hat so that she could see from\r\nunderneath the brim and swung her buckled shoe faster for her breath\r\ncaught as she caught the expression in his eyes. He was eying her as a\r\nsnake eyes its prey. Her woman\xe2\x80\x99s instinct told her that she had raised\r\nthe devil in him and at the thought a burning scarlet swept from throat\r\nto brow till the lovely colour of her face became a glorious rose.\r\n\r\nEdy Boardman was noticing it too because she was squinting at Gerty,\r\nhalf smiling, with her specs like an old maid, pretending to nurse the\r\nbaby. Irritable little gnat she was and always would be and that was why\r\nno-one could get on with her poking her nose into what was no concern of\r\nhers. And she said to Gerty:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94A penny for your thoughts.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94What? replied Gerty with a smile reinforced by the whitest of teeth. I\r\nwas only wondering was it late.\r\n\r\nBecause she wished to goodness they\xe2\x80\x99d take the snottynosed twins and\r\ntheir babby home to the mischief out of that so that was why she just\r\ngave a gentle hint about its being late. And when Cissy came up Edy\r\nasked her the time and Miss Cissy, as glib as you like, said it was half\r\npast kissing time, time to kiss again. But Edy wanted to know because\r\nthey were told to be in early.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Wait, said Cissy, I\xe2\x80\x99ll run ask my uncle Peter over there what\xe2\x80\x99s the\r\ntime by his conundrum.\r\n\r\nSo over she went and when he saw her coming she could see him take his\r\nhand out of his pocket, getting nervous, and beginning to play with his\r\nwatchchain, looking up at the church. Passionate nature though he was\r\nGerty could see that he had enormous control over himself. One moment he\r\nhad been there, fascinated by a loveliness that made him gaze, and the\r\nnext moment it was the quiet gravefaced gentleman, selfcontrol expressed\r\nin every line of his distinguishedlooking figure.\r\n\r\nCissy said to excuse her would he mind please telling her what was the\r\nright time and Gerty could see him taking out his watch, listening to it\r\nand looking up and clearing his throat and he said he was very sorry his\r\nwatch was stopped but he thought it must be after eight because the\r\nsun was set. His voice had a cultured ring in it and though he spoke in\r\nmeasured accents there was a suspicion of a quiver in the mellow tones.\r\nCissy said thanks and came back with her tongue out and said uncle said\r\nhis waterworks were out of order.\r\n\r\nThen they sang the second verse of the Tantum ergo and Canon O\xe2\x80\x99Hanlon\r\ngot up again and censed the Blessed Sacrament and knelt down and he told\r\nFather Conroy that one of the candles was just going to set fire to the\r\nflowers and Father Conroy got up and settled it all right and she could\r\nsee the gentleman winding his watch and listening to the works and she\r\nswung her leg more in and out in time. It was getting darker but he\r\ncould see and he was looking all the time that he was winding the watch\r\nor whatever he was doing to it and then he put it back and put his hands\r\nback into his pockets. She felt a kind of a sensation rushing all over\r\nher and she knew by the feel of her scalp and that irritation against\r\nher stays that that thing must be coming on because the last time too\r\nwas when she clipped her hair on account of the moon. His dark eyes\r\nfixed themselves on her again drinking in her every contour, literally\r\nworshipping at her shrine. If ever there was undisguised admiration in a\r\nman\xe2\x80\x99s passionate gaze it was there plain to be seen on that man\xe2\x80\x99s face.\r\nIt is for you, Gertrude MacDowell, and you know it.\r\n\r\nEdy began to get ready to go and it was high time for her and Gerty\r\nnoticed that that little hint she gave had had the desired effect\r\nbecause it was a long way along the strand to where there was the place\r\nto push up the pushcar and Cissy took off the twins\xe2\x80\x99 caps and tidied\r\ntheir hair to make herself attractive of course and Canon O\xe2\x80\x99Hanlon stood\r\nup with his cope poking up at his neck and Father Conroy handed him the\r\ncard to read off and he read out Panem de coelo praestitisti eis and Edy\r\nand Cissy were talking about the time all the time and asking her but\r\nGerty could pay them back in their own coin and she just answered with\r\nscathing politeness when Edy asked her was she heartbroken about her\r\nbest boy throwing her over. Gerty winced sharply. A brief cold blaze\r\nshone from her eyes that spoke volumes of scorn immeasurable. It hurt\xe2\x80\x94O\r\nyes, it cut deep because Edy had her own quiet way of saying things\r\nlike that she knew would wound like the confounded little cat she was.\r\nGerty\xe2\x80\x99s lips parted swiftly to frame the word but she fought back\r\nthe sob that rose to her throat, so slim, so flawless, so beautifully\r\nmoulded it seemed one an artist might have dreamed of. She had loved him\r\nbetter than he knew. Lighthearted deceiver and fickle like all his sex\r\nhe would never understand what he had meant to her and for an instant\r\nthere was in the blue eyes a quick stinging of tears. Their eyes were\r\nprobing her mercilessly but with a brave effort she sparkled back in\r\nsympathy as she glanced at her new conquest for them to see.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94O, responded Gerty, quick as lightning, laughing, and the proud head\r\nflashed up. I can throw my cap at who I like because it\xe2\x80\x99s leap year.\r\n\r\nHer words rang out crystalclear, more musical than the cooing of the\r\nringdove, but they cut the silence icily. There was that in her young\r\nvoice that told that she was not a one to be lightly trifled with. As\r\nfor Mr Reggy with his swank and his bit of money she could just chuck\r\nhim aside as if he was so much filth and never again would she cast as\r\nmuch as a second thought on him and tear his silly postcard into a dozen\r\npieces. And if ever after he dared to presume she could give him one\r\nlook of measured scorn that would make him shrivel up on the spot. Miss\r\npuny little Edy\xe2\x80\x99s countenance fell to no slight extent and Gerty could\r\nsee by her looking as black as thunder that she was simply in a towering\r\nrage though she hid it, the little kinnatt, because that shaft had\r\nstruck home for her petty jealousy and they both knew that she was\r\nsomething aloof, apart, in another sphere, that she was not of them and\r\nnever would be and there was somebody else too that knew it and saw it\r\nso they could put that in their pipe and smoke it.\r\n\r\nEdy straightened up baby Boardman to get ready to go and Cissy tucked in\r\nthe ball and the spades and buckets and it was high time too because the\r\nsandman was on his way for Master Boardman junior. And Cissy told him\r\ntoo that billy winks was coming and that baby was to go deedaw and baby\r\nlooked just too ducky, laughing up out of his gleeful eyes, and Cissy\r\npoked him like that out of fun in his wee fat tummy and baby, without as\r\nmuch as by your leave, sent up his compliments to all and sundry on to\r\nhis brandnew dribbling bib.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94O my! Puddeny pie! protested Ciss. He has his bib destroyed.\r\n\r\nThe slight contretemps claimed her attention but in two twos she set\r\nthat little matter to rights.\r\n\r\nGerty stifled a smothered exclamation and gave a nervous cough and Edy\r\nasked what and she was just going to tell her to catch it while it was\r\nflying but she was ever ladylike in her deportment so she simply passed\r\nit off with consummate tact by saying that that was the benediction\r\nbecause just then the bell rang out from the steeple over the quiet\r\nseashore because Canon O\xe2\x80\x99Hanlon was up on the altar with the veil that\r\nFather Conroy put round his shoulders giving the benediction with the\r\nBlessed Sacrament in his hands.\r\n\r\nHow moving the scene there in the gathering twilight, the last glimpse\r\nof Erin, the touching chime of those evening bells and at the same\r\ntime a bat flew forth from the ivied belfry through the dusk, hither,\r\nthither, with a tiny lost cry. And she could see far away the lights of\r\nthe lighthouses so picturesque she would have loved to do with a box of\r\npaints because it was easier than to make a man and soon the lamplighter\r\nwould be going his rounds past the presbyterian church grounds and along\r\nby shady Tritonville avenue where the couples walked and lighting the\r\nlamp near her window where Reggy Wylie used to turn his freewheel like\r\nshe read in that book The Lamplighter by Miss Cummins, author of Mabel\r\nVaughan and other tales. For Gerty had her dreams that no-one knew of.\r\nShe loved to read poetry and when she got a keepsake from Bertha Supple\r\nof that lovely confession album with the coralpink cover to write her\r\nthoughts in she laid it in the drawer of her toilettable which, though\r\nit did not err on the side of luxury, was scrupulously neat and clean.\r\nIt was there she kept her girlish treasure trove, the tortoiseshell\r\ncombs, her child of Mary badge, the whiterose scent, the eyebrowleine,\r\nher alabaster pouncetbox and the ribbons to change when her things came\r\nhome from the wash and there were some beautiful thoughts written in it\r\nin violet ink that she bought in Hely\xe2\x80\x99s of Dame Street for she felt that\r\nshe too could write poetry if she could only express herself like that\r\npoem that appealed to her so deeply that she had copied out of the\r\nnewspaper she found one evening round the potherbs. Art thou real, my\r\nideal? it was called by Louis J Walsh, Magherafelt, and after there was\r\nsomething about twilight, wilt thou ever? and ofttimes the beauty of\r\npoetry, so sad in its transient loveliness, had misted her eyes with\r\nsilent tears for she felt that the years were slipping by for her,\r\none by one, and but for that one shortcoming she knew she need fear no\r\ncompetition and that was an accident coming down Dalkey hill and she\r\nalways tried to conceal it. But it must end, she felt. If she saw that\r\nmagic lure in his eyes there would be no holding back for her. Love\r\nlaughs at locksmiths. She would make the great sacrifice. Her every\r\neffort would be to share his thoughts. Dearer than the whole world\r\nwould she be to him and gild his days with happiness. There was the\r\nallimportant question and she was dying to know was he a married man or\r\na widower who had lost his wife or some tragedy like the nobleman\r\nwith the foreign name from the land of song had to have her put into a\r\nmadhouse, cruel only to be kind. But even if\xe2\x80\x94what then? Would it make\r\na very great difference? From everything in the least indelicate her\r\nfinebred nature instinctively recoiled. She loathed that sort of person,\r\nthe fallen women off the accommodation walk beside the Dodder that went\r\nwith the soldiers and coarse men with no respect for a girl\xe2\x80\x99s honour,\r\ndegrading the sex and being taken up to the police station. No, no:\r\nnot that. They would be just good friends like a big brother and sister\r\nwithout all that other in spite of the conventions of Society with a big\r\ness. Perhaps it was an old flame he was in mourning for from the days\r\nbeyond recall. She thought she understood. She would try to understand\r\nhim because men were so different. The old love was waiting, waiting\r\nwith little white hands stretched out, with blue appealing eyes. Heart\r\nof mine! She would follow, her dream of love, the dictates of her heart\r\nthat told her he was her all in all, the only man in all the world for\r\nher for love was the master guide. Nothing else mattered. Come what\r\nmight she would be wild, untrammelled, free.\r\n\r\nCanon O\xe2\x80\x99Hanlon put the Blessed Sacrament back into the tabernacle and\r\ngenuflected and the choir sang Laudate Dominum omnes gentes and then he\r\nlocked the tabernacle door because the benediction was over and Father\r\nConroy handed him his hat to put on and crosscat Edy asked wasn\xe2\x80\x99t she\r\ncoming but Jacky Caffrey called out:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94O, look, Cissy!\r\n\r\nAnd they all looked was it sheet lightning but Tommy saw it too over the\r\ntrees beside the church, blue and then green and purple.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94It\xe2\x80\x99s fireworks, Cissy Caffrey said.\r\n\r\nAnd they all ran down the strand to see over the houses and the church,\r\nhelterskelter, Edy with the pushcar with baby Boardman in it and Cissy\r\nholding Tommy and Jacky by the hand so they wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t fall running.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Come on, Gerty, Cissy called. It\xe2\x80\x99s the bazaar fireworks.\r\n\r\nBut Gerty was adamant. She had no intention of being at their beck and\r\ncall. If they could run like rossies she could sit so she said she could\r\nsee from where she was. The eyes that were fastened upon her set her\r\npulses tingling. She looked at him a moment, meeting his glance, and\r\na light broke in upon her. Whitehot passion was in that face, passion\r\nsilent as the grave, and it had made her his. At last they were left\r\nalone without the others to pry and pass remarks and she knew he could\r\nbe trusted to the death, steadfast, a sterling man, a man of inflexible\r\nhonour to his fingertips. His hands and face were working and a tremour\r\nwent over her. She leaned back far to look up where the fireworks were\r\nand she caught her knee in her hands so as not to fall back looking up\r\nand there was no-one to see only him and her when she revealed all her\r\ngraceful beautifully shaped legs like that, supply soft and delicately\r\nrounded, and she seemed to hear the panting of his heart, his hoarse\r\nbreathing, because she knew too about the passion of men like that,\r\nhotblooded, because Bertha Supple told her once in dead secret and made\r\nher swear she\xe2\x80\x99d never about the gentleman lodger that was staying with\r\nthem out of the Congested Districts Board that had pictures cut out of\r\npapers of those skirtdancers and highkickers and she said he used to do\r\nsomething not very nice that you could imagine sometimes in the bed. But\r\nthis was altogether different from a thing like that because there was\r\nall the difference because she could almost feel him draw her face to\r\nhis and the first quick hot touch of his handsome lips. Besides there\r\nwas absolution so long as you didn\xe2\x80\x99t do the other thing before being\r\nmarried and there ought to be women priests that would understand\r\nwithout your telling out and Cissy Caffrey too sometimes had that dreamy\r\nkind of dreamy look in her eyes so that she too, my dear, and Winny\r\nRippingham so mad about actors\xe2\x80\x99 photographs and besides it was on\r\naccount of that other thing coming on the way it did.\r\n\r\nAnd Jacky Caffrey shouted to look, there was another and she leaned back\r\nand the garters were blue to match on account of the transparent and\r\nthey all saw it and they all shouted to look, look, there it was and\r\nshe leaned back ever so far to see the fireworks and something queer was\r\nflying through the air, a soft thing, to and fro, dark. And she saw a\r\nlong Roman candle going up over the trees, up, up, and, in the tense\r\nhush, they were all breathless with excitement as it went higher and\r\nhigher and she had to lean back more and more to look up after it, high,\r\nhigh, almost out of sight, and her face was suffused with a divine, an\r\nentrancing blush from straining back and he could see her other things\r\ntoo, nainsook knickers, the fabric that caresses the skin, better than\r\nthose other pettiwidth, the green, four and eleven, on account of being\r\nwhite and she let him and she saw that he saw and then it went so high\r\nit went out of sight a moment and she was trembling in every limb from\r\nbeing bent so far back that he had a full view high up above her knee\r\nwhere no-one ever not even on the swing or wading and she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t ashamed\r\nand he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t either to look in that immodest way like that because he\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t resist the sight of the wondrous revealment half offered like\r\nthose skirtdancers behaving so immodest before gentlemen looking and he\r\nkept on looking, looking. She would fain have cried to him chokingly,\r\nheld out her snowy slender arms to him to come, to feel his lips laid on\r\nher white brow, the cry of a young girl\xe2\x80\x99s love, a little strangled cry,\r\nwrung from her, that cry that has rung through the ages. And then a\r\nrocket sprang and bang shot blind blank and O! then the Roman candle\r\nburst and it was like a sigh of O! and everyone cried O! O! in raptures\r\nand it gushed out of it a stream of rain gold hair threads and they\r\nshed and ah! they were all greeny dewy stars falling with golden, O so\r\nlovely, O, soft, sweet, soft!\r\n\r\nThen all melted away dewily in the grey air: all was silent. Ah! She\r\nglanced at him as she bent forward quickly, a pathetic little glance of\r\npiteous protest, of shy reproach under which he coloured like a girl. He\r\nwas leaning back against the rock behind. Leopold Bloom (for it is he)\r\nstands silent, with bowed head before those young guileless eyes. What a\r\nbrute he had been! At it again? A fair unsullied soul had called to him\r\nand, wretch that he was, how had he answered? An utter cad he had been!\r\nHe of all men! But there was an infinite store of mercy in those eyes,\r\nfor him too a word of pardon even though he had erred and sinned and\r\nwandered. Should a girl tell? No, a thousand times no. That was their\r\nsecret, only theirs, alone in the hiding twilight and there was none to\r\nknow or tell save the little bat that flew so softly through the evening\r\nto and fro and little bats don\xe2\x80\x99t tell.\r\n\r\nCissy Caffrey whistled, imitating the boys in the football field to show\r\nwhat a great person she was: and then she cried:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Gerty! Gerty! We\xe2\x80\x99re going. Come on. We can see from farther up.\r\n\r\nGerty had an idea, one of love\xe2\x80\x99s little ruses. She slipped a hand into\r\nher kerchief pocket and took out the wadding and waved in reply of\r\ncourse without letting him and then slipped it back. Wonder if he\xe2\x80\x99s too\r\nfar to. She rose. Was it goodbye? No. She had to go but they would meet\r\nagain, there, and she would dream of that till then, tomorrow, of her\r\ndream of yester eve. She drew herself up to her full height. Their souls\r\nmet in a last lingering glance and the eyes that reached her heart, full\r\nof a strange shining, hung enraptured on her sweet flowerlike face. She\r\nhalf smiled at him wanly, a sweet forgiving smile, a smile that verged\r\non tears, and then they parted.\r\n\r\nSlowly, without looking back she went down the uneven strand to Cissy,\r\nto Edy to Jacky and Tommy Caffrey, to little baby Boardman. It was\r\ndarker now and there were stones and bits of wood on the strand and\r\nslippy seaweed. She walked with a certain quiet dignity characteristic\r\nof her but with care and very slowly because\xe2\x80\x94because Gerty MacDowell\r\nwas...\r\n\r\nTight boots? No. She\xe2\x80\x99s lame! O!\r\n\r\nMr Bloom watched her as she limped away. Poor girl! That\xe2\x80\x99s why she\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nleft on the shelf and the others did a sprint. Thought something was\r\nwrong by the cut of her jib. Jilted beauty. A defect is ten times worse\r\nin a woman. But makes them polite. Glad I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know it when she was on\r\nshow. Hot little devil all the same. I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t mind. Curiosity like a\r\nnun or a negress or a girl with glasses. That squinty one is delicate.\r\nNear her monthlies, I expect, makes them feel ticklish. I have such\r\na bad headache today. Where did I put the letter? Yes, all right. All\r\nkinds of crazy longings. Licking pennies. Girl in Tranquilla convent\r\nthat nun told me liked to smell rock oil. Virgins go mad in the end I\r\nsuppose. Sister? How many women in Dublin have it today? Martha, she.\r\nSomething in the air. That\xe2\x80\x99s the moon. But then why don\xe2\x80\x99t all women\r\nmenstruate at the same time with the same moon, I mean? Depends on the\r\ntime they were born I suppose. Or all start scratch then get out of\r\nstep. Sometimes Molly and Milly together. Anyhow I got the best of that.\r\nDamned glad I didn\xe2\x80\x99t do it in the bath this morning over her silly I\r\nwill punish you letter. Made up for that tramdriver this morning. That\r\ngouger M\xe2\x80\x99Coy stopping me to say nothing. And his wife engagement in the\r\ncountry valise, voice like a pickaxe. Thankful for small mercies.\r\nCheap too. Yours for the asking. Because they want it themselves. Their\r\nnatural craving. Shoals of them every evening poured out of offices.\r\nReserve better. Don\xe2\x80\x99t want it they throw it at you. Catch em alive, O.\r\nPity they can\xe2\x80\x99t see themselves. A dream of wellfilled hose. Where was\r\nthat? Ah, yes. Mutoscope pictures in Capel street: for men only. Peeping\r\nTom. Willy\xe2\x80\x99s hat and what the girls did with it. Do they snapshot those\r\ngirls or is it all a fake? Lingerie does it. Felt for the curves inside\r\nher d\xc3\xa9shabill\xc3\xa9. Excites them also when they\xe2\x80\x99re. I\xe2\x80\x99m all clean come and\r\ndirty me. And they like dressing one another for the sacrifice. Milly\r\ndelighted with Molly\xe2\x80\x99s new blouse. At first. Put them all on to take\r\nthem all off. Molly. Why I bought her the violet garters. Us too: the\r\ntie he wore, his lovely socks and turnedup trousers. He wore a pair\r\nof gaiters the night that first we met. His lovely shirt was shining\r\nbeneath his what? of jet. Say a woman loses a charm with every pin she\r\ntakes out. Pinned together. O, Mairy lost the pin of her. Dressed up to\r\nthe nines for somebody. Fashion part of their charm. Just changes when\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99re on the track of the secret. Except the east: Mary, Martha: now as\r\nthen. No reasonable offer refused. She wasn\xe2\x80\x99t in a hurry either. Always\r\noff to a fellow when they are. They never forget an appointment. Out on\r\nspec probably. They believe in chance because like themselves. And the\r\nothers inclined to give her an odd dig. Girl friends at school, arms\r\nround each other\xe2\x80\x99s necks or with ten fingers locked, kissing and\r\nwhispering secrets about nothing in the convent garden. Nuns with\r\nwhitewashed faces, cool coifs and their rosaries going up and down,\r\nvindictive too for what they can\xe2\x80\x99t get. Barbed wire. Be sure now and\r\nwrite to me. And I\xe2\x80\x99ll write to you. Now won\xe2\x80\x99t you? Molly and Josie\r\nPowell. Till Mr Right comes along, then meet once in a blue moon.\r\nTableau! O, look who it is for the love of God! How are you at all? What\r\nhave you been doing with yourself? Kiss and delighted to, kiss, to see\r\nyou. Picking holes in each other\xe2\x80\x99s appearance. You\xe2\x80\x99re looking splendid.\r\nSister souls. Showing their teeth at one another. How many have you\r\nleft? Wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t lend each other a pinch of salt.\r\n\r\nAh!\r\n\r\nDevils they are when that\xe2\x80\x99s coming on them. Dark devilish appearance.\r\nMolly often told me feel things a ton weight. Scratch the sole of my\r\nfoot. O that way! O, that\xe2\x80\x99s exquisite! Feel it myself too. Good to rest\r\nonce in a way. Wonder if it\xe2\x80\x99s bad to go with them then. Safe in one way.\r\nTurns milk, makes fiddlestrings snap. Something about withering plants I\r\nread in a garden. Besides they say if the flower withers she wears she\xe2\x80\x99s\r\na flirt. All are. Daresay she felt I. When you feel like that you often\r\nmeet what you feel. Liked me or what? Dress they look at. Always know a\r\nfellow courting: collars and cuffs. Well cocks and lions do the same\r\nand stags. Same time might prefer a tie undone or something. Trousers?\r\nSuppose I when I was? No. Gently does it. Dislike rough and tumble. Kiss\r\nin the dark and never tell. Saw something in me. Wonder what. Sooner\r\nhave me as I am than some poet chap with bearsgrease plastery hair,\r\nlovelock over his dexter optic. To aid gentleman in literary. Ought to\r\nattend to my appearance my age. Didn\xe2\x80\x99t let her see me in profile. Still,\r\nyou never know. Pretty girls and ugly men marrying. Beauty and the\r\nbeast. Besides I can\xe2\x80\x99t be so if Molly. Took off her hat to show her\r\nhair. Wide brim. Bought to hide her face, meeting someone might know\r\nher, bend down or carry a bunch of flowers to smell. Hair strong in rut.\r\nTen bob I got for Molly\xe2\x80\x99s combings when we were on the rocks in Holles\r\nstreet. Why not? Suppose he gave her money. Why not? All a prejudice.\r\nShe\xe2\x80\x99s worth ten, fifteen, more, a pound. What? I think so. All that for\r\nnothing. Bold hand: Mrs Marion. Did I forget to write address on\r\nthat letter like the postcard I sent to Flynn? And the day I went to\r\nDrimmie\xe2\x80\x99s without a necktie. Wrangle with Molly it was put me off. No,\r\nI remember. Richie Goulding: he\xe2\x80\x99s another. Weighs on his mind. Funny\r\nmy watch stopped at half past four. Dust. Shark liver oil they use to\r\nclean. Could do it myself. Save. Was that just when he, she?\r\n\r\nO, he did. Into her. She did. Done.\r\n\r\nAh!\r\n\r\nMr Bloom with careful hand recomposed his wet shirt. O Lord, that little\r\nlimping devil. Begins to feel cold and clammy. Aftereffect not pleasant.\r\nStill you have to get rid of it someway. They don\xe2\x80\x99t care. Complimented\r\nperhaps. Go home to nicey bread and milky and say night prayers with the\r\nkiddies. Well, aren\xe2\x80\x99t they? See her as she is spoil all. Must have the\r\nstage setting, the rouge, costume, position, music. The name too. Amours\r\nof actresses. Nell Gwynn, Mrs Bracegirdle, Maud Branscombe. Curtain\r\nup. Moonlight silver effulgence. Maiden discovered with pensive bosom.\r\nLittle sweetheart come and kiss me. Still, I feel. The strength it gives\r\na man. That\xe2\x80\x99s the secret of it. Good job I let off there behind the wall\r\ncoming out of Dignam\xe2\x80\x99s. Cider that was. Otherwise I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have. Makes\r\nyou want to sing after. Lacaus esant taratara. Suppose I spoke to\r\nher. What about? Bad plan however if you don\xe2\x80\x99t know how to end the\r\nconversation. Ask them a question they ask you another. Good idea if\r\nyou\xe2\x80\x99re stuck. Gain time. But then you\xe2\x80\x99re in a cart. Wonderful of course\r\nif you say: good evening, and you see she\xe2\x80\x99s on for it: good evening. O\r\nbut the dark evening in the Appian way I nearly spoke to Mrs Clinch O\r\nthinking she was. Whew! Girl in Meath street that night. All the dirty\r\nthings I made her say. All wrong of course. My arks she called it. It\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nso hard to find one who. Aho! If you don\xe2\x80\x99t answer when they solicit must\r\nbe horrible for them till they harden. And kissed my hand when I gave\r\nher the extra two shillings. Parrots. Press the button and the bird will\r\nsqueak. Wish she hadn\xe2\x80\x99t called me sir. O, her mouth in the dark! And you\r\na married man with a single girl! That\xe2\x80\x99s what they enjoy. Taking a man\r\nfrom another woman. Or even hear of it. Different with me. Glad to get\r\naway from other chap\xe2\x80\x99s wife. Eating off his cold plate. Chap in the\r\nBurton today spitting back gumchewed gristle. French letter still in\r\nmy pocketbook. Cause of half the trouble. But might happen sometime,\r\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t think. Come in, all is prepared. I dreamt. What? Worst is\r\nbeginning. How they change the venue when it\xe2\x80\x99s not what they like. Ask\r\nyou do you like mushrooms because she once knew a gentleman who. Or ask\r\nyou what someone was going to say when he changed his mind and stopped.\r\nYet if I went the whole hog, say: I want to, something like that.\r\nBecause I did. She too. Offend her. Then make it up. Pretend to want\r\nsomething awfully, then cry off for her sake. Flatters them. She must\r\nhave been thinking of someone else all the time. What harm? Must since\r\nshe came to the use of reason, he, he and he. First kiss does the trick.\r\nThe propitious moment. Something inside them goes pop. Mushy like, tell\r\nby their eye, on the sly. First thoughts are best. Remember that till\r\ntheir dying day. Molly, lieutenant Mulvey that kissed her under the\r\nMoorish wall beside the gardens. Fifteen she told me. But her breasts\r\nwere developed. Fell asleep then. After Glencree dinner that was when we\r\ndrove home. Featherbed mountain. Gnashing her teeth in sleep. Lord mayor\r\nhad his eye on her too. Val Dillon. Apoplectic.\r\n\r\nThere she is with them down there for the fireworks. My fireworks. Up\r\nlike a rocket, down like a stick. And the children, twins they must\r\nbe, waiting for something to happen. Want to be grownups. Dressing in\r\nmother\xe2\x80\x99s clothes. Time enough, understand all the ways of the world. And\r\nthe dark one with the mop head and the nigger mouth. I knew she could\r\nwhistle. Mouth made for that. Like Molly. Why that highclass whore in\r\nJammet\xe2\x80\x99s wore her veil only to her nose. Would you mind, please, telling\r\nme the right time? I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you the right time up a dark lane.\r\nSay prunes and prisms forty times every morning, cure for fat lips.\r\nCaressing the little boy too. Onlookers see most of the game. Of course\r\nthey understand birds, animals, babies. In their line.\r\n\r\nDidn\xe2\x80\x99t look back when she was going down the strand. Wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t give that\r\nsatisfaction. Those girls, those girls, those lovely seaside girls. Fine\r\neyes she had, clear. It\xe2\x80\x99s the white of the eye brings that out not so\r\nmuch the pupil. Did she know what I? Course. Like a cat sitting beyond\r\na dog\xe2\x80\x99s jump. Women never meet one like that Wilkins in the high school\r\ndrawing a picture of Venus with all his belongings on show. Call that\r\ninnocence? Poor idiot! His wife has her work cut out for her. Never see\r\nthem sit on a bench marked Wet Paint. Eyes all over them. Look under\r\nthe bed for what\xe2\x80\x99s not there. Longing to get the fright of their lives.\r\nSharp as needles they are. When I said to Molly the man at the corner of\r\nCuffe street was goodlooking, thought she might like, twigged at once he\r\nhad a false arm. Had, too. Where do they get that? Typist going up Roger\r\nGreene\xe2\x80\x99s stairs two at a time to show her understandings. Handed down\r\nfrom father to, mother to daughter, I mean. Bred in the bone. Milly for\r\nexample drying her handkerchief on the mirror to save the ironing. Best\r\nplace for an ad to catch a woman\xe2\x80\x99s eye on a mirror. And when I sent\r\nher for Molly\xe2\x80\x99s Paisley shawl to Prescott\xe2\x80\x99s by the way that ad I must,\r\ncarrying home the change in her stocking! Clever little minx. I never\r\ntold her. Neat way she carries parcels too. Attract men, small thing\r\nlike that. Holding up her hand, shaking it, to let the blood flow back\r\nwhen it was red. Who did you learn that from? Nobody. Something the\r\nnurse taught me. O, don\xe2\x80\x99t they know! Three years old she was in front of\r\nMolly\xe2\x80\x99s dressingtable, just before we left Lombard street west. Me have\r\na nice pace. Mullingar. Who knows? Ways of the world. Young student.\r\nStraight on her pins anyway not like the other. Still she was game.\r\nLord, I am wet. Devil you are. Swell of her calf. Transparent stockings,\r\nstretched to breaking point. Not like that frump today. A. E. Rumpled\r\nstockings. Or the one in Grafton street. White. Wow! Beef to the heel.\r\n\r\nA monkey puzzle rocket burst, spluttering in darting crackles. Zrads and\r\nzrads, zrads, zrads. And Cissy and Tommy and Jacky ran out to see and\r\nEdy after with the pushcar and then Gerty beyond the curve of the rocks.\r\nWill she? Watch! Watch! See! Looked round. She smelt an onion. Darling,\r\nI saw, your. I saw all.\r\n\r\nLord!\r\n\r\nDid me good all the same. Off colour after Kiernan\xe2\x80\x99s, Dignam\xe2\x80\x99s. For\r\nthis relief much thanks. In Hamlet, that is. Lord! It was all things\r\ncombined. Excitement. When she leaned back, felt an ache at the butt\r\nof my tongue. Your head it simply swirls. He\xe2\x80\x99s right. Might have made a\r\nworse fool of myself however. Instead of talking about nothing. Then\r\nI will tell you all. Still it was a kind of language between us. It\r\ncouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be? No, Gerty they called her. Might be false name however like\r\nmy name and the address Dolphin\xe2\x80\x99s barn a blind.\r\n\r\n      Her maiden name was Jemina Brown\r\n      And she lived with her mother in Irishtown.\r\n\r\nPlace made me think of that I suppose. All tarred with the same brush.\r\nWiping pens in their stockings. But the ball rolled down to her as if\r\nit understood. Every bullet has its billet. Course I never could throw\r\nanything straight at school. Crooked as a ram\xe2\x80\x99s horn. Sad however\r\nbecause it lasts only a few years till they settle down to potwalloping\r\nand papa\xe2\x80\x99s pants will soon fit Willy and fuller\xe2\x80\x99s earth for the baby\r\nwhen they hold him out to do ah ah. No soft job. Saves them. Keeps\r\nthem out of harm\xe2\x80\x99s way. Nature. Washing child, washing corpse. Dignam.\r\nChildren\xe2\x80\x99s hands always round them. Cocoanut skulls, monkeys, not even\r\nclosed at first, sour milk in their swaddles and tainted curds. Oughtn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nto have given that child an empty teat to suck. Fill it up with wind.\r\nMrs Beaufoy, Purefoy. Must call to the hospital. Wonder is nurse Callan\r\nthere still. She used to look over some nights when Molly was in the\r\nCoffee Palace. That young doctor O\xe2\x80\x99Hare I noticed her brushing his coat.\r\nAnd Mrs Breen and Mrs Dignam once like that too, marriageable. Worst\r\nof all at night Mrs Duggan told me in the City Arms. Husband rolling in\r\ndrunk, stink of pub off him like a polecat. Have that in your nose in\r\nthe dark, whiff of stale boose. Then ask in the morning: was I drunk\r\nlast night? Bad policy however to fault the husband. Chickens come home\r\nto roost. They stick by one another like glue. Maybe the women\xe2\x80\x99s fault\r\nalso. That\xe2\x80\x99s where Molly can knock spots off them. It\xe2\x80\x99s the blood of the\r\nsouth. Moorish. Also the form, the figure. Hands felt for the opulent.\r\nJust compare for instance those others. Wife locked up at home, skeleton\r\nin the cupboard. Allow me to introduce my. Then they trot you out some\r\nkind of a nondescript, wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t know what to call her. Always see a\r\nfellow\xe2\x80\x99s weak point in his wife. Still there\xe2\x80\x99s destiny in it, falling\r\nin love. Have their own secrets between them. Chaps that would go to the\r\ndogs if some woman didn\xe2\x80\x99t take them in hand. Then little chits of girls,\r\nheight of a shilling in coppers, with little hubbies. As God made them\r\nhe matched them. Sometimes children turn out well enough. Twice nought\r\nmakes one. Or old rich chap of seventy and blushing bride. Marry in May\r\nand repent in December. This wet is very unpleasant. Stuck. Well the\r\nforeskin is not back. Better detach.\r\n\r\nOw!\r\n\r\nOther hand a sixfooter with a wifey up to his watchpocket. Long and\r\nthe short of it. Big he and little she. Very strange about my watch.\r\nWristwatches are always going wrong. Wonder is there any magnetic\r\ninfluence between the person because that was about the time he. Yes, I\r\nsuppose, at once. Cat\xe2\x80\x99s away, the mice will play. I remember looking\r\nin Pill lane. Also that now is magnetism. Back of everything magnetism.\r\nEarth for instance pulling this and being pulled. That causes movement.\r\nAnd time, well that\xe2\x80\x99s the time the movement takes. Then if one thing\r\nstopped the whole ghesabo would stop bit by bit. Because it\xe2\x80\x99s all\r\narranged. Magnetic needle tells you what\xe2\x80\x99s going on in the sun, the\r\nstars. Little piece of steel iron. When you hold out the fork. Come.\r\nCome. Tip. Woman and man that is. Fork and steel. Molly, he. Dress up\r\nand look and suggest and let you see and see more and defy you if you\xe2\x80\x99re\r\na man to see that and, like a sneeze coming, legs, look, look and if you\r\nhave any guts in you. Tip. Have to let fly.\r\n\r\nWonder how is she feeling in that region. Shame all put on before third\r\nperson. More put out about a hole in her stocking. Molly, her underjaw\r\nstuck out, head back, about the farmer in the ridingboots and spurs at\r\nthe horse show. And when the painters were in Lombard street west.\r\nFine voice that fellow had. How Giuglini began. Smell that I did. Like\r\nflowers. It was too. Violets. Came from the turpentine probably in the\r\npaint. Make their own use of everything. Same time doing it scraped her\r\nslipper on the floor so they wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t hear. But lots of them can\xe2\x80\x99t kick\r\nthe beam, I think. Keep that thing up for hours. Kind of a general all\r\nround over me and half down my back.\r\n\r\nWait. Hm. Hm. Yes. That\xe2\x80\x99s her perfume. Why she waved her hand. I leave\r\nyou this to think of me when I\xe2\x80\x99m far away on the pillow. What is it?\r\nHeliotrope? No. Hyacinth? Hm. Roses, I think. She\xe2\x80\x99d like scent of that\r\nkind. Sweet and cheap: soon sour. Why Molly likes opoponax. Suits her,\r\nwith a little jessamine mixed. Her high notes and her low notes. At the\r\ndance night she met him, dance of the hours. Heat brought it out. She\r\nwas wearing her black and it had the perfume of the time before. Good\r\nconductor, is it? Or bad? Light too. Suppose there\xe2\x80\x99s some connection.\r\nFor instance if you go into a cellar where it\xe2\x80\x99s dark. Mysterious thing\r\ntoo. Why did I smell it only now? Took its time in coming like herself,\r\nslow but sure. Suppose it\xe2\x80\x99s ever so many millions of tiny grains\r\nblown across. Yes, it is. Because those spice islands, Cinghalese this\r\nmorning, smell them leagues off. Tell you what it is. It\xe2\x80\x99s like a fine\r\nfine veil or web they have all over the skin, fine like what do you\r\ncall it gossamer, and they\xe2\x80\x99re always spinning it out of them, fine as\r\nanything, like rainbow colours without knowing it. Clings to everything\r\nshe takes off. Vamp of her stockings. Warm shoe. Stays. Drawers: little\r\nkick, taking them off. Byby till next time. Also the cat likes to sniff\r\nin her shift on the bed. Know her smell in a thousand. Bathwater too.\r\nReminds me of strawberries and cream. Wonder where it is really. There\r\nor the armpits or under the neck. Because you get it out of all holes\r\nand corners. Hyacinth perfume made of oil of ether or something.\r\nMuskrat. Bag under their tails. One grain pour off odour for years. Dogs\r\nat each other behind. Good evening. Evening. How do you sniff? Hm. Hm.\r\nVery well, thank you. Animals go by that. Yes now, look at it that way.\r\nWe\xe2\x80\x99re the same. Some women, instance, warn you off when they have their\r\nperiod. Come near. Then get a hogo you could hang your hat on. Like\r\nwhat? Potted herrings gone stale or. Boof! Please keep off the grass.\r\n\r\nPerhaps they get a man smell off us. What though? Cigary gloves long\r\nJohn had on his desk the other day. Breath? What you eat and drink gives\r\nthat. No. Mansmell, I mean. Must be connected with that because priests\r\nthat are supposed to be are different. Women buzz round it like flies\r\nround treacle. Railed off the altar get on to it at any cost. The tree\r\nof forbidden priest. O, father, will you? Let me be the first to. That\r\ndiffuses itself all through the body, permeates. Source of life. And\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s extremely curious the smell. Celery sauce. Let me.\r\n\r\nMr Bloom inserted his nose. Hm. Into the. Hm. Opening of his waistcoat.\r\nAlmonds or. No. Lemons it is. Ah no, that\xe2\x80\x99s the soap.\r\n\r\nO by the by that lotion. I knew there was something on my mind. Never\r\nwent back and the soap not paid. Dislike carrying bottles like that hag\r\nthis morning. Hynes might have paid me that three shillings. I could\r\nmention Meagher\xe2\x80\x99s just to remind him. Still if he works that paragraph.\r\nTwo and nine. Bad opinion of me he\xe2\x80\x99ll have. Call tomorrow. How much do\r\nI owe you? Three and nine? Two and nine, sir. Ah. Might stop him giving\r\ncredit another time. Lose your customers that way. Pubs do. Fellows run\r\nup a bill on the slate and then slinking around the back streets into\r\nsomewhere else.\r\n\r\nHere\xe2\x80\x99s this nobleman passed before. Blown in from the bay. Just went as\r\nfar as turn back. Always at home at dinnertime. Looks mangled out: had a\r\ngood tuck in. Enjoying nature now. Grace after meals. After supper walk\r\na mile. Sure he has a small bank balance somewhere, government sit. Walk\r\nafter him now make him awkward like those newsboys me today. Still you\r\nlearn something. See ourselves as others see us. So long as women don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nmock what matter? That\xe2\x80\x99s the way to find out. Ask yourself who is he\r\nnow. The Mystery Man on the Beach, prize titbit story by Mr Leopold\r\nBloom. Payment at the rate of one guinea per column. And that fellow\r\ntoday at the graveside in the brown macintosh. Corns on his kismet\r\nhowever. Healthy perhaps absorb all the. Whistle brings rain they say.\r\nMust be some somewhere. Salt in the Ormond damp. The body feels the\r\natmosphere. Old Betty\xe2\x80\x99s joints are on the rack. Mother Shipton\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nprophecy that is about ships around they fly in the twinkling. No. Signs\r\nof rain it is. The royal reader. And distant hills seem coming nigh.\r\n\r\nHowth. Bailey light. Two, four, six, eight, nine. See. Has to change or\r\nthey might think it a house. Wreckers. Grace Darling. People afraid of\r\nthe dark. Also glowworms, cyclists: lightingup time. Jewels diamonds\r\nflash better. Women. Light is a kind of reassuring. Not going to hurt\r\nyou. Better now of course than long ago. Country roads. Run you through\r\nthe small guts for nothing. Still two types there are you bob against.\r\nScowl or smile. Pardon! Not at all. Best time to spray plants too in\r\nthe shade after the sun. Some light still. Red rays are longest. Roygbiv\r\nVance taught us: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet. A\r\nstar I see. Venus? Can\xe2\x80\x99t tell yet. Two. When three it\xe2\x80\x99s night. Were\r\nthose nightclouds there all the time? Looks like a phantom ship. No.\r\nWait. Trees are they? An optical illusion. Mirage. Land of the setting\r\nsun this. Homerule sun setting in the southeast. My native land,\r\ngoodnight.\r\n\r\nDew falling. Bad for you, dear, to sit on that stone. Brings on white\r\nfluxions. Never have little baby then less he was big strong fight his\r\nway up through. Might get piles myself. Sticks too like a summer cold,\r\nsore on the mouth. Cut with grass or paper worst. Friction of the\r\nposition. Like to be that rock she sat on. O sweet little, you don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nknow how nice you looked. I begin to like them at that age. Green\r\napples. Grab at all that offer. Suppose it\xe2\x80\x99s the only time we cross\r\nlegs, seated. Also the library today: those girl graduates. Happy chairs\r\nunder them. But it\xe2\x80\x99s the evening influence. They feel all that. Open\r\nlike flowers, know their hours, sunflowers, Jerusalem artichokes, in\r\nballrooms, chandeliers, avenues under the lamps. Nightstock in Mat\r\nDillon\xe2\x80\x99s garden where I kissed her shoulder. Wish I had a full length\r\noilpainting of her then. June that was too I wooed. The year returns.\r\nHistory repeats itself. Ye crags and peaks I\xe2\x80\x99m with you once again.\r\nLife, love, voyage round your own little world. And now? Sad about her\r\nlame of course but must be on your guard not to feel too much pity. They\r\ntake advantage.\r\n\r\nAll quiet on Howth now. The distant hills seem. Where we. The\r\nrhododendrons. I am a fool perhaps. He gets the plums, and I the\r\nplumstones. Where I come in. All that old hill has seen. Names change:\r\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s all. Lovers: yum yum.\r\n\r\nTired I feel now. Will I get up? O wait. Drained all the manhood out of\r\nme, little wretch. She kissed me. Never again. My youth. Only once it\r\ncomes. Or hers. Take the train there tomorrow. No. Returning not the\r\nsame. Like kids your second visit to a house. The new I want. Nothing\r\nnew under the sun. Care of P. O. Dolphin\xe2\x80\x99s Barn. Are you not happy in\r\nyour? Naughty darling. At Dolphin\xe2\x80\x99s barn charades in Luke Doyle\xe2\x80\x99s house.\r\nMat Dillon and his bevy of daughters: Tiny, Atty, Floey, Maimy, Louy,\r\nHetty. Molly too. Eightyseven that was. Year before we. And the old\r\nmajor, partial to his drop of spirits. Curious she an only child, I an\r\nonly child. So it returns. Think you\xe2\x80\x99re escaping and run into yourself.\r\nLongest way round is the shortest way home. And just when he and she.\r\nCircus horse walking in a ring. Rip van Winkle we played. Rip: tear in\r\nHenny Doyle\xe2\x80\x99s overcoat. Van: breadvan delivering. Winkle: cockles and\r\nperiwinkles. Then I did Rip van Winkle coming back. She leaned on the\r\nsideboard watching. Moorish eyes. Twenty years asleep in Sleepy Hollow.\r\nAll changed. Forgotten. The young are old. His gun rusty from the dew.\r\n\r\nBa. What is that flying about? Swallow? Bat probably. Thinks I\xe2\x80\x99m a tree,\r\nso blind. Have birds no smell? Metempsychosis. They believed you could\r\nbe changed into a tree from grief. Weeping willow. Ba. There he goes.\r\nFunny little beggar. Wonder where he lives. Belfry up there. Very\r\nlikely. Hanging by his heels in the odour of sanctity. Bell scared him\r\nout, I suppose. Mass seems to be over. Could hear them all at it. Pray\r\nfor us. And pray for us. And pray for us. Good idea the repetition. Same\r\nthing with ads. Buy from us. And buy from us. Yes, there\xe2\x80\x99s the light in\r\nthe priest\xe2\x80\x99s house. Their frugal meal. Remember about the mistake in the\r\nvaluation when I was in Thom\xe2\x80\x99s. Twentyeight it is. Two houses they have.\r\nGabriel Conroy\xe2\x80\x99s brother is curate. Ba. Again. Wonder why they come out\r\nat night like mice. They\xe2\x80\x99re a mixed breed. Birds are like hopping mice.\r\nWhat frightens them, light or noise? Better sit still. All instinct\r\nlike the bird in drouth got water out of the end of a jar by throwing\r\nin pebbles. Like a little man in a cloak he is with tiny hands. Weeny\r\nbones. Almost see them shimmering, kind of a bluey white. Colours depend\r\non the light you see. Stare the sun for example like the eagle then look\r\nat a shoe see a blotch blob yellowish. Wants to stamp his trademark on\r\neverything. Instance, that cat this morning on the staircase. Colour of\r\nbrown turf. Say you never see them with three colours. Not true. That\r\nhalf tabbywhite tortoiseshell in the City Arms with the letter em on\r\nher forehead. Body fifty different colours. Howth a while ago amethyst.\r\nGlass flashing. That\xe2\x80\x99s how that wise man what\xe2\x80\x99s his name with the\r\nburning glass. Then the heather goes on fire. It can\xe2\x80\x99t be tourists\xe2\x80\x99\r\nmatches. What? Perhaps the sticks dry rub together in the wind and\r\nlight. Or broken bottles in the furze act as a burning glass in the sun.\r\nArchimedes. I have it! My memory\xe2\x80\x99s not so bad.\r\n\r\nBa. Who knows what they\xe2\x80\x99re always flying for. Insects? That bee last\r\nweek got into the room playing with his shadow on the ceiling. Might\r\nbe the one bit me, come back to see. Birds too. Never find out. Or what\r\nthey say. Like our small talk. And says she and says he. Nerve they have\r\nto fly over the ocean and back. Lots must be killed in storms, telegraph\r\nwires. Dreadful life sailors have too. Big brutes of oceangoing steamers\r\nfloundering along in the dark, lowing out like seacows. Faugh a\r\nballagh! Out of that, bloody curse to you! Others in vessels, bit of a\r\nhandkerchief sail, pitched about like snuff at a wake when the stormy\r\nwinds do blow. Married too. Sometimes away for years at the ends of the\r\nearth somewhere. No ends really because it\xe2\x80\x99s round. Wife in every port\r\nthey say. She has a good job if she minds it till Johnny comes marching\r\nhome again. If ever he does. Smelling the tail end of ports. How can\r\nthey like the sea? Yet they do. The anchor\xe2\x80\x99s weighed. Off he sails with\r\na scapular or a medal on him for luck. Well. And the tephilim no what\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nthis they call it poor papa\xe2\x80\x99s father had on his door to touch. That\r\nbrought us out of the land of Egypt and into the house of bondage.\r\nSomething in all those superstitions because when you go out never know\r\nwhat dangers. Hanging on to a plank or astride of a beam for grim life,\r\nlifebelt round him, gulping salt water, and that\xe2\x80\x99s the last of his nibs\r\ntill the sharks catch hold of him. Do fish ever get seasick?\r\n\r\nThen you have a beautiful calm without a cloud, smooth sea, placid,\r\ncrew and cargo in smithereens, Davy Jones\xe2\x80\x99 locker, moon looking down so\r\npeaceful. Not my fault, old cockalorum.\r\n\r\nA last lonely candle wandered up the sky from Mirus bazaar in search of\r\nfunds for Mercer\xe2\x80\x99s hospital and broke, drooping, and shed a cluster\r\nof violet but one white stars. They floated, fell: they faded. The\r\nshepherd\xe2\x80\x99s hour: the hour of folding: hour of tryst. From house to\r\nhouse, giving his everwelcome double knock, went the nine o\xe2\x80\x99clock\r\npostman, the glowworm\xe2\x80\x99s lamp at his belt gleaming here and there through\r\nthe laurel hedges. And among the five young trees a hoisted lintstock\r\nlit the lamp at Leahy\xe2\x80\x99s terrace. By screens of lighted windows, by equal\r\ngardens a shrill voice went crying, wailing: Evening Telegraph, stop\r\npress edition! Result of the Gold Cup races! and from the door of\r\nDignam\xe2\x80\x99s house a boy ran out and called. Twittering the bat flew here,\r\nflew there. Far out over the sands the coming surf crept, grey. Howth\r\nsettled for slumber, tired of long days, of yumyum rhododendrons (he was\r\nold) and felt gladly the night breeze lift, ruffle his fell of ferns.\r\nHe lay but opened a red eye unsleeping, deep and slowly breathing,\r\nslumberous but awake. And far on Kish bank the anchored lightship\r\ntwinkled, winked at Mr Bloom.\r\n\r\nLife those chaps out there must have, stuck in the same spot. Irish\r\nLights board. Penance for their sins. Coastguards too. Rocket and\r\nbreeches buoy and lifeboat. Day we went out for the pleasure cruise in\r\nthe Erin\xe2\x80\x99s King, throwing them the sack of old papers. Bears in the zoo.\r\nFilthy trip. Drunkards out to shake up their livers. Puking overboard\r\nto feed the herrings. Nausea. And the women, fear of God in their faces.\r\nMilly, no sign of funk. Her blue scarf loose, laughing. Don\xe2\x80\x99t know what\r\ndeath is at that age. And then their stomachs clean. But being lost they\r\nfear. When we hid behind the tree at Crumlin. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to. Mamma!\r\nMamma! Babes in the wood. Frightening them with masks too. Throwing them\r\nup in the air to catch them. I\xe2\x80\x99ll murder you. Is it only half fun? Or\r\nchildren playing battle. Whole earnest. How can people aim guns at each\r\nother. Sometimes they go off. Poor kids! Only troubles wildfire and\r\nnettlerash. Calomel purge I got her for that. After getting better\r\nasleep with Molly. Very same teeth she has. What do they love? Another\r\nthemselves? But the morning she chased her with the umbrella. Perhaps so\r\nas not to hurt. I felt her pulse. Ticking. Little hand it was: now big.\r\nDearest Papli. All that the hand says when you touch. Loved to count\r\nmy waistcoat buttons. Her first stays I remember. Made me laugh to see.\r\nLittle paps to begin with. Left one is more sensitive, I think. Mine\r\ntoo. Nearer the heart? Padding themselves out if fat is in fashion. Her\r\ngrowing pains at night, calling, wakening me. Frightened she was when\r\nher nature came on her first. Poor child! Strange moment for the mother\r\ntoo. Brings back her girlhood. Gibraltar. Looking from Buena Vista.\r\nO\xe2\x80\x99Hara\xe2\x80\x99s tower. The seabirds screaming. Old Barbary ape that gobbled all\r\nhis family. Sundown, gunfire for the men to cross the lines. Looking\r\nout over the sea she told me. Evening like this, but clear, no clouds.\r\nI always thought I\xe2\x80\x99d marry a lord or a rich gentleman coming with\r\na private yacht. Buenas noches, se\xc3\xb1orita. El hombre ama la muchacha\r\nhermosa. Why me? Because you were so foreign from the others.\r\n\r\nBetter not stick here all night like a limpet. This weather makes you\r\ndull. Must be getting on for nine by the light. Go home. Too late for\r\nLeah, Lily of Killarney. No. Might be still up. Call to the hospital\r\nto see. Hope she\xe2\x80\x99s over. Long day I\xe2\x80\x99ve had. Martha, the bath, funeral,\r\nhouse of Keyes, museum with those goddesses, Dedalus\xe2\x80\x99 song. Then that\r\nbawler in Barney Kiernan\xe2\x80\x99s. Got my own back there. Drunken ranters what\r\nI said about his God made him wince. Mistake to hit back. Or? No.\r\nOught to go home and laugh at themselves. Always want to be swilling in\r\ncompany. Afraid to be alone like a child of two. Suppose he hit me. Look\r\nat it other way round. Not so bad then. Perhaps not to hurt he meant.\r\nThree cheers for Israel. Three cheers for the sister-in-law he hawked\r\nabout, three fangs in her mouth. Same style of beauty. Particularly nice\r\nold party for a cup of tea. The sister of the wife of the wild man of\r\nBorneo has just come to town. Imagine that in the early morning at close\r\nrange. Everyone to his taste as Morris said when he kissed the cow. But\r\nDignam\xe2\x80\x99s put the boots on it. Houses of mourning so depressing because\r\nyou never know. Anyhow she wants the money. Must call to those Scottish\r\nWidows as I promised. Strange name. Takes it for granted we\xe2\x80\x99re going to\r\npop off first. That widow on Monday was it outside Cramer\xe2\x80\x99s that\r\nlooked at me. Buried the poor husband but progressing favourably on\r\nthe premium. Her widow\xe2\x80\x99s mite. Well? What do you expect her to do? Must\r\nwheedle her way along. Widower I hate to see. Looks so forlorn. Poor man\r\nO\xe2\x80\x99Connor wife and five children poisoned by mussels here. The sewage.\r\nHopeless. Some good matronly woman in a porkpie hat to mother him. Take\r\nhim in tow, platter face and a large apron. Ladies\xe2\x80\x99 grey flannelette\r\nbloomers, three shillings a pair, astonishing bargain. Plain and loved,\r\nloved for ever, they say. Ugly: no woman thinks she is. Love, lie and be\r\nhandsome for tomorrow we die. See him sometimes walking about trying to\r\nfind out who played the trick. U.P.: up. Fate that is. He, not me. Also\r\na shop often noticed. Curse seems to dog it. Dreamt last night? Wait.\r\nSomething confused. She had red slippers on. Turkish. Wore the breeches.\r\nSuppose she does? Would I like her in pyjamas? Damned hard to answer.\r\nNannetti\xe2\x80\x99s gone. Mailboat. Near Holyhead by now. Must nail that ad\r\nof Keyes\xe2\x80\x99s. Work Hynes and Crawford. Petticoats for Molly. She has\r\nsomething to put in them. What\xe2\x80\x99s that? Might be money.\r\n\r\nMr Bloom stooped and turned over a piece of paper on the strand. He\r\nbrought it near his eyes and peered. Letter? No. Can\xe2\x80\x99t read. Better go.\r\nBetter. I\xe2\x80\x99m tired to move. Page of an old copybook. All those holes and\r\npebbles. Who could count them? Never know what you find. Bottle with\r\nstory of a treasure in it, thrown from a wreck. Parcels post. Children\r\nalways want to throw things in the sea. Trust? Bread cast on the waters.\r\nWhat\xe2\x80\x99s this? Bit of stick.\r\n\r\nO! Exhausted that female has me. Not so young now. Will she come here\r\ntomorrow? Wait for her somewhere for ever. Must come back. Murderers do.\r\nWill I?\r\n\r\nMr Bloom with his stick gently vexed the thick sand at his foot. Write a\r\nmessage for her. Might remain. What?\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\nSome flatfoot tramp on it in the morning. Useless. Washed away. Tide\r\ncomes here. Saw a pool near her foot. Bend, see my face there, dark\r\nmirror, breathe on it, stirs. All these rocks with lines and scars and\r\nletters. O, those transparent! Besides they don\xe2\x80\x99t know. What is the\r\nmeaning of that other world. I called you naughty boy because I do not\r\nlike.\r\n\r\nAM. A.\r\n\r\nNo room. Let it go.\r\n\r\nMr Bloom effaced the letters with his slow boot. Hopeless thing sand.\r\nNothing grows in it. All fades. No fear of big vessels coming up here.\r\nExcept Guinness\xe2\x80\x99s barges. Round the Kish in eighty days. Done half by\r\ndesign.\r\n\r\nHe flung his wooden pen away. The stick fell in silted sand, stuck. Now\r\nif you were trying to do that for a week on end you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t. Chance.\r\nWe\xe2\x80\x99ll never meet again. But it was lovely. Goodbye, dear. Thanks. Made\r\nme feel so young.\r\n\r\nShort snooze now if I had. Must be near nine. Liverpool boat long gone.\r\nNot even the smoke. And she can do the other. Did too. And Belfast. I\r\nwon\xe2\x80\x99t go. Race there, race back to Ennis. Let him. Just close my eyes\r\na moment. Won\xe2\x80\x99t sleep, though. Half dream. It never comes the same. Bat\r\nagain. No harm in him. Just a few.\r\n\r\nO sweety all your little girlwhite up I saw dirty bracegirdle made me do\r\nlove sticky we two naughty Grace darling she him half past the bed met\r\nhim pike hoses frillies for Raoul de perfume your wife black hair heave\r\nunder embon se\xc3\xb1orita young eyes Mulvey plump bubs me breadvan Winkle red\r\nslippers she rusty sleep wander years of dreams return tail end Agendath\r\nswoony lovey showed me her next year in drawers return next in her next\r\nher next.\r\n\r\nA bat flew.

Certainly in every public work which\r\nin it anything of gravity contains preparation should be with importance\r\ncommensurate and therefore a plan was by them adopted (whether by having\r\npreconsidered or as the maturation of experience it is difficult in\r\nbeing said which the discrepant opinions of subsequent inquirers are not\r\nup to the present congrued to render manifest) whereby maternity was so\r\nfar from all accident possibility removed that whatever care the patient\r\nin that allhardest of woman hour chiefly required and not solely for the\r\ncopiously opulent but also for her who not being sufficiently moneyed\r\nscarcely and often not even scarcely could subsist valiantly and for an\r\ninconsiderable emolument was provided.\r\n\r\nTo her nothing already then and thenceforward was anyway able to be\r\nmolestful for this chiefly felt all citizens except with proliferent\r\nmothers prosperity at all not to can be and as they had received\r\neternity gods mortals generation to befit them her beholding, when the\r\ncase was so hoving itself, parturient in vehicle thereward carrying\r\ndesire immense among all one another was impelling on of her to be\r\nreceived into that domicile.

Within womb won he worship. Whatever in that\r\none case done commodiously done was. A couch by midwives attended with\r\nwholesome food reposeful, cleanest swaddles as though forthbringing were\r\nnow done and by wise foresight set: but to this no less of what drugs\r\nthere is need and surgical implements which are pertaining to her\r\ncase not omitting aspect of all very distracting spectacles in various\r\nlatitudes by our terrestrial orb offered together with images, divine\r\nand human, the cogitation of which by sejunct females is to tumescence\r\nconducive or eases issue in the high sunbright wellbuilt fair home of\r\nmothers when, ostensibly far gone and reproductitive, it is come by her\r\nthereto to lie in, her term up.\r\n\r\nSome man that wayfaring was stood by housedoor at night\xe2\x80\x99s oncoming. Of\r\nIsrael\xe2\x80\x99s folk was that man that on earth wandering far had fared. Stark\r\nruth of man his errand that him lone led till that house.\r\n\r\nOf that house A. Horne is lord. Seventy beds keeps he there teeming\r\nmothers are wont that they lie for to thole and bring forth bairns hale\r\nso God\xe2\x80\x99s angel to Mary quoth. Watchers tway there walk, white sisters\r\nin ward sleepless. Smarts they still, sickness soothing: in twelve moons\r\nthrice an hundred. Truest bedthanes they twain are, for Horne holding\r\nwariest ward.\r\n\r\nIn ward wary the watcher hearing come that man mildhearted eft rising\r\nwith swire ywimpled to him her gate wide undid. Lo, levin leaping\r\nlightens in eyeblink Ireland\xe2\x80\x99s westward welkin. Full she drad that\r\nGod the Wreaker all mankind would fordo with water for his evil sins.\r\nChrist\xe2\x80\x99s rood made she on breastbone and him drew that he would rathe\r\ninfare under her thatch. That man her will wotting worthful went in\r\nHorne\xe2\x80\x99s house.\r\n\r\nLoth to irk in Horne\xe2\x80\x99s hall hat holding the seeker stood. On her stow he\r\nere was living with dear wife and lovesome daughter that then over land\r\nand seafloor nine years had long outwandered. Once her in townhithe\r\nmeeting he to her bow had not doffed. Her to forgive now he craved with\r\ngood ground of her allowed that that of him swiftseen face, hers, so\r\nyoung then had looked. Light swift her eyes kindled, bloom of blushes\r\nhis word winning.\r\n\r\nAs her eyes then ongot his weeds swart therefor sorrow she feared. Glad\r\nafter she was that ere adread was. Her he asked if O\xe2\x80\x99Hare Doctor tidings\r\nsent from far coast and she with grameful sigh him answered that O\xe2\x80\x99Hare\r\nDoctor in heaven was. Sad was the man that word to hear that him so\r\nheavied in bowels ruthful. All she there told him, ruing death for\r\nfriend so young, algate sore unwilling God\xe2\x80\x99s rightwiseness to withsay.\r\nShe said that he had a fair sweet death through God His goodness with\r\nmasspriest to be shriven, holy housel and sick men\xe2\x80\x99s oil to his limbs.\r\nThe man then right earnest asked the nun of which death the dead man was\r\ndied and the nun answered him and said that he was died in Mona Island\r\nthrough bellycrab three year agone come Childermas and she prayed to God\r\nthe Allruthful to have his dear soul in his undeathliness. He heard her\r\nsad words, in held hat sad staring. So stood they there both awhile in\r\nwanhope sorrowing one with other.\r\n\r\nTherefore, everyman, look to that last end that is thy death and the\r\ndust that gripeth on every man that is born of woman for as he came\r\nnaked forth from his mother\xe2\x80\x99s womb so naked shall he wend him at the\r\nlast for to go as he came.\r\n\r\nThe man that was come in to the house then spoke to the nursingwoman and\r\nhe asked her how it fared with the woman that lay there in childbed.\r\nThe nursingwoman answered him and said that that woman was in throes\r\nnow full three days and that it would be a hard birth unneth to bear\r\nbut that now in a little it would be. She said thereto that she had\r\nseen many births of women but never was none so hard as was that woman\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbirth. Then she set it all forth to him for because she knew the man\r\nthat time was had lived nigh that house. The man hearkened to her words\r\nfor he felt with wonder women\xe2\x80\x99s woe in the travail that they have of\r\nmotherhood and he wondered to look on her face that was a fair face for\r\nany man to see but yet was she left after long years a handmaid. Nine\r\ntwelve bloodflows chiding her childless.\r\n\r\nAnd whiles they spake the door of the castle was opened and there nighed\r\nthem a mickle noise as of many that sat there at meat. And there came\r\nagainst the place as they stood a young learningknight yclept Dixon. And\r\nthe traveller Leopold was couth to him sithen it had happed that they\r\nhad had ado each with other in the house of misericord where this\r\nlearningknight lay by cause the traveller Leopold came there to be\r\nhealed for he was sore wounded in his breast by a spear wherewith a\r\nhorrible and dreadful dragon was smitten him for which he did do make\r\na salve of volatile salt and chrism as much as he might suffice. And he\r\nsaid now that he should go in to that castle for to make merry with\r\nthem that were there. And the traveller Leopold said that he should go\r\notherwhither for he was a man of cautels and a subtile. Also the lady\r\nwas of his avis and repreved the learningknight though she trowed well\r\nthat the traveller had said thing that was false for his subtility. But\r\nthe learningknight would not hear say nay nor do her mandement ne have\r\nhim in aught contrarious to his list and he said how it was a marvellous\r\ncastle. And the traveller Leopold went into the castle for to rest him\r\nfor a space being sore of limb after many marches environing in divers\r\nlands and sometime venery.\r\n\r\nAnd in the castle was set a board that was of the birchwood of Finlandy\r\nand it was upheld by four dwarfmen of that country but they durst not\r\nmove more for enchantment. And on this board were frightful swords and\r\nknives that are made in a great cavern by swinking demons out of white\r\nflames that they fix then in the horns of buffalos and stags that there\r\nabound marvellously. And there were vessels that are wrought by magic of\r\nMahound out of seasand and the air by a warlock with his breath that he\r\nblases in to them like to bubbles. And full fair cheer and rich was on\r\nthe board that no wight could devise a fuller ne richer. And there was\r\na vat of silver that was moved by craft to open in the which lay strange\r\nfishes withouten heads though misbelieving men nie that this be possible\r\nthing without they see it natheless they are so. And these fishes lie\r\nin an oily water brought there from Portugal land because of the fatness\r\nthat therein is like to the juices of the olivepress. And also it was\r\na marvel to see in that castle how by magic they make a compost out of\r\nfecund wheatkidneys out of Chaldee that by aid of certain angry spirits\r\nthat they do in to it swells up wondrously like to a vast mountain. And\r\nthey teach the serpents there to entwine themselves up on long sticks\r\nout of the ground and of the scales of these serpents they brew out a\r\nbrewage like to mead.\r\n\r\nAnd the learning knight let pour for childe Leopold a draught and halp\r\nthereto the while all they that were there drank every each. And childe\r\nLeopold did up his beaver for to pleasure him and took apertly somewhat\r\nin amity for he never drank no manner of mead which he then put by and\r\nanon full privily he voided the more part in his neighbour glass and\r\nhis neighbour nist not of this wile. And he sat down in that castle with\r\nthem for to rest him there awhile. Thanked be Almighty God.\r\n\r\nThis meanwhile this good sister stood by the door and begged them at the\r\nreverence of Jesu our alther liege Lord to leave their wassailing for\r\nthere was above one quick with child, a gentle dame, whose time hied\r\nfast. Sir Leopold heard on the upfloor cry on high and he wondered what\r\ncry that it was whether of child or woman and I marvel, said he, that it\r\nbe not come or now. Meseems it dureth overlong. And he was ware and saw\r\na franklin that hight Lenehan on that side the table that was older than\r\nany of the tother and for that they both were knights virtuous in the\r\none emprise and eke by cause that he was elder he spoke to him full\r\ngently. But, said he, or it be long too she will bring forth by God His\r\nbounty and have joy of her childing for she hath waited marvellous long.\r\nAnd the franklin that had drunken said, Expecting each moment to be her\r\nnext. Also he took the cup that stood tofore him for him needed never\r\nnone asking nor desiring of him to drink and, Now drink, said he, fully\r\ndelectably, and he quaffed as far as he might to their both\xe2\x80\x99s health for\r\nhe was a passing good man of his lustiness. And sir Leopold that was the\r\ngoodliest guest that ever sat in scholars\xe2\x80\x99 hall and that was the meekest\r\nman and the kindest that ever laid husbandly hand under hen and that was\r\nthe very truest knight of the world one that ever did minion service\r\nto lady gentle pledged him courtly in the cup. Woman\xe2\x80\x99s woe with wonder\r\npondering.\r\n\r\nNow let us speak of that fellowship that was there to the intent to be\r\ndrunken an they might. There was a sort of scholars along either side\r\nthe board, that is to wit, Dixon yclept junior of saint Mary Merciable\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwith other his fellows Lynch and Madden, scholars of medicine, and the\r\nfranklin that hight Lenehan and one from Alba Longa, one Crotthers, and\r\nyoung Stephen that had mien of a frere that was at head of the board\r\nand Costello that men clepen Punch Costello all long of a mastery of\r\nhim erewhile gested (and of all them, reserved young Stephen, he was the\r\nmost drunken that demanded still of more mead) and beside the meek sir\r\nLeopold. But on young Malachi they waited for that he promised to have\r\ncome and such as intended to no goodness said how he had broke his avow.\r\nAnd sir Leopold sat with them for he bore fast friendship to sir Simon\r\nand to this his son young Stephen and for that his languor becalmed him\r\nthere after longest wanderings insomuch as they feasted him for that\r\ntime in the honourablest manner. Ruth red him, love led on with will to\r\nwander, loth to leave.\r\n\r\nFor they were right witty scholars. And he heard their aresouns each gen\r\nother as touching birth and righteousness, young Madden maintaining that\r\nput such case it were hard the wife to die (for so it had fallen out a\r\nmatter of some year agone with a woman of Eblana in Horne\xe2\x80\x99s house that\r\nnow was trespassed out of this world and the self night next before her\r\ndeath all leeches and pothecaries had taken counsel of her case). And\r\nthey said farther she should live because in the beginning, they said,\r\nthe woman should bring forth in pain and wherefore they that were of\r\nthis imagination affirmed how young Madden had said truth for he had\r\nconscience to let her die. And not few and of these was young Lynch\r\nwere in doubt that the world was now right evil governed as it was never\r\nother howbeit the mean people believed it otherwise but the law nor his\r\njudges did provide no remedy. A redress God grant. This was scant said\r\nbut all cried with one acclaim nay, by our Virgin Mother, the wife\r\nshould live and the babe to die. In colour whereof they waxed hot\r\nupon that head what with argument and what for their drinking but the\r\nfranklin Lenehan was prompt each when to pour them ale so that at the\r\nleast way mirth might not lack. Then young Madden showed all the whole\r\naffair and said how that she was dead and how for holy religion sake by\r\nrede of palmer and bedesman and for a vow he had made to Saint Ultan of\r\nArbraccan her goodman husband would not let her death whereby they were\r\nall wondrous grieved. To whom young Stephen had these words following:\r\nMurmur, sirs, is eke oft among lay folk. Both babe and parent now\r\nglorify their Maker, the one in limbo gloom, the other in purgefire.\r\nBut, gramercy, what of those Godpossibled souls that we nightly\r\nimpossibilise, which is the sin against the Holy Ghost, Very God, Lord\r\nand Giver of Life? For, sirs, he said, our lust is brief. We are means\r\nto those small creatures within us and nature has other ends than we.\r\nThen said Dixon junior to Punch Costello wist he what ends. But he had\r\novermuch drunken and the best word he could have of him was that he\r\nwould ever dishonest a woman whoso she were or wife or maid or leman if\r\nit so fortuned him to be delivered of his spleen of lustihead. Whereat\r\nCrotthers of Alba Longa sang young Malachi\xe2\x80\x99s praise of that beast the\r\nunicorn how once in the millennium he cometh by his horn, the other all\r\nthis while, pricked forward with their jibes wherewith they did malice\r\nhim, witnessing all and several by saint Foutinus his engines that\r\nhe was able to do any manner of thing that lay in man to do. Thereat\r\nlaughed they all right jocundly only young Stephen and sir Leopold which\r\nnever durst laugh too open by reason of a strange humour which he would\r\nnot bewray and also for that he rued for her that bare whoso she might\r\nbe or wheresoever. Then spake young Stephen orgulous of mother Church\r\nthat would cast him out of her bosom, of law of canons, of Lilith,\r\npatron of abortions, of bigness wrought by wind of seeds of brightness\r\nor by potency of vampires mouth to mouth or, as Virgilius saith, by the\r\ninfluence of the occident or by the reek of moonflower or an she\r\nlie with a woman which her man has but lain with, effectu secuto, or\r\nperadventure in her bath according to the opinions of Averroes and Moses\r\nMaimonides. He said also how at the end of the second month a human soul\r\nwas infused and how in all our holy mother foldeth ever souls for God\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngreater glory whereas that earthly mother which was but a dam to bear\r\nbeastly should die by canon for so saith he that holdeth the fisherman\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nseal, even that blessed Peter on which rock was holy church for all ages\r\nfounded. All they bachelors then asked of sir Leopold would he in like\r\ncase so jeopard her person as risk life to save life. A wariness of\r\nmind he would answer as fitted all and, laying hand to jaw, he said\r\ndissembling, as his wont was, that as it was informed him, who had ever\r\nloved the art of physic as might a layman, and agreeing also with his\r\nexperience of so seldomseen an accident it was good for that mother\r\nChurch belike at one blow had birth and death pence and in such sort\r\ndeliverly he scaped their questions. That is truth, pardy, said Dixon,\r\nand, or I err, a pregnant word. Which hearing young Stephen was a\r\nmarvellous glad man and he averred that he who stealeth from the poor\r\nlendeth to the Lord for he was of a wild manner when he was drunken and\r\nthat he was now in that taking it appeared eftsoons.\r\n\r\nBut sir Leopold was passing grave maugre his word by cause he still had\r\npity of the terrorcausing shrieking of shrill women in their labour\r\nand as he was minded of his good lady Marion that had borne him an only\r\nmanchild which on his eleventh day on live had died and no man of art\r\ncould save so dark is destiny. And she was wondrous stricken of heart\r\nfor that evil hap and for his burial did him on a fair corselet of\r\nlamb\xe2\x80\x99s wool, the flower of the flock, lest he might perish utterly and\r\nlie akeled (for it was then about the midst of the winter) and now sir\r\nLeopold that had of his body no manchild for an heir looked upon him his\r\nfriend\xe2\x80\x99s son and was shut up in sorrow for his forepassed happiness and\r\nas sad as he was that him failed a son of such gentle courage (for all\r\naccounted him of real parts) so grieved he also in no less measure\r\nfor young Stephen for that he lived riotously with those wastrels and\r\nmurdered his goods with whores.\r\n\r\nAbout that present time young Stephen filled all cups that stood empty\r\nso as there remained but little mo if the prudenter had not shadowed\r\ntheir approach from him that still plied it very busily who, praying for\r\nthe intentions of the sovereign pontiff, he gave them for a pledge the\r\nvicar of Christ which also as he said is vicar of Bray. Now drink we,\r\nquod he, of this mazer and quaff ye this mead which is not indeed parcel\r\nof my body but my soul\xe2\x80\x99s bodiment. Leave ye fraction of bread to them\r\nthat live by bread alone. Be not afeard neither for any want for this\r\nwill comfort more than the other will dismay. See ye here. And he showed\r\nthem glistering coins of the tribute and goldsmith notes the worth of\r\ntwo pound nineteen shilling that he had, he said, for a song which he\r\nwrit. They all admired to see the foresaid riches in such dearth of\r\nmoney as was herebefore. His words were then these as followeth: Know\r\nall men, he said, time\xe2\x80\x99s ruins build eternity\xe2\x80\x99s mansions. What means\r\nthis? Desire\xe2\x80\x99s wind blasts the thorntree but after it becomes from a\r\nbramblebush to be a rose upon the rood of time. Mark me now. In woman\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwomb word is made flesh but in the spirit of the maker all flesh\r\nthat passes becomes the word that shall not pass away. This is the\r\npostcreation. Omnis caro ad te veniet. No question but her name is\r\npuissant who aventried the dear corse of our Agenbuyer, Healer and Herd,\r\nour mighty mother and mother most venerable and Bernardus saith aptly\r\nthat She hath an omnipotentiam deiparae supplicem, that is to wit, an\r\nalmightiness of petition because she is the second Eve and she won\r\nus, saith Augustine too, whereas that other, our grandam, which we are\r\nlinked up with by successive anastomosis of navelcords sold us all,\r\nseed, breed and generation, for a penny pippin. But here is the matter\r\nnow. Or she knew him, that second I say, and was but creature of her\r\ncreature, vergine madre, figlia di tuo figlio, or she knew him not and\r\nthen stands she in the one denial or ignorancy with Peter Piscator who\r\nlives in the house that Jack built and with Joseph the joiner patron of\r\nthe happy demise of all unhappy marriages, parceque M. L\xc3\xa9o Taxil nous\r\na dit que qui l\xe2\x80\x99avait mise dans cette fichue position c\xe2\x80\x99\xc3\xa9tait le\r\nsacr\xc3\xa9 pigeon, ventre de Dieu! Entweder transubstantiality oder\r\nconsubstantiality but in no case subsubstantiality. And all cried out\r\nupon it for a very scurvy word. A pregnancy without joy, he said, a\r\nbirth without pangs, a body without blemish, a belly without bigness.\r\nLet the lewd with faith and fervour worship. With will will we\r\nwithstand, withsay.\r\n\r\nHereupon Punch Costello dinged with his fist upon the board and would\r\nsing a bawdy catch Staboo Stabella about a wench that was put in pod of\r\na jolly swashbuckler in Almany which he did straightways now attack:\r\nThe first three months she was not well, Staboo, when here nurse Quigley\r\nfrom the door angerly bid them hist ye should shame you nor was it\r\nnot meet as she remembered them being her mind was to have all orderly\r\nagainst lord Andrew came for because she was jealous that no gasteful\r\nturmoil might shorten the honour of her guard. It was an ancient and\r\na sad matron of a sedate look and christian walking, in habit dun\r\nbeseeming her megrims and wrinkled visage, nor did her hortative want of\r\nit effect for incontinently Punch Costello was of them all embraided and\r\nthey reclaimed the churl with civil rudeness some and shaked him with\r\nmenace of blandishments others whiles they all chode with him, a murrain\r\nseize the dolt, what a devil he would be at, thou chuff, thou puny, thou\r\ngot in peasestraw, thou losel, thou chitterling, thou spawn of a rebel,\r\nthou dykedropt, thou abortion thou, to shut up his drunken drool out\r\nof that like a curse of God ape, the good sir Leopold that had for his\r\ncognisance the flower of quiet, margerain gentle, advising also the\r\ntime\xe2\x80\x99s occasion as most sacred and most worthy to be most sacred. In\r\nHorne\xe2\x80\x99s house rest should reign.\r\n\r\nTo be short this passage was scarce by when Master Dixon of Mary in\r\nEccles, goodly grinning, asked young Stephen what was the reason why he\r\nhad not cided to take friar\xe2\x80\x99s vows and he answered him obedience in the\r\nwomb, chastity in the tomb but involuntary poverty all his days. Master\r\nLenehan at this made return that he had heard of those nefarious deeds\r\nand how, as he heard hereof counted, he had besmirched the lily virtue\r\nof a confiding female which was corruption of minors and they all\r\nintershowed it too, waxing merry and toasting to his fathership. But he\r\nsaid very entirely it was clean contrary to their suppose for he was\r\nthe eternal son and ever virgin. Thereat mirth grew in them the more and\r\nthey rehearsed to him his curious rite of wedlock for the disrobing and\r\ndeflowering of spouses, as the priests use in Madagascar island, she\r\nto be in guise of white and saffron, her groom in white and grain, with\r\nburning of nard and tapers, on a bridebed while clerks sung kyries and\r\nthe anthem Ut novetur sexus omnis corporis mysterium till she was\r\nthere unmaided. He gave them then a much admirable hymen minim by those\r\ndelicate poets Master John Fletcher and Master Francis Beaumont that is\r\nin their Maid\xe2\x80\x99s Tragedy that was writ for a like twining of lovers: To\r\nbed, to bed was the burden of it to be played with accompanable concent\r\nupon the virginals. An exquisite dulcet epithalame of most mollificative\r\nsuadency for juveniles amatory whom the odoriferous flambeaus of the\r\nparanymphs have escorted to the quadrupedal proscenium of connubial\r\ncommunion. Well met they were, said Master Dixon, joyed, but, harkee,\r\nyoung sir, better were they named Beau Mount and Lecher for, by my\r\ntroth, of such a mingling much might come. Young Stephen said indeed to\r\nhis best remembrance they had but the one doxy between them and she of\r\nthe stews to make shift with in delights amorous for life ran very high\r\nin those days and the custom of the country approved with it. Greater\r\nlove than this, he said, no man hath that a man lay down his wife for\r\nhis friend. Go thou and do likewise. Thus, or words to that effect,\r\nsaith Zarathustra, sometime regius professor of French letters to the\r\nuniversity of Oxtail nor breathed there ever that man to whom mankind\r\nwas more beholden. Bring a stranger within thy tower it will go hard but\r\nthou wilt have the secondbest bed. Orate, fratres, pro memetipso. And\r\nall the people shall say, Amen. Remember, Erin, thy generations and\r\nthy days of old, how thou settedst little by me and by my word and\r\nbroughtedst in a stranger to my gates to commit fornication in my\r\nsight and to wax fat and kick like Jeshurum. Therefore hast thou\r\nsinned against my light and hast made me, thy lord, to be the slave of\r\nservants. Return, return, Clan Milly: forget me not, O Milesian. Why\r\nhast thou done this abomination before me that thou didst spurn me for\r\na merchant of jalaps and didst deny me to the Roman and to the Indian of\r\ndark speech with whom thy daughters did lie luxuriously? Look forth now,\r\nmy people, upon the land of behest, even from Horeb and from Nebo and\r\nfrom Pisgah and from the Horns of Hatten unto a land flowing with milk\r\nand money. But thou hast suckled me with a bitter milk: my moon and my\r\nsun thou hast quenched for ever. And thou hast left me alone for ever\r\nin the dark ways of my bitterness: and with a kiss of ashes hast thou\r\nkissed my mouth. This tenebrosity of the interior, he proceeded to say,\r\nhath not been illumined by the wit of the septuagint nor so much as\r\nmentioned for the Orient from on high which brake hell\xe2\x80\x99s gates visited a\r\ndarkness that was foraneous. Assuefaction minorates atrocities (as Tully\r\nsaith of his darling Stoics) and Hamlet his father showeth the prince no\r\nblister of combustion. The adiaphane in the noon of life is an Egypt\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nplague which in the nights of prenativity and postmortemity is their\r\nmost proper ubi and quomodo. And as the ends and ultimates of all things\r\naccord in some mean and measure with their inceptions and originals,\r\nthat same multiplicit concordance which leads forth growth from birth\r\naccomplishing by a retrogressive metamorphosis that minishing and\r\nablation towards the final which is agreeable unto nature so is it with\r\nour subsolar being. The aged sisters draw us into life: we wail, batten,\r\nsport, clip, clasp, sunder, dwindle, die: over us dead they bend. First,\r\nsaved from waters of old Nile, among bulrushes, a bed of fasciated\r\nwattles: at last the cavity of a mountain, an occulted sepulchre amid\r\nthe conclamation of the hillcat and the ossifrage. And as no man knows\r\nthe ubicity of his tumulus nor to what processes we shall thereby be\r\nushered nor whether to Tophet or to Edenville in the like way is all\r\nhidden when we would backward see from what region of remoteness the\r\nwhatness of our whoness hath fetched his whenceness.\r\n\r\nThereto Punch Costello roared out mainly Etienne chanson but he loudly\r\nbid them, lo, wisdom hath built herself a house, this vast majestic\r\nlongstablished vault, the crystal palace of the Creator, all in applepie\r\norder, a penny for him who finds the pea.\r\n\r\n     Behold the mansion reared by dedal Jack\r\n     See the malt stored in many a refluent sack,\r\n     In the proud cirque of Jackjohn\xe2\x80\x99s bivouac.\r\n\r\nA black crack of noise in the street here, alack, bawled back. Loud on\r\nleft Thor thundered: in anger awful the hammerhurler. Came now the storm\r\nthat hist his heart. And Master Lynch bade him have a care to flout and\r\nwitwanton as the god self was angered for his hellprate and paganry. And\r\nhe that had erst challenged to be so doughty waxed wan as they might all\r\nmark and shrank together and his pitch that was before so haught uplift\r\nwas now of a sudden quite plucked down and his heart shook within the\r\ncage of his breast as he tasted the rumour of that storm. Then did some\r\nmock and some jeer and Punch Costello fell hard again to his yale which\r\nMaster Lenehan vowed he would do after and he was indeed but a word and\r\na blow on any the least colour. But the braggart boaster cried that an\r\nold Nobodaddy was in his cups it was muchwhat indifferent and he would\r\nnot lag behind his lead. But this was only to dye his desperation as\r\ncowed he crouched in Horne\xe2\x80\x99s hall. He drank indeed at one draught to\r\npluck up a heart of any grace for it thundered long rumblingly over all\r\nthe heavens so that Master Madden, being godly certain whiles, knocked\r\nhim on his ribs upon that crack of doom and Master Bloom, at the\r\nbraggart\xe2\x80\x99s side, spoke to him calming words to slumber his great fear,\r\nadvertising how it was no other thing but a hubbub noise that he heard,\r\nthe discharge of fluid from the thunderhead, look you, having taken\r\nplace, and all of the order of a natural phenomenon.\r\n\r\nBut was young Boasthard\xe2\x80\x99s fear vanquished by Calmer\xe2\x80\x99s words? No, for he\r\nhad in his bosom a spike named Bitterness which could not by words be\r\ndone away. And was he then neither calm like the one nor godly like the\r\nother? He was neither as much as he would have liked to be either. But\r\ncould he not have endeavoured to have found again as in his youth the\r\nbottle Holiness that then he lived withal? Indeed no for Grace was not\r\nthere to find that bottle. Heard he then in that clap the voice of the\r\ngod Bringforth or, what Calmer said, a hubbub of Phenomenon? Heard?\r\nWhy, he could not but hear unless he had plugged him up the tube\r\nUnderstanding (which he had not done). For through that tube he saw that\r\nhe was in the land of Phenomenon where he must for a certain one day die\r\nas he was like the rest too a passing show. And would he not accept to\r\ndie like the rest and pass away? By no means would he though he must nor\r\nwould he make more shows according as men do with wives which Phenomenon\r\nhas commanded them to do by the book Law. Then wotted he nought of that\r\nother land which is called Believe-on-Me, that is the land of promise\r\nwhich behoves to the king Delightful and shall be for ever where there\r\nis no death and no birth neither wiving nor mothering at which all shall\r\ncome as many as believe on it? Yes, Pious had told him of that land and\r\nChaste had pointed him to the way but the reason was that in the way he\r\nfell in with a certain whore of an eyepleasing exterior whose name, she\r\nsaid, is Bird-in-the-Hand and she beguiled him wrongways from the true\r\npath by her flatteries that she said to him as, Ho, you pretty man, turn\r\naside hither and I will show you a brave place, and she lay at him so\r\nflatteringly that she had him in her grot which is named Two-in-the-Bush\r\nor, by some learned, Carnal Concupiscence.\r\n\r\nThis was it what all that company that sat there at commons in Manse\r\nof Mothers the most lusted after and if they met with this whore\r\nBird-in-the-Hand (which was within all foul plagues, monsters and a\r\nwicked devil) they would strain the last but they would make at her and\r\nknow her. For regarding Believe-on-Me they said it was nought else\r\nbut notion and they could conceive no thought of it for, first,\r\nTwo-in-the-Bush whither she ticed them was the very goodliest grot and\r\nin it were four pillows on which were four tickets with these words\r\nprinted on them, Pickaback and Topsyturvy and Shameface and Cheek by\r\nJowl and, second, for that foul plague Allpox and the monsters they\r\ncared not for them for Preservative had given them a stout shield of\r\noxengut and, third, that they might take no hurt neither from Offspring\r\nthat was that wicked devil by virtue of this same shield which was\r\nnamed Killchild. So were they all in their blind fancy, Mr Cavil and Mr\r\nSometimes Godly, Mr Ape Swillale, Mr False Franklin, Mr Dainty Dixon,\r\nYoung Boasthard and Mr Cautious Calmer. Wherein, O wretched company,\r\nwere ye all deceived for that was the voice of the god that was in a\r\nvery grievous rage that he would presently lift his arm up and\r\nspill their souls for their abuses and their spillings done by them\r\ncontrariwise to his word which forth to bring brenningly biddeth.\r\n\r\nSo Thursday sixteenth June Patk. Dignam laid in clay of an apoplexy and\r\nafter hard drought, please God, rained, a bargeman coming in by water a\r\nfifty mile or thereabout with turf saying the seed won\xe2\x80\x99t sprout, fields\r\nathirst, very sadcoloured and stunk mightily, the quags and tofts too.\r\nHard to breathe and all the young quicks clean consumed without sprinkle\r\nthis long while back as no man remembered to be without. The rosy buds\r\nall gone brown and spread out blobs and on the hills nought but dry flag\r\nand faggots that would catch at first fire. All the world saying, for\r\naught they knew, the big wind of last February a year that did havoc the\r\nland so pitifully a small thing beside this barrenness. But by and\r\nby, as said, this evening after sundown, the wind sitting in the\r\nwest, biggish swollen clouds to be seen as the night increased and the\r\nweatherwise poring up at them and some sheet lightnings at first and\r\nafter, past ten of the clock, one great stroke with a long thunder and\r\nin a brace of shakes all scamper pellmell within door for the smoking\r\nshower, the men making shelter for their straws with a clout or\r\nkerchief, womenfolk skipping off with kirtles catched up soon as the\r\npour came. In Ely place, Baggot street, Duke\xe2\x80\x99s lawn, thence through\r\nMerrion green up to Holles street a swash of water flowing that was\r\nbefore bonedry and not one chair or coach or fiacre seen about but\r\nno more crack after that first. Over against the Rt. Hon. Mr Justice\r\nFitzgibbon\xe2\x80\x99s door (that is to sit with Mr Healy the lawyer upon the\r\ncollege lands) Mal. Mulligan a gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s gentleman that had but come\r\nfrom Mr Moore\xe2\x80\x99s the writer\xe2\x80\x99s (that was a papish but is now, folk say,\r\na good Williamite) chanced against Alec. Bannon in a cut bob (which are\r\nnow in with dance cloaks of Kendal green) that was new got to town from\r\nMullingar with the stage where his coz and Mal M\xe2\x80\x99s brother will stay a\r\nmonth yet till Saint Swithin and asks what in the earth he does there,\r\nhe bound home and he to Andrew Horne\xe2\x80\x99s being stayed for to crush a cup\r\nof wine, so he said, but would tell him of a skittish heifer, big of\r\nher age and beef to the heel, and all this while poured with rain and\r\nso both together on to Horne\xe2\x80\x99s. There Leop. Bloom of Crawford\xe2\x80\x99s journal\r\nsitting snug with a covey of wags, likely brangling fellows, Dixon jun.,\r\nscholar of my lady of Mercy\xe2\x80\x99s, Vin. Lynch, a Scots fellow, Will. Madden,\r\nT. Lenehan, very sad about a racer he fancied and Stephen D. Leop. Bloom\r\nthere for a languor he had but was now better, he having dreamed tonight\r\na strange fancy of his dame Mrs Moll with red slippers on in a pair of\r\nTurkey trunks which is thought by those in ken to be for a change and\r\nMistress Purefoy there, that got in through pleading her belly, and now\r\non the stools, poor body, two days past her term, the midwives sore put\r\nto it and can\xe2\x80\x99t deliver, she queasy for a bowl of riceslop that is a\r\nshrewd drier up of the insides and her breath very heavy more than good\r\nand should be a bullyboy from the knocks, they say, but God give her\r\nsoon issue. \xe2\x80\x98Tis her ninth chick to live, I hear, and Lady day bit off\r\nher last chick\xe2\x80\x99s nails that was then a twelvemonth and with other three\r\nall breastfed that died written out in a fair hand in the king\xe2\x80\x99s bible.\r\nHer hub fifty odd and a methodist but takes the sacrament and is to\r\nbe seen any fair sabbath with a pair of his boys off Bullock harbour\r\ndapping on the sound with a heavybraked reel or in a punt he has\r\ntrailing for flounder and pollock and catches a fine bag, I hear. In sum\r\nan infinite great fall of rain and all refreshed and will much increase\r\nthe harvest yet those in ken say after wind and water fire shall come\r\nfor a prognostication of Malachi\xe2\x80\x99s almanac (and I hear that Mr Russell\r\nhas done a prophetical charm of the same gist out of the Hindustanish\r\nfor his farmer\xe2\x80\x99s gazette) to have three things in all but this a mere\r\nfetch without bottom of reason for old crones and bairns yet sometimes\r\nthey are found in the right guess with their queerities no telling how.\r\n\r\nWith this came up Lenehan to the feet of the table to say how the letter\r\nwas in that night\xe2\x80\x99s gazette and he made a show to find it about him\r\n(for he swore with an oath that he had been at pains about it) but on\r\nStephen\xe2\x80\x99s persuasion he gave over the search and was bidden to sit near\r\nby which he did mighty brisk. He was a kind of sport gentleman that\r\nwent for a merryandrew or honest pickle and what belonged of women,\r\nhorseflesh or hot scandal he had it pat. To tell the truth he was mean\r\nin fortunes and for the most part hankered about the coffeehouses\r\nand low taverns with crimps, ostlers, bookies, Paul\xe2\x80\x99s men, runners,\r\nflatcaps, waistcoateers, ladies of the bagnio and other rogues of the\r\ngame or with a chanceable catchpole or a tipstaff often at nights\r\ntill broad day of whom he picked up between his sackpossets much loose\r\ngossip. He took his ordinary at a boilingcook\xe2\x80\x99s and if he had but gotten\r\ninto him a mess of broken victuals or a platter of tripes with a bare\r\ntester in his purse he could always bring himself off with his tongue,\r\nsome randy quip he had from a punk or whatnot that every mother\xe2\x80\x99s son of\r\nthem would burst their sides. The other, Costello that is, hearing this\r\ntalk asked was it poetry or a tale. Faith, no, he says, Frank (that was\r\nhis name), \xe2\x80\x98tis all about Kerry cows that are to be butchered along of\r\nthe plague. But they can go hang, says he with a wink, for me with their\r\nbully beef, a pox on it. There\xe2\x80\x99s as good fish in this tin as ever came\r\nout of it and very friendly he offered to take of some salty sprats that\r\nstood by which he had eyed wishly in the meantime and found the place\r\nwhich was indeed the chief design of his embassy as he was sharpset.\r\nMort aux vaches, says Frank then in the French language that had been\r\nindentured to a brandyshipper that has a winelodge in Bordeaux and he\r\nspoke French like a gentleman too. From a child this Frank had been\r\na donought that his father, a headborough, who could ill keep him to\r\nschool to learn his letters and the use of the globes, matriculated at\r\nthe university to study the mechanics but he took the bit between his\r\nteeth like a raw colt and was more familiar with the justiciary and the\r\nparish beadle than with his volumes. One time he would be a playactor,\r\nthen a sutler or a welsher, then nought would keep him from the bearpit\r\nand the cocking main, then he was for the ocean sea or to hoof it on\r\nthe roads with the romany folk, kidnapping a squire\xe2\x80\x99s heir by favour of\r\nmoonlight or fecking maids\xe2\x80\x99 linen or choking chicken behind a hedge. He\r\nhad been off as many times as a cat has lives and back again with naked\r\npockets as many more to his father the headborough who shed a pint\r\nof tears as often as he saw him. What, says Mr Leopold with his hands\r\nacross, that was earnest to know the drift of it, will they slaughter\r\nall? I protest I saw them but this day morning going to the Liverpool\r\nboats, says he. I can scarce believe \xe2\x80\x98tis so bad, says he. And he had\r\nexperience of the like brood beasts and of springers, greasy hoggets and\r\nwether wool, having been some years before actuary for Mr Joseph Cuffe,\r\na worthy salesmaster that drove his trade for live stock and meadow\r\nauctions hard by Mr Gavin Low\xe2\x80\x99s yard in Prussia street. I question with\r\nyou there, says he. More like \xe2\x80\x98tis the hoose or the timber tongue. Mr\r\nStephen, a little moved but very handsomely told him no such matter and\r\nthat he had dispatches from the emperor\xe2\x80\x99s chief tailtickler thanking\r\nhim for the hospitality, that was sending over Doctor Rinderpest, the\r\nbestquoted cowcatcher in all Muscovy, with a bolus or two of physic to\r\ntake the bull by the horns. Come, come, says Mr Vincent, plain dealing.\r\nHe\xe2\x80\x99ll find himself on the horns of a dilemma if he meddles with a\r\nbull that\xe2\x80\x99s Irish, says he. Irish by name and irish by nature, says Mr\r\nStephen, and he sent the ale purling about, an Irish bull in an English\r\nchinashop. I conceive you, says Mr Dixon. It is that same bull that was\r\nsent to our island by farmer Nicholas, the bravest cattlebreeder of them\r\nall, with an emerald ring in his nose. True for you, says Mr Vincent\r\ncross the table, and a bullseye into the bargain, says he, and a plumper\r\nand a portlier bull, says he, never shit on shamrock. He had horns\r\ngalore, a coat of cloth of gold and a sweet smoky breath coming out of\r\nhis nostrils so that the women of our island, leaving doughballs and\r\nrollingpins, followed after him hanging his bulliness in daisychains.\r\nWhat for that, says Mr Dixon, but before he came over farmer Nicholas\r\nthat was a eunuch had him properly gelded by a college of doctors who\r\nwere no better off than himself. So be off now, says he, and do all my\r\ncousin german the lord Harry tells you and take a farmer\xe2\x80\x99s blessing, and\r\nwith that he slapped his posteriors very soundly. But the slap and the\r\nblessing stood him friend, says Mr Vincent, for to make up he taught him\r\na trick worth two of the other so that maid, wife, abbess and widow to\r\nthis day affirm that they would rather any time of the month whisper\r\nin his ear in the dark of a cowhouse or get a lick on the nape from his\r\nlong holy tongue than lie with the finest strapping young ravisher in\r\nthe four fields of all Ireland. Another then put in his word: And they\r\ndressed him, says he, in a point shift and petticoat with a tippet and\r\ngirdle and ruffles on his wrists and clipped his forelock and rubbed him\r\nall over with spermacetic oil and built stables for him at every turn of\r\nthe road with a gold manger in each full of the best hay in the market\r\nso that he could doss and dung to his heart\xe2\x80\x99s content. By this time the\r\nfather of the faithful (for so they called him) was grown so heavy that\r\nhe could scarce walk to pasture. To remedy which our cozening dames and\r\ndamsels brought him his fodder in their apronlaps and as soon as his\r\nbelly was full he would rear up on his hind quarters to show their\r\nladyships a mystery and roar and bellow out of him in bulls\xe2\x80\x99 language\r\nand they all after him. Ay, says another, and so pampered was he that he\r\nwould suffer nought to grow in all the land but green grass for himself\r\n(for that was the only colour to his mind) and there was a board put up\r\non a hillock in the middle of the island with a printed notice, saying:\r\nBy the Lord Harry, Green is the grass that grows on the ground. And,\r\nsays Mr Dixon, if ever he got scent of a cattleraider in Roscommon or\r\nthe wilds of Connemara or a husbandman in Sligo that was sowing as much\r\nas a handful of mustard or a bag of rapeseed out he\xe2\x80\x99d run amok over half\r\nthe countryside rooting up with his horns whatever was planted and all\r\nby lord Harry\xe2\x80\x99s orders. There was bad blood between them at first, says\r\nMr Vincent, and the lord Harry called farmer Nicholas all the old Nicks\r\nin the world and an old whoremaster that kept seven trulls in his house\r\nand I\xe2\x80\x99ll meddle in his matters, says he. I\xe2\x80\x99ll make that animal smell\r\nhell, says he, with the help of that good pizzle my father left me. But\r\none evening, says Mr Dixon, when the lord Harry was cleaning his royal\r\npelt to go to dinner after winning a boatrace (he had spade oars for\r\nhimself but the first rule of the course was that the others were to row\r\nwith pitchforks) he discovered in himself a wonderful likeness to a bull\r\nand on picking up a blackthumbed chapbook that he kept in the pantry\r\nhe found sure enough that he was a lefthanded descendant of the famous\r\nchampion bull of the Romans, Bos Bovum, which is good bog Latin for boss\r\nof the show. After that, says Mr Vincent, the lord Harry put his head\r\ninto a cow\xe2\x80\x99s drinkingtrough in the presence of all his courtiers and\r\npulling it out again told them all his new name. Then, with the water\r\nrunning off him, he got into an old smock and skirt that had belonged to\r\nhis grandmother and bought a grammar of the bulls\xe2\x80\x99 language to study\r\nbut he could never learn a word of it except the first personal pronoun\r\nwhich he copied out big and got off by heart and if ever he went out for\r\na walk he filled his pockets with chalk to write it upon what took his\r\nfancy, the side of a rock or a teahouse table or a bale of cotton or\r\na corkfloat. In short, he and the bull of Ireland were soon as fast\r\nfriends as an arse and a shirt. They were, says Mr Stephen, and the end\r\nwas that the men of the island seeing no help was toward, as the ungrate\r\nwomen were all of one mind, made a wherry raft, loaded themselves and\r\ntheir bundles of chattels on shipboard, set all masts erect, manned the\r\nyards, sprang their luff, heaved to, spread three sheets in the wind,\r\nput her head between wind and water, weighed anchor, ported her helm,\r\nran up the jolly Roger, gave three times three, let the bullgine run,\r\npushed off in their bumboat and put to sea to recover the main of\r\nAmerica. Which was the occasion, says Mr Vincent, of the composing by a\r\nboatswain of that rollicking chanty:\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x94Pope Peter\xe2\x80\x99s but a pissabed.\r\n     A man\xe2\x80\x99s a man for a\xe2\x80\x99 that.\r\n\r\nOur worthy acquaintance Mr Malachi Mulligan now appeared in the doorway\r\nas the students were finishing their apologue accompanied with a friend\r\nwhom he had just rencountered, a young gentleman, his name Alec Bannon,\r\nwho had late come to town, it being his intention to buy a colour or a\r\ncornetcy in the fencibles and list for the wars. Mr Mulligan was civil\r\nenough to express some relish of it all the more as it jumped with a\r\nproject of his own for the cure of the very evil that had been touched\r\non. Whereat he handed round to the company a set of pasteboard cards\r\nwhich he had had printed that day at Mr Quinnell\xe2\x80\x99s bearing a legend\r\nprinted in fair italics: Mr Malachi Mulligan. Fertiliser and Incubator.\r\nLambay Island. His project, as he went on to expound, was to withdraw\r\nfrom the round of idle pleasures such as form the chief business of sir\r\nFopling Popinjay and sir Milksop Quidnunc in town and to devote himself\r\nto the noblest task for which our bodily organism has been framed. Well,\r\nlet us hear of it, good my friend, said Mr Dixon. I make no doubt it\r\nsmacks of wenching. Come, be seated, both. \xe2\x80\x98Tis as cheap sitting as\r\nstanding. Mr Mulligan accepted of the invitation and, expatiating upon\r\nhis design, told his hearers that he had been led into this thought by\r\na consideration of the causes of sterility, both the inhibitory and the\r\nprohibitory, whether the inhibition in its turn were due to conjugal\r\nvexations or to a parsimony of the balance as well as whether the\r\nprohibition proceeded from defects congenital or from proclivities\r\nacquired. It grieved him plaguily, he said, to see the nuptial couch\r\ndefrauded of its dearest pledges: and to reflect upon so many agreeable\r\nfemales with rich jointures, a prey to the vilest bonzes, who hide their\r\nflambeau under a bushel in an uncongenial cloister or lose their womanly\r\nbloom in the embraces of some unaccountable muskin when they might\r\nmultiply the inlets of happiness, sacrificing the inestimable jewel of\r\ntheir sex when a hundred pretty fellows were at hand to caress, this, he\r\nassured them, made his heart weep. To curb this inconvenient (which\r\nhe concluded due to a suppression of latent heat), having advised with\r\ncertain counsellors of worth and inspected into this matter, he had\r\nresolved to purchase in fee simple for ever the freehold of Lambay\r\nisland from its holder, lord Talbot de Malahide, a Tory gentleman of\r\nnote much in favour with our ascendancy party. He proposed to set up\r\nthere a national fertilising farm to be named Omphalos with an obelisk\r\nhewn and erected after the fashion of Egypt and to offer his dutiful\r\nyeoman services for the fecundation of any female of what grade of life\r\nsoever who should there direct to him with the desire of fulfilling the\r\nfunctions of her natural. Money was no object, he said, nor would he\r\ntake a penny for his pains. The poorest kitchenwench no less than the\r\nopulent lady of fashion, if so be their constructions and their tempers\r\nwere warm persuaders for their petitions, would find in him their man.\r\nFor his nutriment he shewed how he would feed himself exclusively upon a\r\ndiet of savoury tubercles and fish and coneys there, the flesh of these\r\nlatter prolific rodents being highly recommended for his purpose, both\r\nbroiled and stewed with a blade of mace and a pod or two of capsicum\r\nchillies. After this homily which he delivered with much warmth of\r\nasseveration Mr Mulligan in a trice put off from his hat a kerchief with\r\nwhich he had shielded it. They both, it seems, had been overtaken by the\r\nrain and for all their mending their pace had taken water, as might be\r\nobserved by Mr Mulligan\xe2\x80\x99s smallclothes of a hodden grey which was now\r\nsomewhat piebald. His project meanwhile was very favourably entertained\r\nby his auditors and won hearty eulogies from all though Mr Dixon of\r\nMary\xe2\x80\x99s excepted to it, asking with a finicking air did he purpose also\r\nto carry coals to Newcastle. Mr Mulligan however made court to the\r\nscholarly by an apt quotation from the classics which, as it dwelt\r\nupon his memory, seemed to him a sound and tasteful support of his\r\ncontention: Talis ac tanta depravatio hujus seculi, O quirites,\r\nut matresfamiliarum nostrae lascivas cujuslibet semiviri libici\r\ntitillationes testibus ponderosis atque excelsis erectionibus\r\ncenturionum Romanorum magnopere anteponunt, while for those of ruder wit\r\nhe drove home his point by analogies of the animal kingdom more suitable\r\nto their stomach, the buck and doe of the forest glade, the farmyard\r\ndrake and duck.\r\n\r\nValuing himself not a little upon his elegance, being indeed a proper\r\nman of person, this talkative now applied himself to his dress with\r\nanimadversions of some heat upon the sudden whimsy of the atmospherics\r\nwhile the company lavished their encomiums upon the project he had\r\nadvanced. The young gentleman, his friend, overjoyed as he was at a\r\npassage that had late befallen him, could not forbear to tell it his\r\nnearest neighbour. Mr Mulligan, now perceiving the table, asked for whom\r\nwere those loaves and fishes and, seeing the stranger, he made him\r\na civil bow and said, Pray, sir, was you in need of any professional\r\nassistance we could give? Who, upon his offer, thanked him very\r\nheartily, though preserving his proper distance, and replied that he was\r\ncome there about a lady, now an inmate of Horne\xe2\x80\x99s house, that was in an\r\ninteresting condition, poor body, from woman\xe2\x80\x99s woe (and here he fetched\r\na deep sigh) to know if her happiness had yet taken place. Mr Dixon,\r\nto turn the table, took on to ask of Mr Mulligan himself whether\r\nhis incipient ventripotence, upon which he rallied him, betokened an\r\novoblastic gestation in the prostatic utricle or male womb or was due,\r\nas with the noted physician, Mr Austin Meldon, to a wolf in the stomach.\r\nFor answer Mr Mulligan, in a gale of laughter at his smalls, smote\r\nhimself bravely below the diaphragm, exclaiming with an admirable droll\r\nmimic of Mother Grogan (the most excellent creature of her sex though\r\n\xe2\x80\x98tis pity she\xe2\x80\x99s a trollop): There\xe2\x80\x99s a belly that never bore a bastard.\r\nThis was so happy a conceit that it renewed the storm of mirth and threw\r\nthe whole room into the most violent agitations of delight. The spry\r\nrattle had run on in the same vein of mimicry but for some larum in the\r\nantechamber.\r\n\r\nHere the listener who was none other than the Scotch student, a little\r\nfume of a fellow, blond as tow, congratulated in the liveliest fashion\r\nwith the young gentleman and, interrupting the narrative at a salient\r\npoint, having desired his visavis with a polite beck to have the\r\nobligingness to pass him a flagon of cordial waters at the same time by\r\na questioning poise of the head (a whole century of polite breeding had\r\nnot achieved so nice a gesture) to which was united an equivalent but\r\ncontrary balance of the bottle asked the narrator as plainly as was ever\r\ndone in words if he might treat him with a cup of it. Mais bien s\xc3\xbbr,\r\nnoble stranger, said he cheerily, et mille compliments. That you may\r\nand very opportunely. There wanted nothing but this cup to crown my\r\nfelicity. But, gracious heaven, was I left with but a crust in my wallet\r\nand a cupful of water from the well, my God, I would accept of them and\r\nfind it in my heart to kneel down upon the ground and give thanks to\r\nthe powers above for the happiness vouchsafed me by the Giver of good\r\nthings. With these words he approached the goblet to his lips, took a\r\ncomplacent draught of the cordial, slicked his hair and, opening his\r\nbosom, out popped a locket that hung from a silk riband, that very\r\npicture which he had cherished ever since her hand had wrote therein.\r\nGazing upon those features with a world of tenderness, Ah, Monsieur, he\r\nsaid, had you but beheld her as I did with these eyes at that affecting\r\ninstant with her dainty tucker and her new coquette cap (a gift for her\r\nfeastday as she told me prettily) in such an artless disorder, of so\r\nmelting a tenderness, \xe2\x80\x98pon my conscience, even you, Monsieur, had been\r\nimpelled by generous nature to deliver yourself wholly into the hands of\r\nsuch an enemy or to quit the field for ever. I declare, I was never so\r\ntouched in all my life. God, I thank thee, as the Author of my days!\r\nThrice happy will he be whom so amiable a creature will bless with her\r\nfavours. A sigh of affection gave eloquence to these words and, having\r\nreplaced the locket in his bosom, he wiped his eye and sighed again.\r\nBeneficent Disseminator of blessings to all Thy creatures, how great\r\nand universal must be that sweetest of Thy tyrannies which can hold in\r\nthrall the free and the bond, the simple swain and the polished coxcomb,\r\nthe lover in the heyday of reckless passion and the husband of maturer\r\nyears. But indeed, sir, I wander from the point. How mingled and\r\nimperfect are all our sublunary joys. Maledicity! he exclaimed in\r\nanguish. Would to God that foresight had but remembered me to take my\r\ncloak along! I could weep to think of it. Then, though it had poured\r\nseven showers, we were neither of us a penny the worse. But beshrew me,\r\nhe cried, clapping hand to his forehead, tomorrow will be a new day and,\r\nthousand thunders, I know of a marchand de capotes, Monsieur Poyntz,\r\nfrom whom I can have for a livre as snug a cloak of the French fashion\r\nas ever kept a lady from wetting. Tut, tut! cries Le F\xc3\xa9condateur,\r\ntripping in, my friend Monsieur Moore, that most accomplished traveller\r\n(I have just cracked a half bottle avec lui in a circle of the best wits\r\nof the town), is my authority that in Cape Horn, ventre biche, they have\r\na rain that will wet through any, even the stoutest cloak. A drenching\r\nof that violence, he tells me, sans blague, has sent more than one\r\nluckless fellow in good earnest posthaste to another world. Pooh! A\r\nlivre! cries Monsieur Lynch. The clumsy things are dear at a sou. One\r\numbrella, were it no bigger than a fairy mushroom, is worth ten such\r\nstopgaps. No woman of any wit would wear one. My dear Kitty told me\r\ntoday that she would dance in a deluge before ever she would starve in\r\nsuch an ark of salvation for, as she reminded me (blushing piquantly and\r\nwhispering in my ear though there was none to snap her words but giddy\r\nbutterflies), dame Nature, by the divine blessing, has implanted it in\r\nour hearts and it has become a household word that il y a deux choses\r\nfor which the innocence of our original garb, in other circumstances a\r\nbreach of the proprieties, is the fittest, nay, the only garment. The\r\nfirst, said she (and here my pretty philosopher, as I handed her to her\r\ntilbury, to fix my attention, gently tipped with her tongue the outer\r\nchamber of my ear), the first is a bath... But at this point a bell\r\ntinkling in the hall cut short a discourse which promised so bravely for\r\nthe enrichment of our store of knowledge.\r\n\r\nAmid the general vacant hilarity of the assembly a bell rang and, while\r\nall were conjecturing what might be the cause, Miss Callan entered and,\r\nhaving spoken a few words in a low tone to young Mr Dixon, retired with\r\na profound bow to the company. The presence even for a moment among a\r\nparty of debauchees of a woman endued with every quality of modesty and\r\nnot less severe than beautiful refrained the humourous sallies even of\r\nthe most licentious but her departure was the signal for an outbreak of\r\nribaldry. Strike me silly, said Costello, a low fellow who was fuddled.\r\nA monstrous fine bit of cowflesh! I\xe2\x80\x99ll be sworn she has rendezvoused\r\nyou. What, you dog? Have you a way with them? Gad\xe2\x80\x99s bud, immensely\r\nso, said Mr Lynch. The bedside manner it is that they use in the Mater\r\nhospice. Demme, does not Doctor O\xe2\x80\x99Gargle chuck the nuns there under the\r\nchin. As I look to be saved I had it from my Kitty who has been wardmaid\r\nthere any time these seven months. Lawksamercy, doctor, cried the young\r\nblood in the primrose vest, feigning a womanish simper and with immodest\r\nsquirmings of his body, how you do tease a body! Drat the man! Bless\r\nme, I\xe2\x80\x99m all of a wibbly wobbly. Why, you\xe2\x80\x99re as bad as dear little Father\r\nCantekissem, that you are! May this pot of four half choke me, cried\r\nCostello, if she aint in the family way. I knows a lady what\xe2\x80\x99s got a\r\nwhite swelling quick as I claps eyes on her. The young surgeon, however,\r\nrose and begged the company to excuse his retreat as the nurse had just\r\nthen informed him that he was needed in the ward. Merciful providence\r\nhad been pleased to put a period to the sufferings of the lady who was\r\nenceinte which she had borne with a laudable fortitude and she had\r\ngiven birth to a bouncing boy. I want patience, said he, with those\r\nwho, without wit to enliven or learning to instruct, revile an ennobling\r\nprofession which, saving the reverence due to the Deity, is the greatest\r\npower for happiness upon the earth. I am positive when I say that if\r\nneed were I could produce a cloud of witnesses to the excellence of\r\nher noble exercitations which, so far from being a byword, should be a\r\nglorious incentive in the human breast. I cannot away with them. What?\r\nMalign such an one, the amiable Miss Callan, who is the lustre of\r\nher own sex and the astonishment of ours? And at an instant the most\r\nmomentous that can befall a puny child of clay? Perish the thought! I\r\nshudder to think of the future of a race where the seeds of such malice\r\nhave been sown and where no right reverence is rendered to mother and\r\nmaid in house of Horne. Having delivered himself of this rebuke he\r\nsaluted those present on the by and repaired to the door. A murmur\r\nof approval arose from all and some were for ejecting the low soaker\r\nwithout more ado, a design which would have been effected nor would\r\nhe have received more than his bare deserts had he not abridged his\r\ntransgression by affirming with a horrid imprecation (for he swore a\r\nround hand) that he was as good a son of the true fold as ever drew\r\nbreath. Stap my vitals, said he, them was always the sentiments of\r\nhonest Frank Costello which I was bred up most particular to honour thy\r\nfather and thy mother that had the best hand to a rolypoly or a hasty\r\npudding as you ever see what I always looks back on with a loving heart.\r\n\r\nTo revert to Mr Bloom who, after his first entry, had been conscious of\r\nsome impudent mocks which he however had borne with as being the fruits\r\nof that age upon which it is commonly charged that it knows not\r\npity. The young sparks, it is true, were as full of extravagancies\r\nas overgrown children: the words of their tumultuary discussions\r\nwere difficultly understood and not often nice: their testiness and\r\noutrageous mots were such that his intellects resiled from: nor were\r\nthey scrupulously sensible of the proprieties though their fund of\r\nstrong animal spirits spoke in their behalf. But the word of Mr Costello\r\nwas an unwelcome language for him for he nauseated the wretch that\r\nseemed to him a cropeared creature of a misshapen gibbosity, born out\r\nof wedlock and thrust like a crookback toothed and feet first into the\r\nworld, which the dint of the surgeon\xe2\x80\x99s pliers in his skull lent indeed\r\na colour to, so as to put him in thought of that missing link of\r\ncreation\xe2\x80\x99s chain desiderated by the late ingenious Mr Darwin. It was now\r\nfor more than the middle span of our allotted years that he had passed\r\nthrough the thousand vicissitudes of existence and, being of a wary\r\nascendancy and self a man of rare forecast, he had enjoined his heart\r\nto repress all motions of a rising choler and, by intercepting them\r\nwith the readiest precaution, foster within his breast that plenitude\r\nof sufferance which base minds jeer at, rash judgers scorn and all find\r\ntolerable and but tolerable. To those who create themselves wits at the\r\ncost of feminine delicacy (a habit of mind which he never did hold\r\nwith) to them he would concede neither to bear the name nor to herit\r\nthe tradition of a proper breeding: while for such that, having lost\r\nall forbearance, can lose no more, there remained the sharp antidote of\r\nexperience to cause their insolency to beat a precipitate and inglorious\r\nretreat. Not but what he could feel with mettlesome youth which, caring\r\nnought for the mows of dotards or the gruntlings of the severe, is ever\r\n(as the chaste fancy of the Holy Writer expresses it) for eating of the\r\ntree forbid it yet not so far forth as to pretermit humanity upon any\r\ncondition soever towards a gentlewoman when she was about her lawful\r\noccasions. To conclude, while from the sister\xe2\x80\x99s words he had reckoned\r\nupon a speedy delivery he was, however, it must be owned, not a little\r\nalleviated by the intelligence that the issue so auspicated after an\r\nordeal of such duress now testified once more to the mercy as well as to\r\nthe bounty of the Supreme Being.\r\n\r\nAccordingly he broke his mind to his neighbour, saying that, to express\r\nhis notion of the thing, his opinion (who ought not perchance to express\r\none) was that one must have a cold constitution and a frigid genius not\r\nto be rejoiced by this freshest news of the fruition of her confinement\r\nsince she had been in such pain through no fault of hers. The dressy\r\nyoung blade said it was her husband\xe2\x80\x99s that put her in that expectation\r\nor at least it ought to be unless she were another Ephesian matron. I\r\nmust acquaint you, said Mr Crotthers, clapping on the table so as to\r\nevoke a resonant comment of emphasis, old Glory Allelujurum was round\r\nagain today, an elderly man with dundrearies, preferring through his\r\nnose a request to have word of Wilhelmina, my life, as he calls her. I\r\nbade him hold himself in readiness for that the event would burst anon.\r\n\xe2\x80\x98Slife, I\xe2\x80\x99ll be round with you. I cannot but extol the virile potency of\r\nthe old bucko that could still knock another child out of her. All fell\r\nto praising of it, each after his own fashion, though the same young\r\nblade held with his former view that another than her conjugial had\r\nbeen the man in the gap, a clerk in orders, a linkboy (virtuous) or\r\nan itinerant vendor of articles needed in every household. Singular,\r\ncommuned the guest with himself, the wonderfully unequal faculty of\r\nmetempsychosis possessed by them, that the puerperal dormitory and the\r\ndissecting theatre should be the seminaries of such frivolity, that the\r\nmere acquisition of academic titles should suffice to transform in a\r\npinch of time these votaries of levity into exemplary practitioners of\r\nan art which most men anywise eminent have esteemed the noblest. But,\r\nhe further added, it is mayhap to relieve the pentup feelings that in\r\ncommon oppress them for I have more than once observed that birds of a\r\nfeather laugh together.\r\n\r\nBut with what fitness, let it be asked of the noble lord, his patron,\r\nhas this alien, whom the concession of a gracious prince has admitted\r\nto civic rights, constituted himself the lord paramount of our\r\ninternal polity? Where is now that gratitude which loyalty should have\r\ncounselled? During the recent war whenever the enemy had a temporary\r\nadvantage with his granados did this traitor to his kind not seize that\r\nmoment to discharge his piece against the empire of which he is a tenant\r\nat will while he trembled for the security of his four per cents? Has he\r\nforgotten this as he forgets all benefits received? Or is it that from\r\nbeing a deluder of others he has become at last his own dupe as he is,\r\nif report belie him not, his own and his only enjoyer? Far be it from\r\ncandour to violate the bedchamber of a respectable lady, the daughter of\r\na gallant major, or to cast the most distant reflections upon her\r\nvirtue but if he challenges attention there (as it was indeed highly his\r\ninterest not to have done) then be it so. Unhappy woman, she has been\r\ntoo long and too persistently denied her legitimate prerogative to\r\nlisten to his objurgations with any other feeling than the derision of\r\nthe desperate. He says this, a censor of morals, a very pelican in his\r\npiety, who did not scruple, oblivious of the ties of nature, to attempt\r\nillicit intercourse with a female domestic drawn from the lowest strata\r\nof society! Nay, had the hussy\xe2\x80\x99s scouringbrush not been her tutelary\r\nangel, it had gone with her as hard as with Hagar, the Egyptian! In the\r\nquestion of the grazing lands his peevish asperity is notorious and in\r\nMr Cuffe\xe2\x80\x99s hearing brought upon him from an indignant rancher a scathing\r\nretort couched in terms as straightforward as they were bucolic. It ill\r\nbecomes him to preach that gospel. Has he not nearer home a seedfield\r\nthat lies fallow for the want of the ploughshare? A habit reprehensible\r\nat puberty is second nature and an opprobrium in middle life. If he must\r\ndispense his balm of Gilead in nostrums and apothegms of dubious taste\r\nto restore to health a generation of unfledged profligates let his\r\npractice consist better with the doctrines that now engross him. His\r\nmarital breast is the repository of secrets which decorum is reluctant\r\nto adduce. The lewd suggestions of some faded beauty may console him for\r\na consort neglected and debauched but this new exponent of morals and\r\nhealer of ills is at his best an exotic tree which, when rooted in\r\nits native orient, throve and flourished and was abundant in balm\r\nbut, transplanted to a clime more temperate, its roots have lost their\r\nquondam vigour while the stuff that comes away from it is stagnant, acid\r\nand inoperative.\r\n\r\nThe news was imparted with a circumspection recalling the ceremonial\r\nusage of the Sublime Porte by the second female infirmarian to the\r\njunior medical officer in residence, who in his turn announced to the\r\ndelegation that an heir had been born. When he had betaken himself\r\nto the women\xe2\x80\x99s apartment to assist at the prescribed ceremony of the\r\nafterbirth in the presence of the secretary of state for domestic\r\naffairs and the members of the privy council, silent in unanimous\r\nexhaustion and approbation the delegates, chafing under the length and\r\nsolemnity of their vigil and hoping that the joyful occurrence would\r\npalliate a licence which the simultaneous absence of abigail and\r\nobstetrician rendered the easier, broke out at once into a strife of\r\ntongues. In vain the voice of Mr Canvasser Bloom was heard endeavouring\r\nto urge, to mollify, to refrain. The moment was too propitious for the\r\ndisplay of that discursiveness which seemed the only bond of union among\r\ntempers so divergent. Every phase of the situation was successively\r\neviscerated: the prenatal repugnance of uterine brothers, the Caesarean\r\nsection, posthumity with respect to the father and, that rarer form,\r\nwith respect to the mother, the fratricidal case known as the Childs\r\nMurder and rendered memorable by the impassioned plea of Mr Advocate\r\nBushe which secured the acquittal of the wrongfully accused, the\r\nrights of primogeniture and king\xe2\x80\x99s bounty touching twins and triplets,\r\nmiscarriages and infanticides, simulated or dissimulated, the acardiac\r\nfoetus in foetu and aprosopia due to a congestion, the agnathia\r\nof certain chinless Chinamen (cited by Mr Candidate Mulligan) in\r\nconsequence of defective reunion of the maxillary knobs along the medial\r\nline so that (as he said) one ear could hear what the other spoke, the\r\nbenefits of anesthesia or twilight sleep, the prolongation of labour\r\npains in advanced gravidancy by reason of pressure on the vein, the\r\npremature relentment of the amniotic fluid (as exemplified in the\r\nactual case) with consequent peril of sepsis to the matrix, artificial\r\ninsemination by means of syringes, involution of the womb consequent\r\nupon the menopause, the problem of the perpetration of the species in\r\nthe case of females impregnated by delinquent rape, that distressing\r\nmanner of delivery called by the Brandenburghers Sturzgeburt, the\r\nrecorded instances of multiseminal, twikindled and monstrous births\r\nconceived during the catamenic period or of consanguineous parents\xe2\x80\x94in a\r\nword all the cases of human nativity which Aristotle has classified\r\nin his masterpiece with chromolithographic illustrations. The gravest\r\nproblems of obstetrics and forensic medicine were examined with as much\r\nanimation as the most popular beliefs on the state of pregnancy such as\r\nthe forbidding to a gravid woman to step over a countrystile lest,\r\nby her movement, the navelcord should strangle her creature and\r\nthe injunction upon her in the event of a yearning, ardently and\r\nineffectually entertained, to place her hand against that part of her\r\nperson which long usage has consecrated as the seat of castigation.\r\nThe abnormalities of harelip, breastmole, supernumerary digits, negro\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ninkle, strawberry mark and portwine stain were alleged by one as a prima\r\nfacie and natural hypothetical explanation of those swineheaded (the\r\ncase of Madame Grissel Steevens was not forgotten) or doghaired infants\r\noccasionally born. The hypothesis of a plasmic memory, advanced by the\r\nCaledonian envoy and worthy of the metaphysical traditions of the land\r\nhe stood for, envisaged in such cases an arrest of embryonic development\r\nat some stage antecedent to the human. An outlandish delegate sustained\r\nagainst both these views, with such heat as almost carried conviction,\r\nthe theory of copulation between women and the males of brutes, his\r\nauthority being his own avouchment in support of fables such as that of\r\nthe Minotaur which the genius of the elegant Latin poet has handed down\r\nto us in the pages of his Metamorphoses. The impression made by his\r\nwords was immediate but shortlived. It was effaced as easily as it had\r\nbeen evoked by an allocution from Mr Candidate Mulligan in that vein of\r\npleasantry which none better than he knew how to affect, postulating as\r\nthe supremest object of desire a nice clean old man. Contemporaneously,\r\na heated argument having arisen between Mr Delegate Madden and Mr\r\nCandidate Lynch regarding the juridical and theological dilemma created\r\nin the event of one Siamese twin predeceasing the other, the difficulty\r\nby mutual consent was referred to Mr Canvasser Bloom for instant\r\nsubmittal to Mr Coadjutor Deacon Dedalus. Hitherto silent, whether the\r\nbetter to show by preternatural gravity that curious dignity of the\r\ngarb with which he was invested or in obedience to an inward voice, he\r\ndelivered briefly and, as some thought, perfunctorily the ecclesiastical\r\nordinance forbidding man to put asunder what God has joined.\r\n\r\nBut Malachias\xe2\x80\x99 tale began to freeze them with horror. He conjured up the\r\nscene before them. The secret panel beside the chimney slid back and in\r\nthe recess appeared... Haines! Which of us did not feel his flesh creep!\r\nHe had a portfolio full of Celtic literature in one hand, in the other\r\na phial marked Poison. Surprise, horror, loathing were depicted on all\r\nfaces while he eyed them with a ghostly grin. I anticipated some such\r\nreception, he began with an eldritch laugh, for which, it seems, history\r\nis to blame. Yes, it is true. I am the murderer of Samuel Childs.\r\nAnd how I am punished! The inferno has no terrors for me. This is the\r\nappearance is on me. Tare and ages, what way would I be resting at all,\r\nhe muttered thickly, and I tramping Dublin this while back with my share\r\nof songs and himself after me the like of a soulth or a bullawurrus? My\r\nhell, and Ireland\xe2\x80\x99s, is in this life. It is what I tried to obliterate\r\nmy crime. Distractions, rookshooting, the Erse language (he recited\r\nsome), laudanum (he raised the phial to his lips), camping out. In vain!\r\nHis spectre stalks me. Dope is my only hope... Ah! Destruction! The\r\nblack panther! With a cry he suddenly vanished and the panel slid back.\r\nAn instant later his head appeared in the door opposite and said: Meet\r\nme at Westland Row station at ten past eleven. He was gone. Tears\r\ngushed from the eyes of the dissipated host. The seer raised his hand\r\nto heaven, murmuring: The vendetta of Mananaun! The sage repeated: Lex\r\ntalionis. The sentimentalist is he who would enjoy without incurring\r\nthe immense debtorship for a thing done. Malachias, overcome by emotion,\r\nceased. The mystery was unveiled. Haines was the third brother. His\r\nreal name was Childs. The black panther was himself the ghost of his own\r\nfather. He drank drugs to obliterate. For this relief much thanks. The\r\nlonely house by the graveyard is uninhabited. No soul will live there.\r\nThe spider pitches her web in the solitude. The nocturnal rat peers from\r\nhis hole. A curse is on it. It is haunted. Murderer\xe2\x80\x99s ground.\r\n\r\nWhat is the age of the soul of man? As she hath the virtue of the\r\nchameleon to change her hue at every new approach, to be gay with the\r\nmerry and mournful with the downcast, so too is her age changeable as\r\nher mood. No longer is Leopold, as he sits there, ruminating, chewing\r\nthe cud of reminiscence, that staid agent of publicity and holder of a\r\nmodest substance in the funds. A score of years are blown away. He is\r\nyoung Leopold. There, as in a retrospective arrangement, a mirror within\r\na mirror (hey, presto!), he beholdeth himself. That young figure of then\r\nis seen, precociously manly, walking on a nipping morning from the old\r\nhouse in Clanbrassil street to the high school, his booksatchel on\r\nhim bandolierwise, and in it a goodly hunk of wheaten loaf, a mother\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nthought. Or it is the same figure, a year or so gone over, in his first\r\nhard hat (ah, that was a day!), already on the road, a fullfledged\r\ntraveller for the family firm, equipped with an orderbook, a scented\r\nhandkerchief (not for show only), his case of bright trinketware (alas!\r\na thing now of the past!) and a quiverful of compliant smiles for this\r\nor that halfwon housewife reckoning it out upon her fingertips or for\r\na budding virgin, shyly acknowledging (but the heart? tell me!) his\r\nstudied baisemoins. The scent, the smile, but, more than these, the dark\r\neyes and oleaginous address, brought home at duskfall many a commission\r\nto the head of the firm, seated with Jacob\xe2\x80\x99s pipe after like labours in\r\nthe paternal ingle (a meal of noodles, you may be sure, is aheating),\r\nreading through round horned spectacles some paper from the Europe of a\r\nmonth before. But hey, presto, the mirror is breathed on and the young\r\nknighterrant recedes, shrivels, dwindles to a tiny speck within the\r\nmist. Now he is himself paternal and these about him might be his\r\nsons. Who can say? The wise father knows his own child. He thinks of a\r\ndrizzling night in Hatch street, hard by the bonded stores there, the\r\nfirst. Together (she is a poor waif, a child of shame, yours and mine\r\nand of all for a bare shilling and her luckpenny), together they hear\r\nthe heavy tread of the watch as two raincaped shadows pass the new royal\r\nuniversity. Bridie! Bridie Kelly! He will never forget the name, ever\r\nremember the night: first night, the bridenight. They are entwined\r\nin nethermost darkness, the willer with the willed, and in an instant\r\n(fiat!) light shall flood the world. Did heart leap to heart? Nay, fair\r\nreader. In a breath \xe2\x80\x98twas done but\xe2\x80\x94hold! Back! It must not be! In terror\r\nthe poor girl flees away through the murk. She is the bride of darkness,\r\na daughter of night. She dare not bear the sunnygolden babe of day. No,\r\nLeopold. Name and memory solace thee not. That youthful illusion of\r\nthy strength was taken from thee\xe2\x80\x94and in vain. No son of thy loins is by\r\nthee. There is none now to be for Leopold, what Leopold was for Rudolph.\r\n\r\nThe voices blend and fuse in clouded silence: silence that is the\r\ninfinite of space: and swiftly, silently the soul is wafted over regions\r\nof cycles of generations that have lived. A region where grey twilight\r\never descends, never falls on wide sagegreen pasturefields, shedding her\r\ndusk, scattering a perennial dew of stars. She follows her mother with\r\nungainly steps, a mare leading her fillyfoal. Twilight phantoms\r\nare they, yet moulded in prophetic grace of structure, slim shapely\r\nhaunches, a supple tendonous neck, the meek apprehensive skull. They\r\nfade, sad phantoms: all is gone. Agendath is a waste land, a home of\r\nscreechowls and the sandblind upupa. Netaim, the golden, is no more. And\r\non the highway of the clouds they come, muttering thunder of rebellion,\r\nthe ghosts of beasts. Huuh! Hark! Huuh! Parallax stalks behind and goads\r\nthem, the lancinating lightnings of whose brow are scorpions. Elk and\r\nyak, the bulls of Bashan and of Babylon, mammoth and mastodon, they come\r\ntrooping to the sunken sea, Lacus Mortis. Ominous revengeful zodiacal\r\nhost! They moan, passing upon the clouds, horned and capricorned, the\r\ntrumpeted with the tusked, the lionmaned, the giantantlered, snouter\r\nand crawler, rodent, ruminant and pachyderm, all their moving moaning\r\nmultitude, murderers of the sun.\r\n\r\nOnward to the dead sea they tramp to drink, unslaked and with horrible\r\ngulpings, the salt somnolent inexhaustible flood. And the equine portent\r\ngrows again, magnified in the deserted heavens, nay to heaven\xe2\x80\x99s own\r\nmagnitude, till it looms, vast, over the house of Virgo. And lo, wonder\r\nof metempsychosis, it is she, the everlasting bride, harbinger of the\r\ndaystar, the bride, ever virgin. It is she, Martha, thou lost one,\r\nMillicent, the young, the dear, the radiant. How serene does she now\r\narise, a queen among the Pleiades, in the penultimate antelucan hour,\r\nshod in sandals of bright gold, coifed with a veil of what do you call\r\nit gossamer. It floats, it flows about her starborn flesh and loose it\r\nstreams, emerald, sapphire, mauve and heliotrope, sustained on currents\r\nof the cold interstellar wind, winding, coiling, simply swirling,\r\nwrithing in the skies a mysterious writing till, after a myriad\r\nmetamorphoses of symbol, it blazes, Alpha, a ruby and triangled sign\r\nupon the forehead of Taurus.\r\n\r\nFrancis was reminding Stephen of years before when they had been at\r\nschool together in Conmee\xe2\x80\x99s time. He asked about Glaucon, Alcibiades,\r\nPisistratus. Where were they now? Neither knew. You have spoken of the\r\npast and its phantoms, Stephen said. Why think of them? If I call them\r\ninto life across the waters of Lethe will not the poor ghosts troop to\r\nmy call? Who supposes it? I, Bous Stephanoumenos, bullockbefriending\r\nbard, am lord and giver of their life. He encircled his gadding hair\r\nwith a coronal of vineleaves, smiling at Vincent. That answer and those\r\nleaves, Vincent said to him, will adorn you more fitly when something\r\nmore, and greatly more, than a capful of light odes can call your genius\r\nfather. All who wish you well hope this for you. All desire to see\r\nyou bring forth the work you meditate, to acclaim you Stephaneforos. I\r\nheartily wish you may not fail them. O no, Vincent Lenehan said, laying\r\na hand on the shoulder near him. Have no fear. He could not leave his\r\nmother an orphan. The young man\xe2\x80\x99s face grew dark. All could see how hard\r\nit was for him to be reminded of his promise and of his recent loss. He\r\nwould have withdrawn from the feast had not the noise of voices allayed\r\nthe smart. Madden had lost five drachmas on Sceptre for a whim of the\r\nrider\xe2\x80\x99s name: Lenehan as much more. He told them of the race. The flag\r\nfell and, huuh! off, scamper, the mare ran out freshly with O. Madden\r\nup. She was leading the field. All hearts were beating. Even Phyllis\r\ncould not contain herself. She waved her scarf and cried: Huzzah!\r\nSceptre wins! But in the straight on the run home when all were in close\r\norder the dark horse Throwaway drew level, reached, outstripped her. All\r\nwas lost now. Phyllis was silent: her eyes were sad anemones. Juno, she\r\ncried, I am undone. But her lover consoled her and brought her a bright\r\ncasket of gold in which lay some oval sugarplums which she partook. A\r\ntear fell: one only. A whacking fine whip, said Lenehan, is W. Lane.\r\nFour winners yesterday and three today. What rider is like him? Mount\r\nhim on the camel or the boisterous buffalo the victory in a hack canter\r\nis still his. But let us bear it as was the ancient wont. Mercy on the\r\nluckless! Poor Sceptre! he said with a light sigh. She is not the filly\r\nthat she was. Never, by this hand, shall we behold such another. By gad,\r\nsir, a queen of them. Do you remember her, Vincent? I wish you could\r\nhave seen my queen today, Vincent said. How young she was and radiant\r\n(Lalage were scarce fair beside her) in her yellow shoes and frock of\r\nmuslin, I do not know the right name of it. The chestnuts that shaded\r\nus were in bloom: the air drooped with their persuasive odour and with\r\npollen floating by us. In the sunny patches one might easily have\r\ncooked on a stone a batch of those buns with Corinth fruit in them that\r\nPeriplipomenes sells in his booth near the bridge. But she had nought\r\nfor her teeth but the arm with which I held her and in that she nibbled\r\nmischievously when I pressed too close. A week ago she lay ill, four\r\ndays on the couch, but today she was free, blithe, mocked at peril.\r\nShe is more taking then. Her posies too! Mad romp that she is, she had\r\npulled her fill as we reclined together. And in your ear, my friend, you\r\nwill not think who met us as we left the field. Conmee himself! He was\r\nwalking by the hedge, reading, I think a brevier book with, I doubt not,\r\na witty letter in it from Glycera or Chloe to keep the page. The sweet\r\ncreature turned all colours in her confusion, feigning to reprove a\r\nslight disorder in her dress: a slip of underwood clung there for the\r\nvery trees adore her. When Conmee had passed she glanced at her lovely\r\necho in that little mirror she carries. But he had been kind. In going\r\nby he had blessed us. The gods too are ever kind, Lenehan said. If I had\r\npoor luck with Bass\xe2\x80\x99s mare perhaps this draught of his may serve me more\r\npropensely. He was laying his hand upon a winejar: Malachi saw it and\r\nwithheld his act, pointing to the stranger and to the scarlet label.\r\nWarily, Malachi whispered, preserve a druid silence. His soul is far\r\naway. It is as painful perhaps to be awakened from a vision as to be\r\nborn. Any object, intensely regarded, may be a gate of access to the\r\nincorruptible eon of the gods. Do you not think it, Stephen? Theosophos\r\ntold me so, Stephen answered, whom in a previous existence Egyptian\r\npriests initiated into the mysteries of karmic law. The lords of the\r\nmoon, Theosophos told me, an orangefiery shipload from planet Alpha\r\nof the lunar chain would not assume the etheric doubles and these\r\nwere therefore incarnated by the rubycoloured egos from the second\r\nconstellation.\r\n\r\nHowever, as a matter of fact though, the preposterous surmise about him\r\nbeing in some description of a doldrums or other or mesmerised which was\r\nentirely due to a misconception of the shallowest character, was not\r\nthe case at all. The individual whose visual organs while the above\r\nwas going on were at this juncture commencing to exhibit symptoms of\r\nanimation was as astute if not astuter than any man living and anybody\r\nthat conjectured the contrary would have found themselves pretty\r\nspeedily in the wrong shop. During the past four minutes or thereabouts\r\nhe had been staring hard at a certain amount of number one Bass bottled\r\nby Messrs Bass and Co at Burton-on-Trent which happened to be situated\r\namongst a lot of others right opposite to where he was and which was\r\ncertainly calculated to attract anyone\xe2\x80\x99s remark on account of its\r\nscarlet appearance. He was simply and solely, as it subsequently\r\ntranspired for reasons best known to himself, which put quite an\r\naltogether different complexion on the proceedings, after the moment\r\nbefore\xe2\x80\x99s observations about boyhood days and the turf, recollecting two\r\nor three private transactions of his own which the other two were as\r\nmutually innocent of as the babe unborn. Eventually, however, both\r\ntheir eyes met and as soon as it began to dawn on him that the other was\r\nendeavouring to help himself to the thing he involuntarily determined\r\nto help him himself and so he accordingly took hold of the neck of the\r\nmediumsized glass recipient which contained the fluid sought after and\r\nmade a capacious hole in it by pouring a lot of it out with, also at the\r\nsame time, however, a considerable degree of attentiveness in order not\r\nto upset any of the beer that was in it about the place.\r\n\r\nThe debate which ensued was in its scope and progress an epitome of the\r\ncourse of life. Neither place nor council was lacking in dignity. The\r\ndebaters were the keenest in the land, the theme they were engaged on\r\nthe loftiest and most vital. The high hall of Horne\xe2\x80\x99s house had never\r\nbeheld an assembly so representative and so varied nor had the\r\nold rafters of that establishment ever listened to a language so\r\nencyclopaedic. A gallant scene in truth it made. Crotthers was there at\r\nthe foot of the table in his striking Highland garb, his face glowing\r\nfrom the briny airs of the Mull of Galloway. There too, opposite to him,\r\nwas Lynch whose countenance bore already the stigmata of early depravity\r\nand premature wisdom. Next the Scotchman was the place assigned to\r\nCostello, the eccentric, while at his side was seated in stolid repose\r\nthe squat form of Madden. The chair of the resident indeed stood vacant\r\nbefore the hearth but on either flank of it the figure of Bannon in\r\nexplorer\xe2\x80\x99s kit of tweed shorts and salted cowhide brogues contrasted\r\nsharply with the primrose elegance and townbred manners of Malachi\r\nRoland St John Mulligan. Lastly at the head of the board was the young\r\npoet who found a refuge from his labours of pedagogy and metaphysical\r\ninquisition in the convivial atmosphere of Socratic discussion, while\r\nto right and left of him were accommodated the flippant prognosticator,\r\nfresh from the hippodrome, and that vigilant wanderer, soiled by the\r\ndust of travel and combat and stained by the mire of an indelible\r\ndishonour, but from whose steadfast and constant heart no lure or peril\r\nor threat or degradation could ever efface the image of that voluptuous\r\nloveliness which the inspired pencil of Lafayette has limned for ages\r\nyet to come.\r\n\r\nIt had better be stated here and now at the outset that the perverted\r\ntranscendentalism to which Mr S. Dedalus\xe2\x80\x99 (Div. Scep.) contentions\r\nwould appear to prove him pretty badly addicted runs directly counter to\r\naccepted scientific methods. Science, it cannot be too often repeated,\r\ndeals with tangible phenomena. The man of science like the man in the\r\nstreet has to face hardheaded facts that cannot be blinked and explain\r\nthem as best he can. There may be, it is true, some questions which\r\nscience cannot answer\xe2\x80\x94at present\xe2\x80\x94such as the first problem submitted\r\nby Mr L. Bloom (Pubb. Canv.) regarding the future determination of sex.\r\nMust we accept the view of Empedocles of Trinacria that the right ovary\r\n(the postmenstrual period, assert others) is responsible for the birth\r\nof males or are the too long neglected spermatozoa or nemasperms the\r\ndifferentiating factors or is it, as most embryologists incline to\r\nopine, such as Culpepper, Spallanzani, Blumenbach, Lusk, Hertwig,\r\nLeopold and Valenti, a mixture of both? This would be tantamount to\r\na cooperation (one of nature\xe2\x80\x99s favourite devices) between the nisus\r\nformativus of the nemasperm on the one hand and on the other a happily\r\nchosen position, succubitus felix, of the passive element. The other\r\nproblem raised by the same inquirer is scarcely less vital: infant\r\nmortality. It is interesting because, as he pertinently remarks, we\r\nare all born in the same way but we all die in different ways. Mr M.\r\nMulligan (Hyg. et Eug. Doc.) blames the sanitary conditions in which\r\nour greylunged citizens contract adenoids, pulmonary complaints etc. by\r\ninhaling the bacteria which lurk in dust. These factors, he alleged,\r\nand the revolting spectacles offered by our streets, hideous publicity\r\nposters, religious ministers of all denominations, mutilated soldiers\r\nand sailors, exposed scorbutic cardrivers, the suspended carcases of\r\ndead animals, paranoic bachelors and unfructified duennas\xe2\x80\x94these, he\r\nsaid, were accountable for any and every fallingoff in the calibre of\r\nthe race. Kalipedia, he prophesied, would soon be generally adopted\r\nand all the graces of life, genuinely good music, agreeable literature,\r\nlight philosophy, instructive pictures, plastercast reproductions of\r\nthe classical statues such as Venus and Apollo, artistic coloured\r\nphotographs of prize babies, all these little attentions would enable\r\nladies who were in a particular condition to pass the intervening months\r\nin a most enjoyable manner. Mr J. Crotthers (Disc. Bacc.) attributes\r\nsome of these demises to abdominal trauma in the case of women workers\r\nsubjected to heavy labours in the workshop and to marital discipline in\r\nthe home but by far the vast majority to neglect, private or official,\r\nculminating in the exposure of newborn infants, the practice of criminal\r\nabortion or in the atrocious crime of infanticide. Although the former\r\n(we are thinking of neglect) is undoubtedly only too true the case he\r\ncites of nurses forgetting to count the sponges in the peritoneal cavity\r\nis too rare to be normative. In fact when one comes to look into it the\r\nwonder is that so many pregnancies and deliveries go off so well as they\r\ndo, all things considered and in spite of our human shortcomings which\r\noften baulk nature in her intentions. An ingenious suggestion is\r\nthat thrown out by Mr V. Lynch (Bacc. Arith.) that both natality and\r\nmortality, as well as all other phenomena of evolution, tidal movements,\r\nlunar phases, blood temperatures, diseases in general, everything, in\r\nfine, in nature\xe2\x80\x99s vast workshop from the extinction of some remote sun\r\nto the blossoming of one of the countless flowers which beautify our\r\npublic parks is subject to a law of numeration as yet unascertained.\r\nStill the plain straightforward question why a child of normally healthy\r\nparents and seemingly a healthy child and properly looked after succumbs\r\nunaccountably in early childhood (though other children of the same\r\nmarriage do not) must certainly, in the poet\xe2\x80\x99s words, give us pause.\r\nNature, we may rest assured, has her own good and cogent reasons for\r\nwhatever she does and in all probability such deaths are due to some law\r\nof anticipation by which organisms in which morbous germs have taken\r\nup their residence (modern science has conclusively shown that only the\r\nplasmic substance can be said to be immortal) tend to disappear at an\r\nincreasingly earlier stage of development, an arrangement which, though\r\nproductive of pain to some of our feelings (notably the maternal), is\r\nnevertheless, some of us think, in the long run beneficial to the\r\nrace in general in securing thereby the survival of the fittest. Mr S.\r\nDedalus\xe2\x80\x99 (Div. Scep.) remark (or should it be called an interruption?)\r\nthat an omnivorous being which can masticate, deglute, digest and\r\napparently pass through the ordinary channel with pluterperfect\r\nimperturbability such multifarious aliments as cancrenous females\r\nemaciated by parturition, corpulent professional gentlemen, not to speak\r\nof jaundiced politicians and chlorotic nuns, might possibly find gastric\r\nrelief in an innocent collation of staggering bob, reveals as nought\r\nelse could and in a very unsavoury light the tendency above alluded to.\r\nFor the enlightenment of those who are not so intimately acquainted with\r\nthe minutiae of the municipal abattoir as this morbidminded esthete and\r\nembryo philosopher who for all his overweening bumptiousness in things\r\nscientific can scarcely distinguish an acid from an alkali prides\r\nhimself on being, it should perhaps be stated that staggering bob in\r\nthe vile parlance of our lowerclass licensed victuallers signifies the\r\ncookable and eatable flesh of a calf newly dropped from its mother. In\r\na recent public controversy with Mr L. Bloom (Pubb. Canv.) which took\r\nplace in the commons\xe2\x80\x99 hall of the National Maternity Hospital, 29, 30\r\nand 31 Holles street, of which, as is well known, Dr A. Horne (Lic. in\r\nMidw., F. K. Q. C. P. I.) is the able and popular master, he is reported\r\nby eyewitnesses as having stated that once a woman has let the cat\r\ninto the bag (an esthete\xe2\x80\x99s allusion, presumably, to one of the most\r\ncomplicated and marvellous of all nature\xe2\x80\x99s processes\xe2\x80\x94the act of sexual\r\ncongress) she must let it out again or give it life, as he phrased it,\r\nto save her own. At the risk of her own, was the telling rejoinder of\r\nhis interlocutor, none the less effective for the moderate and measured\r\ntone in which it was delivered.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the skill and patience of the physician had brought about a\r\nhappy accouchement. It had been a weary weary while both for patient and\r\ndoctor. All that surgical skill could do was done and the brave woman\r\nhad manfully helped. She had. She had fought the good fight and now she\r\nwas very very happy. Those who have passed on, who have gone before,\r\nare happy too as they gaze down and smile upon the touching scene.\r\nReverently look at her as she reclines there with the motherlight in\r\nher eyes, that longing hunger for baby fingers (a pretty sight it is\r\nto see), in the first bloom of her new motherhood, breathing a silent\r\nprayer of thanksgiving to One above, the Universal Husband. And as her\r\nloving eyes behold her babe she wishes only one blessing more, to have\r\nher dear Doady there with her to share her joy, to lay in his arms that\r\nmite of God\xe2\x80\x99s clay, the fruit of their lawful embraces. He is older now\r\n(you and I may whisper it) and a trifle stooped in the shoulders yet\r\nin the whirligig of years a grave dignity has come to the conscientious\r\nsecond accountant of the Ulster bank, College Green branch. O Doady,\r\nloved one of old, faithful lifemate now, it may never be again, that\r\nfaroff time of the roses! With the old shake of her pretty head she\r\nrecalls those days. God! How beautiful now across the mist of years! But\r\ntheir children are grouped in her imagination about the bedside, hers\r\nand his, Charley, Mary Alice, Frederick Albert (if he had lived), Mamy,\r\nBudgy (Victoria Frances), Tom, Violet Constance Louisa, darling little\r\nBobsy (called after our famous hero of the South African war, lord Bobs\r\nof Waterford and Candahar) and now this last pledge of their union, a\r\nPurefoy if ever there was one, with the true Purefoy nose. Young hopeful\r\nwill be christened Mortimer Edward after the influential third cousin of\r\nMr Purefoy in the Treasury Remembrancer\xe2\x80\x99s office, Dublin Castle. And so\r\ntime wags on: but father Cronion has dealt lightly here. No, let no sigh\r\nbreak from that bosom, dear gentle Mina. And Doady, knock the ashes from\r\nyour pipe, the seasoned briar you still fancy when the curfew rings for\r\nyou (may it be the distant day!) and dout the light whereby you read\r\nin the Sacred Book for the oil too has run low, and so with a tranquil\r\nheart to bed, to rest. He knows and will call in His own good time. You\r\ntoo have fought the good fight and played loyally your man\xe2\x80\x99s part. Sir,\r\nto you my hand. Well done, thou good and faithful servant!\r\n\r\nThere are sins or (let us call them as the world calls them) evil\r\nmemories which are hidden away by man in the darkest places of the heart\r\nbut they abide there and wait. He may suffer their memory to grow dim,\r\nlet them be as though they had not been and all but persuade himself\r\nthat they were not or at least were otherwise. Yet a chance word will\r\ncall them forth suddenly and they will rise up to confront him in the\r\nmost various circumstances, a vision or a dream, or while timbrel\r\nand harp soothe his senses or amid the cool silver tranquility of the\r\nevening or at the feast, at midnight, when he is now filled with wine.\r\nNot to insult over him will the vision come as over one that lies under\r\nher wrath, not for vengeance to cut him off from the living but shrouded\r\nin the piteous vesture of the past, silent, remote, reproachful.\r\n\r\nThe stranger still regarded on the face before him a slow recession of\r\nthat false calm there, imposed, as it seemed, by habit or some studied\r\ntrick, upon words so embittered as to accuse in their speaker an\r\nunhealthiness, a flair, for the cruder things of life. A scene\r\ndisengages itself in the observer\xe2\x80\x99s memory, evoked, it would seem, by\r\na word of so natural a homeliness as if those days were really present\r\nthere (as some thought) with their immediate pleasures. A shaven space\r\nof lawn one soft May evening, the wellremembered grove of lilacs at\r\nRoundtown, purple and white, fragrant slender spectators of the game but\r\nwith much real interest in the pellets as they run slowly forward over\r\nthe sward or collide and stop, one by its fellow, with a brief alert\r\nshock. And yonder about that grey urn where the water moves at times\r\nin thoughtful irrigation you saw another as fragrant sisterhood, Floey,\r\nAtty, Tiny and their darker friend with I know not what of arresting in\r\nher pose then, Our Lady of the Cherries, a comely brace of them pendent\r\nfrom an ear, bringing out the foreign warmth of the skin so daintily\r\nagainst the cool ardent fruit. A lad of four or five in linseywoolsey\r\n(blossomtime but there will be cheer in the kindly hearth when ere long\r\nthe bowls are gathered and hutched) is standing on the urn secured by\r\nthat circle of girlish fond hands. He frowns a little just as this young\r\nman does now with a perhaps too conscious enjoyment of the danger but\r\nmust needs glance at whiles towards where his mother watches from the\r\npiazzetta giving upon the flowerclose with a faint shadow of remoteness\r\nor of reproach (alles Verg\xc3\xa4ngliche) in her glad look.\r\n\r\nMark this farther and remember. The end comes suddenly. Enter that\r\nantechamber of birth where the studious are assembled and note their\r\nfaces. Nothing, as it seems, there of rash or violent. Quietude of\r\ncustody, rather, befitting their station in that house, the vigilant\r\nwatch of shepherds and of angels about a crib in Bethlehem of Juda long\r\nago. But as before the lightning the serried stormclouds, heavy with\r\npreponderant excess of moisture, in swollen masses turgidly distended,\r\ncompass earth and sky in one vast slumber, impending above parched field\r\nand drowsy oxen and blighted growth of shrub and verdure till in an\r\ninstant a flash rives their centres and with the reverberation of the\r\nthunder the cloudburst pours its torrent, so and not otherwise was the\r\ntransformation, violent and instantaneous, upon the utterance of the\r\nword.\r\n\r\nBurke\xe2\x80\x99s! outflings my lord Stephen, giving the cry, and a tag and\r\nbobtail of all them after, cockerel, jackanapes, welsher, pilldoctor,\r\npunctual Bloom at heels with a universal grabbing at headgear,\r\nashplants, bilbos, Panama hats and scabbards, Zermatt alpenstocks and\r\nwhat not. A dedale of lusty youth, noble every student there. Nurse\r\nCallan taken aback in the hallway cannot stay them nor smiling surgeon\r\ncoming downstairs with news of placentation ended, a full pound if a\r\nmilligramme. They hark him on. The door! It is open? Ha! They are out,\r\ntumultuously, off for a minute\xe2\x80\x99s race, all bravely legging it, Burke\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nof Denzille and Holles their ulterior goal. Dixon follows giving them\r\nsharp language but raps out an oath, he too, and on. Bloom stays with\r\nnurse a thought to send a kind word to happy mother and nurseling up\r\nthere. Doctor Diet and Doctor Quiet. Looks she too not other now? Ward\r\nof watching in Horne\xe2\x80\x99s house has told its tale in that washedout pallor.\r\nThen all being gone, a glance of motherwit helping, he whispers close in\r\ngoing: Madam, when comes the storkbird for thee?\r\n\r\nThe air without is impregnated with raindew moisture, life essence\r\ncelestial, glistening on Dublin stone there under starshiny coelum.\r\nGod\xe2\x80\x99s air, the Allfather\xe2\x80\x99s air, scintillant circumambient cessile air.\r\nBreathe it deep into thee. By heaven, Theodore Purefoy, thou hast done a\r\ndoughty deed and no botch! Thou art, I vow, the remarkablest progenitor\r\nbarring none in this chaffering allincluding most farraginous chronicle.\r\nAstounding! In her lay a Godframed Godgiven preformed possibility which\r\nthou hast fructified with thy modicum of man\xe2\x80\x99s work. Cleave to her!\r\nServe! Toil on, labour like a very bandog and let scholarment and all\r\nMalthusiasts go hang. Thou art all their daddies, Theodore. Art drooping\r\nunder thy load, bemoiled with butcher\xe2\x80\x99s bills at home and ingots (not\r\nthine!) in the countinghouse? Head up! For every newbegotten thou shalt\r\ngather thy homer of ripe wheat. See, thy fleece is drenched. Dost envy\r\nDarby Dullman there with his Joan? A canting jay and a rheumeyed\r\ncurdog is all their progeny. Pshaw, I tell thee! He is a mule, a dead\r\ngasteropod, without vim or stamina, not worth a cracked kreutzer.\r\nCopulation without population! No, say I! Herod\xe2\x80\x99s slaughter of the\r\ninnocents were the truer name. Vegetables, forsooth, and sterile\r\ncohabitation! Give her beefsteaks, red, raw, bleeding! She is a hoary\r\npandemonium of ills, enlarged glands, mumps, quinsy, bunions, hayfever,\r\nbedsores, ringworm, floating kidney, Derbyshire neck, warts, bilious\r\nattacks, gallstones, cold feet, varicose veins. A truce to threnes and\r\ntrentals and jeremies and all such congenital defunctive music! Twenty\r\nyears of it, regret them not. With thee it was not as with many that\r\nwill and would and wait and never\xe2\x80\x94do. Thou sawest thy America, thy\r\nlifetask, and didst charge to cover like the transpontine bison. How\r\nsaith Zarathustra? Deine Kuh Tr\xc3\xbcbsal melkest Du. Nun Trinkst Du die\r\ns\xc3\xbcsse Milch des Euters. See! it displodes for thee in abundance. Drink,\r\nman, an udderful!

They grab wafers between which\r\nare wedged lumps of coral and copper snow. Sucking, they scatter slowly.\r\nChildren.

A pigmy woman swings on a rope slung\r\nbetween two railings, counting. A form sprawled against a dustbin and\r\nmuffled by its arm and hat snores, groans, grinding growling teeth, and\r\nsnores again. On a step a gnome totting among a rubbishtip crouches\r\nto shoulder a sack of rags and bones. A crone standing by with a smoky\r\noillamp rams her last bottle in the maw of his sack. He heaves his\r\nbooty, tugs askew his peaked cap and hobbles off mutely. The crone\r\nmakes back for her lair, swaying her lamp. A bandy child, asquat on the\r\ndoorstep with a paper shuttlecock, crawls sidling after her in spurts,\r\nclutches her skirt, scrambles up. A drunken navvy grips with both hands\r\nthe railings of an area, lurching heavily. At a corner two night watch\r\nin shouldercapes, their hands upon their staffholsters, loom tall. A\r\nplate crashes: a woman screams: a child wails. Oaths of a man roar,\r\nmutter, cease. Figures wander, lurk, peer from warrens. In a room lit by\r\na candle stuck in a bottleneck a slut combs out the tatts from the hair\r\nof a scrofulous child.

Salvi facti sunt.\r\n\r\n(He flourishes his ashplant, shivering the lamp image, shattering light\r\nover the world. A liver and white spaniel on the prowl slinks after him,\r\ngrowling. Lynch scares it with a kick.)\r\n\r\nLYNCH: So that?\r\n\r\nSTEPHEN: (Looks behind.) So that gesture, not music not odour, would be\r\na universal language, the gift of tongues rendering visible not the lay\r\nsense but the first entelechy, the structural rhythm.\r\n\r\nLYNCH: Pornosophical philotheology.

Where are we going?\r\n\r\nSTEPHEN: Lecherous lynx, to la belle dame sans merci, Georgina Johnson,\r\nad deam qui laetificat iuventutem meam.\r\n\r\n(Stephen thrusts the ashplant on him and slowly holds out his hands, his\r\nhead going back till both hands are a span from his breast, down turned,\r\nin planes intersecting, the fingers about to part, the left being\r\nhigher.)\r\n\r\nLYNCH: Which is the jug of bread? It skills not. That or the\r\ncustomhouse. Illustrate thou. Here take your crutch and walk.\r\n\r\n(They pass. Tommy Caffrey scrambles to a gaslamp and, clasping, climbs\r\nin spasms. From the top spur he slides down. Jacky Caffrey clasps to\r\nclimb. The navvy lurches against the lamp. The twins scuttle off in the\r\ndark. The navvy, swaying, presses a forefinger against a wing of his\r\nnose and ejects from the farther nostril a long liquid jet of snot.\r\nShouldering the lamp he staggers away through the crowd with his flaring\r\ncresset.\r\n\r\nSnakes of river fog creep slowly. From drains, clefts, cesspools,\r\nmiddens arise on all sides stagnant fumes. A glow leaps in the south\r\nbeyond the seaward reaches of the river. The navvy, staggering forward,\r\ncleaves the crowd and lurches towards the tramsiding. On the farther\r\nside under the railway bridge Bloom appears, flushed, panting, cramming\r\nbread and chocolate into a sidepocket. From Gillen\xe2\x80\x99s hairdresser\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwindow a composite portrait shows him gallant Nelson\xe2\x80\x99s image. A concave\r\nmirror at the side presents to him lovelorn longlost lugubru Booloohoom.\r\nGrave Gladstone sees him level, Bloom for Bloom. He passes, struck\r\nby the stare of truculent Wellington, but in the convex mirror grin\r\nunstruck the bonham eyes and fatchuck cheekchops of Jollypoldy the\r\nrixdix doldy.\r\n\r\nAt Antonio Rabaiotti\xe2\x80\x99s door Bloom halts, sweated under the bright\r\narclamp. He disappears. In a moment he reappears and hurries on.)\r\n\r\nBLOOM: Fish and taters. N. g. Ah!\r\n\r\n(He disappears into Olhausen\xe2\x80\x99s, the porkbutcher\xe2\x80\x99s, under the downcoming\r\nrollshutter. A few moments later he emerges from under the shutter,\r\npuffing Poldy, blowing Bloohoom. In each hand he holds a parcel, one\r\ncontaining a lukewarm pig\xe2\x80\x99s crubeen, the other a cold sheep\xe2\x80\x99s trotter,\r\nsprinkled with wholepepper. He gasps, standing upright. Then bending to\r\none side he presses a parcel against his ribs and groans.)\r\n\r\nBLOOM: Stitch in my side. Why did I run?\r\n\r\n(He takes breath with care and goes forward slowly towards the lampset\r\nsiding. The glow leaps again.)\r\n\r\nBLOOM: What is that? A flasher? Searchlight.\r\n\r\n(He stands at Cormack\xe2\x80\x99s corner, watching.)\r\n\r\nBLOOM: Aurora borealis or a steel foundry? Ah, the brigade, of course.\r\nSouth side anyhow. Big blaze. Might be his house. Beggar\xe2\x80\x99s bush. We\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nsafe. (He hums cheerfully.) London\xe2\x80\x99s burning, London\xe2\x80\x99s burning! On fire,\r\non fire! (He catches sight of the navvy lurching through the crowd at\r\nthe farther side of Talbot street.) I\xe2\x80\x99ll miss him. Run. Quick. Better\r\ncross here.\r\n\r\n(He darts to cross the road. Urchins shout.)\r\n\r\nTHE URCHINS: Mind out, mister!\r\n\r\n(Two cyclists, with lighted paper lanterns aswing, swim by him, grazing\r\nhim, their bells rattling.)\r\n\r\nTHE BELLS: Haltyaltyaltyall.\r\n\r\nBLOOM: (Halts erect, stung by a spasm.) Ow!\r\n\r\n(He looks round, darts forward suddenly. Through rising fog a dragon\r\nsandstrewer, travelling at caution, slews heavily down upon him,\r\nits huge red headlight winking, its trolley hissing on the wire. The\r\nmotorman bangs his footgong.)\r\n\r\nTHE GONG: Bang Bang Bla Bak Blud Bugg Bloo.\r\n\r\n(The brake cracks violently. Bloom, raising a policeman\xe2\x80\x99s whitegloved\r\nhand, blunders stifflegged out of the track. The motorman, thrown\r\nforward, pugnosed, on the guidewheel, yells as he slides past over\r\nchains and keys.)\r\n\r\nTHE MOTORMAN: Hey, shitbreeches, are you doing the hat trick?\r\n\r\n(Bloom trickleaps to the curbstone and halts again. He brushes a\r\nmudflake from his cheek with a parcelled hand.)\r\n\r\nBLOOM: No thoroughfare. Close shave that but cured the stitch. Must take\r\nup Sandow\xe2\x80\x99s exercises again. On the hands down. Insure against street\r\naccident too. The Providential. (He feels his trouser pocket.) Poor\r\nmamma\xe2\x80\x99s panacea. Heel easily catch in track or bootlace in a cog. Day\r\nthe wheel of the black Maria peeled off my shoe at Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s corner.\r\nThird time is the charm. Shoe trick. Insolent driver. I ought to report\r\nhim. Tension makes them nervous. Might be the fellow balked me this\r\nmorning with that horsey woman. Same style of beauty. Quick of him all\r\nthe same. The stiff walk. True word spoken in jest. That awful cramp in\r\nLad lane. Something poisonous I ate. Emblem of luck. Why? Probably lost\r\ncattle. Mark of the beast. (He closes his eyes an instant.) Bit light\r\nin the head. Monthly or effect of the other. Brainfogfag. That tired\r\nfeeling. Too much for me now. Ow!\r\n\r\n(A sinister figure leans on plaited legs against O\xe2\x80\x99Beirne\xe2\x80\x99s wall, a\r\nvisage unknown, injected with dark mercury. From under a wideleaved\r\nsombrero the figure regards him with evil eye.)\r\n\r\nBLOOM: Buenas noches, se\xc3\xb1orita Blanca, que calle es esta?\r\n\r\nTHE FIGURE: (Impassive, raises a signal arm.) Password. Sraid Mabbot.\r\n\r\nBLOOM: Haha. Merci. Esperanto. Slan leath. (He mutters.) Gaelic league\r\nspy, sent by that fireeater.\r\n\r\n(He steps forward. A sackshouldered ragman bars his path. He steps left,\r\nragsackman left.)\r\n\r\nBLOOM: I beg.\r\n\r\n(He leaps right, sackragman right.)\r\n\r\nBLOOM: I beg.\r\n\r\n(He swerves, sidles, stepaside, slips past and on.)\r\n\r\nBLOOM: Keep to the right, right, right. If there is a signpost planted\r\nby the Touring Club at Stepaside who procured that public boon? I who\r\nlost my way and contributed to the columns of the Irish Cyclist the\r\nletter headed In darkest Stepaside. Keep, keep, keep to the right. Rags\r\nand bones at midnight. A fence more likely. First place murderer makes\r\nfor. Wash off his sins of the world.\r\n\r\n(Jacky Caffrey, hunted by Tommy Caffrey, runs full tilt against Bloom.)\r\n\r\nBLOOM: O.\r\n\r\n(Shocked, on weak hams, he halts. Tommy and Jacky vanish there, there.\r\nBloom pats with parcelled hands watch, fobpocket, bookpocket, pursepoke,\r\nsweets of sin, potato soap.)\r\n\r\nBLOOM: Beware of pickpockets. Old thieves\xe2\x80\x99 dodge. Collide. Then snatch\r\nyour purse.\r\n\r\n(The retriever approaches sniffing, nose to the ground. A sprawled form\r\nsneezes. A stooped bearded figure appears garbed in the long caftan\r\nof an elder in Zion and a smokingcap with magenta tassels. Horned\r\nspectacles hang down at the wings of the nose. Yellow poison streaks are\r\non the drawn face.)\r\n\r\nRUDOLPH: Second halfcrown waste money today. I told you not go with\r\ndrunken goy ever. So you catch no money.\r\n\r\nBLOOM: (Hides the crubeen and trotter behind his back and, crestfallen,\r\nfeels warm and cold feetmeat.) Ja, ich weiss, papachi.\r\n\r\nRUDOLPH: What you making down this place? Have you no soul? (With feeble\r\nvulture talons he feels the silent face of Bloom.) Are you not my son\r\nLeopold, the grandson of Leopold? Are you not my dear son Leopold who\r\nleft the house of his father and left the god of his fathers Abraham and\r\nJacob?\r\n\r\nBLOOM: (With precaution.) I suppose so, father. Mosenthal. All that\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nleft of him.\r\n\r\nRUDOLPH: (Severely.) One night they bring you home drunk as dog after\r\nspend your good money. What you call them running chaps?\r\n\r\nBLOOM: (In youth\xe2\x80\x99s smart blue Oxford suit with white vestslips,\r\nnarrowshouldered, in brown Alpine hat, wearing gent\xe2\x80\x99s sterling silver\r\nwaterbury keyless watch and double curb Albert with seal attached, one\r\nside of him coated with stiffening mud.) Harriers, father. Only that\r\nonce.\r\n\r\nRUDOLPH: Once! Mud head to foot. Cut your hand open. Lockjaw. They make\r\nyou kaputt, Leopoldleben. You watch them chaps.\r\n\r\nBLOOM: (Weakly.) They challenged me to a sprint. It was muddy. I\r\nslipped.\r\n\r\nRUDOLPH: (With contempt.) Goim nachez! Nice spectacles for your poor\r\nmother!\r\n\r\nBLOOM: Mamma!\r\n\r\nELLEN BLOOM: (In pantomime dame\xe2\x80\x99s stringed mobcap, widow Twankey\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncrinoline and bustle, blouse with muttonleg sleeves buttoned behind,\r\ngrey mittens and cameo brooch, her plaited hair in a crispine net,\r\nappears over the staircase banisters, a slanted candlestick in her hand,\r\nand cries out in shrill alarm.) O blessed Redeemer, what have they done\r\nto him! My smelling salts! (She hauls up a reef of skirt and ransacks\r\nthe pouch of her striped blay petticoat. A phial, an Agnus Dei, a\r\nshrivelled potato and a celluloid doll fall out.) Sacred Heart of Mary,\r\nwhere were you at all at all?\r\n\r\n(Bloom, mumbling, his eyes downcast, begins to bestow his parcels in his\r\nfilled pockets but desists, muttering.)\r\n\r\nA VOICE: (Sharply.) Poldy!\r\n\r\nBLOOM: Who? (He ducks and wards off a blow clumsily.) At your service.\r\n\r\n(He looks up. Beside her mirage of datepalms a handsome woman in Turkish\r\ncostume stands before him. Opulent curves fill out her scarlet trousers\r\nand jacket, slashed with gold. A wide yellow cummerbund girdles her. A\r\nwhite yashmak, violet in the night, covers her face, leaving free only\r\nher large dark eyes and raven hair.)\r\n\r\nBLOOM: Molly!\r\n\r\nMARION: Welly? Mrs Marion from this out, my dear man, when you speak to\r\nme. (Satirically.) Has poor little hubby cold feet waiting so long?\r\n\r\nBLOOM: (Shifts from foot to foot.) No, no. Not the least little bit.\r\n\r\n(He breathes in deep agitation, swallowing gulps of air, questions,\r\nhopes, crubeens for her supper, things to tell her, excuse, desire,\r\nspellbound. A coin gleams on her forehead. On her feet are jewelled\r\ntoerings. Her ankles are linked by a slender fetterchain. Beside her\r\na camel, hooded with a turreting turban, waits. A silk ladder of\r\ninnumerable rungs climbs to his bobbing howdah. He ambles near with\r\ndisgruntled hindquarters. Fiercely she slaps his haunch, her goldcurb\r\nwristbangles angriling, scolding him in Moorish.)\r\n\r\nMARION: Nebrakada! Femininum!\r\n\r\n(The camel, lifting a foreleg, plucks from a tree a large mango fruit,\r\noffers it to his mistress, blinking, in his cloven hoof, then droops his\r\nhead and, grunting, with uplifted neck, fumbles to kneel. Bloom stoops\r\nhis back for leapfrog.)\r\n\r\nBLOOM: I can give you... I mean as your business menagerer... Mrs\r\nMarion... if you...\r\n\r\nMARION: So you notice some change? (Her hands passing slowly over her\r\ntrinketed stomacher, a slow friendly mockery in her eyes.) O Poldy,\r\nPoldy, you are a poor old stick in the mud! Go and see life. See the\r\nwide world.\r\n\r\nBLOOM: I was just going back for that lotion whitewax, orangeflower\r\nwater. Shop closes early on Thursday. But the first thing in the\r\nmorning. (He pats divers pockets.) This moving kidney. Ah!\r\n\r\n(He points to the south, then to the east. A cake of new clean lemon\r\nsoap arises, diffusing light and perfume.)\r\n\r\nTHE SOAP:\r\n\r\n      We\xe2\x80\x99re a capital couple are Bloom and I.\r\n      He brightens the earth. I polish the sky.\r\n\r\n(The freckled face of Sweny, the druggist, appears in the disc of the\r\nsoapsun.)\r\n\r\nSWENY: Three and a penny, please.\r\n\r\nBLOOM: Yes. For my wife. Mrs Marion. Special recipe.\r\n\r\nMARION: (Softly.) Poldy!\r\n\r\nBLOOM: Yes, ma\xe2\x80\x99am?\r\n\r\nMARION: Ti trema un poco il cuore?\r\n\r\n(In disdain she saunters away, plump as a pampered pouter pigeon,\r\nhumming the duet from Don Giovanni.)\r\n\r\nBLOOM: Are you sure about that Voglio? I mean the pronunciati...\r\n\r\n(He follows, followed by the sniffing terrier. The elderly bawd seizes\r\nhis sleeve, the bristles of her chinmole glittering.)\r\n\r\nTHE BAWD: Ten shillings a maidenhead. Fresh thing was never touched.\r\nFifteen. There\xe2\x80\x99s no-one in it only her old father that\xe2\x80\x99s dead drunk.\r\n\r\n(She points. In the gap of her dark den furtive, rainbedraggled, Bridie\r\nKelly stands.)\r\n\r\nBRIDIE: Hatch street. Any good in your mind?\r\n\r\n(With a squeak she flaps her bat shawl and runs. A burly rough pursues\r\nwith booted strides. He stumbles on the steps, recovers, plunges into\r\ngloom. Weak squeaks of laughter are heard, weaker.)\r\n\r\nTHE BAWD: (Her wolfeyes shining.) He\xe2\x80\x99s getting his pleasure. You won\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nget a virgin in the flash houses. Ten shillings. Don\xe2\x80\x99t be all night\r\nbefore the polis in plain clothes sees us. Sixtyseven is a bitch.\r\n\r\n(Leering, Gerty Macdowell limps forward. She draws from behind, ogling,\r\nand shows coyly her bloodied clout.)\r\n\r\nGERTY: With all my worldly goods I thee and thou. (She murmurs.) You did\r\nthat. I hate you.\r\n\r\nBLOOM: I? When? You\xe2\x80\x99re dreaming. I never saw you.\r\n\r\nTHE BAWD: Leave the gentleman alone, you cheat. Writing the gentleman\r\nfalse letters. Streetwalking and soliciting. Better for your mother take\r\nthe strap to you at the bedpost, hussy like you.\r\n\r\nGERTY: (To Bloom.) When you saw all the secrets of my bottom drawer.\r\n(She paws his sleeve, slobbering.) Dirty married man! I love you for\r\ndoing that to me.\r\n\r\n(She glides away crookedly. Mrs Breen in man\xe2\x80\x99s frieze overcoat with\r\nloose bellows pockets, stands in the causeway, her roguish eyes\r\nwideopen, smiling in all her herbivorous buckteeth.)\r\n\r\nMRS BREEN: Mr...\r\n\r\nBLOOM: (Coughs gravely.) Madam, when we last had this pleasure by letter\r\ndated the sixteenth instant...\r\n\r\nMRS BREEN: Mr Bloom! You down here in the haunts of sin! I caught you\r\nnicely! Scamp!\r\n\r\nBLOOM: (Hurriedly.) Not so loud my name. Whatever do you think of me?\r\nDon\xe2\x80\x99t give me away. Walls have ears. How do you do? It\xe2\x80\x99s ages since I.\r\nYou\xe2\x80\x99re looking splendid. Absolutely it. Seasonable weather we are having\r\nthis time of year. Black refracts heat. Short cut home here. Interesting\r\nquarter. Rescue of fallen women. Magdalen asylum. I am the secretary...\r\n\r\nMRS BREEN: (Holds up a finger.) Now, don\xe2\x80\x99t tell a big fib! I know\r\nsomebody won\xe2\x80\x99t like that. O just wait till I see Molly! (Slily.) Account\r\nfor yourself this very sminute or woe betide you!\r\n\r\nBLOOM: (Looks behind.) She often said she\xe2\x80\x99d like to visit. Slumming. The\r\nexotic, you see. Negro servants in livery too if she had money. Othello\r\nblack brute. Eugene Stratton. Even the bones and cornerman at the\r\nLivermore christies. Bohee brothers. Sweep for that matter.\r\n\r\n(Tom and Sam Bohee, coloured coons in white duck suits, scarlet socks,\r\nupstarched Sambo chokers and large scarlet asters in their buttonholes,\r\nleap out. Each has his banjo slung. Their paler smaller negroid hands\r\njingle the twingtwang wires. Flashing white Kaffir eyes and tusks they\r\nrattle through a breakdown in clumsy clogs, twinging, singing, back to\r\nback, toe heel, heel toe, with smackfatclacking nigger lips.)\r\n\r\nTOM AND SAM:\r\n\r\n     There\xe2\x80\x99s someone in the house with Dina\r\n     There\xe2\x80\x99s someone in the house, I know,\r\n     There\xe2\x80\x99s someone in the house with Dina\r\n     Playing on the old banjo.\r\n\r\n(They whisk black masks from raw babby faces: then, chuckling,\r\nchortling, trumming, twanging, they diddle diddle cakewalk dance away.)\r\n\r\nBLOOM: (With a sour tenderish smile.) A little frivol, shall we, if you\r\nare so inclined? Would you like me perhaps to embrace you just for a\r\nfraction of a second?\r\n\r\nMRS BREEN: (Screams gaily.) O, you ruck! You ought to see yourself!\r\n\r\nBLOOM: For old sake\xe2\x80\x99 sake. I only meant a square party, a mixed marriage\r\nmingling of our different little conjugials. You know I had a soft\r\ncorner for you. (Gloomily.) \xe2\x80\x98Twas I sent you that valentine of the dear\r\ngazelle.\r\n\r\nMRS BREEN: Glory Alice, you do look a holy show! Killing simply. (She\r\nputs out her hand inquisitively.) What are you hiding behind your back?\r\nTell us, there\xe2\x80\x99s a dear.\r\n\r\nBLOOM: (Seizes her wrist with his free hand.) Josie Powell that was,\r\nprettiest deb in Dublin. How time flies by! Do you remember, harking\r\nback in a retrospective arrangement, Old Christmas night, Georgina\r\nSimpson\xe2\x80\x99s housewarming while they were playing the Irving Bishop game,\r\nfinding the pin blindfold and thoughtreading? Subject, what is in this\r\nsnuffbox?\r\n\r\nMRS BREEN: You were the lion of the night with your seriocomic\r\nrecitation and you looked the part. You were always a favourite with the\r\nladies.\r\n\r\nBLOOM: (Squire of dames, in dinner jacket with wateredsilk facings, blue\r\nmasonic badge in his buttonhole, black bow and mother-of-pearl studs, a\r\nprismatic champagne glass tilted in his hand.) Ladies and gentlemen, I\r\ngive you Ireland, home and beauty.\r\n\r\nMRS BREEN: The dear dead days beyond recall. Love\xe2\x80\x99s old sweet song.\r\n\r\nBLOOM: (Meaningfully dropping his voice.) I confess I\xe2\x80\x99m teapot with\r\ncuriosity to find out whether some person\xe2\x80\x99s something is a little teapot\r\nat present.\r\n\r\nMRS BREEN: (Gushingly.) Tremendously teapot! London\xe2\x80\x99s teapot and I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nsimply teapot all over me! (She rubs sides with him.) After the parlour\r\nmystery games and the crackers from the tree we sat on the staircase\r\nottoman. Under the mistletoe. Two is company.\r\n\r\nBLOOM: (Wearing a purple Napoleon hat with an amber halfmoon, his\r\nfingers and thumb passing slowly down to her soft moist meaty palm which\r\nshe surrenders gently.) The witching hour of night. I took the splinter\r\nout of this hand, carefully, slowly. (Tenderly, as he slips on her\r\nfinger a ruby ring.) L\xc3\xa0 ci darem la mano.\r\n\r\nMRS BREEN: (In a onepiece evening frock executed in moonlight blue, a\r\ntinsel sylph\xe2\x80\x99s diadem on her brow with her dancecard fallen beside her\r\nmoonblue satin slipper, curves her palm softly, breathing quickly.)\r\nVoglio e non. You\xe2\x80\x99re hot! You\xe2\x80\x99re scalding! The left hand nearest the\r\nheart.\r\n\r\nBLOOM: When you made your present choice they said it was beauty and\r\nthe beast. I can never forgive you for that. (His clenched fist at his\r\nbrow.) Think what it means. All you meant to me then. (Hoarsely.) Woman,\r\nit\xe2\x80\x99s breaking me!\r\n\r\n(Denis Breen, whitetallhatted, with Wisdom Hely\xe2\x80\x99s sandwichboards,\r\nshuffles past them in carpet slippers, his dull beard thrust out,\r\nmuttering to right and left. Little Alf Bergan, cloaked in the pall of\r\nthe ace of spades, dogs him to left and right, doubled in laughter.)\r\n\r\nALF BERGAN: (Points jeering at the sandwichboards.) U. p: Up.\r\n\r\nMRS BREEN: (To Bloom.) High jinks below stairs. (She gives him the glad\r\neye.) Why didn\xe2\x80\x99t you kiss the spot to make it well? You wanted to.\r\n\r\nBLOOM: (Shocked.) Molly\xe2\x80\x99s best friend! Could you?\r\n\r\nMRS BREEN: (Her pulpy tongue between her lips, offers a pigeon kiss.)\r\nHnhn. The answer is a lemon. Have you a little present for me there?\r\n\r\nBLOOM: (Offhandedly.) Kosher. A snack for supper. The home without\r\npotted meat is incomplete. I was at Leah, Mrs Bandmann Palmer. Trenchant\r\nexponent of Shakespeare. Unfortunately threw away the programme.\r\nRattling good place round there for pigs\xe2\x80\x99 feet. Feel.\r\n\r\n(Richie Goulding, three ladies\xe2\x80\x99 hats pinned on his head, appears\r\nweighted to one side by the black legal bag of Collis and Ward on which\r\na skull and crossbones are painted in white limewash. He opens it\r\nand shows it full of polonies, kippered herrings, Findon haddies and\r\ntightpacked pills.)\r\n\r\nRICHIE: Best value in Dub.\r\n\r\n(Bald Pat, bothered beetle, stands on the curbstone, folding his napkin,\r\nwaiting to wait.)\r\n\r\nPAT: (Advances with a tilted dish of spillspilling gravy.) Steak and\r\nkidney. Bottle of lager. Hee hee hee. Wait till I wait.\r\n\r\nRICHIE: Goodgod. Inev erate inall...\r\n\r\n(With hanging head he marches doggedly forward. The navvy, lurching by,\r\ngores him with his flaming pronghorn.)\r\n\r\nRICHIE: (With a cry of pain, his hand to his back.) Ah! Bright\xe2\x80\x99s!\r\nLights!\r\n\r\nBLOOM: (Points to the navvy.) A spy. Don\xe2\x80\x99t attract attention. I hate\r\nstupid crowds. I am not on pleasure bent. I am in a grave predicament.\r\n\r\nMRS BREEN: Humbugging and deluthering as per usual with your cock and\r\nbull story.\r\n\r\nBLOOM: I want to tell you a little secret about how I came to be here.\r\nBut you must never tell. Not even Molly. I have a most particular\r\nreason.\r\n\r\nMRS BREEN: (All agog.) O, not for worlds.\r\n\r\nBLOOM: Let\xe2\x80\x99s walk on. Shall us?\r\n\r\nMRS BREEN: Let\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\n(The bawd makes an unheeded sign. Bloom walks on with Mrs Breen. The\r\nterrier follows, whining piteously, wagging his tail.)\r\n\r\nTHE BAWD: Jewman\xe2\x80\x99s melt!\r\n\r\nBLOOM: (In an oatmeal sporting suit, a sprig of woodbine in the lapel,\r\ntony buff shirt, shepherd\xe2\x80\x99s plaid Saint Andrew\xe2\x80\x99s cross scarftie, white\r\nspats, fawn dustcoat on his arm, tawny red brogues, fieldglasses in\r\nbandolier and a grey billycock hat.) Do you remember a long long time,\r\nyears and years ago, just after Milly, Marionette we called her, was\r\nweaned when we all went together to Fairyhouse races, was it?\r\n\r\nMRS BREEN: (In smart Saxe tailormade, white velours hat and spider\r\nveil.) Leopardstown.\r\n\r\nBLOOM: I mean, Leopardstown. And Molly won seven shillings on a three\r\nyear old named Nevertell and coming home along by Foxrock in that old\r\nfiveseater shanderadan of a waggonette you were in your heyday then and\r\nyou had on that new hat of white velours with a surround of molefur that\r\nMrs Hayes advised you to buy because it was marked down to nineteen and\r\neleven, a bit of wire and an old rag of velveteen, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll lay you what\r\nyou like she did it on purpose...\r\n\r\nMRS BREEN: She did, of course, the cat! Don\xe2\x80\x99t tell me! Nice adviser!\r\n\r\nBLOOM: Because it didn\xe2\x80\x99t suit you one quarter as well as the other ducky\r\nlittle tammy toque with the bird of paradise wing in it that I admired\r\non you and you honestly looked just too fetching in it though it was a\r\npity to kill it, you cruel naughty creature, little mite of a thing with\r\na heart the size of a fullstop.\r\n\r\nMRS BREEN: (Squeezes his arm, simpers.) Naughty cruel I was!\r\n\r\nBLOOM: (Low, secretly, ever more rapidly.) And Molly was eating a\r\nsandwich of spiced beef out of Mrs Joe Gallaher\xe2\x80\x99s lunch basket. Frankly,\r\nthough she had her advisers or admirers, I never cared much for her\r\nstyle. She was...\r\n\r\nMRS BREEN: Too...\r\n\r\nBLOOM: Yes. And Molly was laughing because Rogers and Maggot O\xe2\x80\x99Reilly\r\nwere mimicking a cock as we passed a farmhouse and Marcus Tertius Moses,\r\nthe tea merchant, drove past us in a gig with his daughter, Dancer Moses\r\nwas her name, and the poodle in her lap bridled up and you asked me if I\r\never heard or read or knew or came across...\r\n\r\nMRS BREEN: (Eagerly.) Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.\r\n\r\n(She fades from his side. Followed by the whining dog he walks on\r\ntowards hellsgates. In an archway a standing woman, bent forward, her\r\nfeet apart, pisses cowily. Outside a shuttered pub a bunch of loiterers\r\nlisten to a tale which their brokensnouted gaffer rasps out with raucous\r\nhumour. An armless pair of them flop wrestling, growling, in maimed\r\nsodden playfight.)\r\n\r\nTHE GAFFER: (Crouches, his voice twisted in his snout.) And when Cairns\r\ncame down from the scaffolding in Beaver street what was he after doing\r\nit into only into the bucket of porter that was there waiting on the\r\nshavings for Derwan\xe2\x80\x99s plasterers.\r\n\r\nTHE LOITERERS: (Guffaw with cleft palates.) O jays!\r\n\r\n(Their paintspeckled hats wag. Spattered with size and lime of their\r\nlodges they frisk limblessly about him.)\r\n\r\nBLOOM: Coincidence too. They think it funny. Anything but that. Broad\r\ndaylight. Trying to walk. Lucky no woman.\r\n\r\nTHE LOITERERS: Jays, that\xe2\x80\x99s a good one. Glauber salts. O jays, into the\r\nmen\xe2\x80\x99s porter.\r\n\r\n(Bloom passes. Cheap whores, singly, coupled, shawled, dishevelled, call\r\nfrom lanes, doors, corners.)\r\n\r\nTHE WHORES:\r\n\r\n     Are you going far, queer fellow?\r\n     How\xe2\x80\x99s your middle leg?\r\n     Got a match on you?\r\n     Eh, come here till I stiffen it for you.\r\n\r\n(He plodges through their sump towards the lighted street beyond. From a\r\nbulge of window curtains a gramophone rears a battered brazen trunk. In\r\nthe shadow a shebeenkeeper haggles with the navvy and the two redcoats.)\r\n\r\nTHE NAVVY: (Belching.) Where\xe2\x80\x99s the bloody house?\r\n\r\nTHE SHEBEENKEEPER: Purdon street. Shilling a bottle of stout.\r\nRespectable woman.\r\n\r\nTHE NAVVY: (Gripping the two redcoats, staggers forward with them.) Come\r\non, you British army!\r\n\r\nPRIVATE CARR: (Behind his back.) He aint half balmy.\r\n\r\nPRIVATE COMPTON: (Laughs.) What ho!\r\n\r\nPRIVATE CARR: (To the navvy.) Portobello barracks canteen. You ask for\r\nCarr. Just Carr.\r\n\r\nTHE NAVVY: (Shouts.)\r\n\r\n      We are the boys. Of Wexford.\r\n\r\nPRIVATE COMPTON: Say! What price the sergeantmajor?\r\n\r\nPRIVATE CARR: Bennett? He\xe2\x80\x99s my pal. I love old Bennett.\r\n\r\nTHE NAVVY: (Shouts.)\r\n\r\n     The galling chain.\r\n     And free our native land.\r\n\r\n(He staggers forward, dragging them with him. Bloom stops, at fault. The\r\ndog approaches, his tongue outlolling, panting.)\r\n\r\nBLOOM: Wildgoose chase this. Disorderly houses. Lord knows where they\r\nare gone. Drunks cover distance double quick. Nice mixup. Scene at\r\nWestland row. Then jump in first class with third ticket. Then too far.\r\nTrain with engine behind. Might have taken me to Malahide or a siding\r\nfor the night or collision. Second drink does it. Once is a dose. What\r\nam I following him for? Still, he\xe2\x80\x99s the best of that lot. If I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nheard about Mrs Beaufoy Purefoy I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have gone and wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have\r\nmet. Kismet. He\xe2\x80\x99ll lose that cash. Relieving office here. Good biz for\r\ncheapjacks, organs. What do ye lack? Soon got, soon gone. Might have\r\nlost my life too with that mangongwheeltracktrolleyglarejuggernaut only\r\nfor presence of mind. Can\xe2\x80\x99t always save you, though. If I had passed\r\nTruelock\xe2\x80\x99s window that day two minutes later would have been shot.\r\nAbsence of body. Still if bullet only went through my coat get damages\r\nfor shock, five hundred pounds. What was he? Kildare street club toff.\r\nGod help his gamekeeper.\r\n\r\n(He gazes ahead, reading on the wall a scrawled chalk legend Wet Dream\r\nand a phallic design.) Odd! Molly drawing on the frosted carriagepane\r\nat Kingstown. What\xe2\x80\x99s that like? (Gaudy dollwomen loll in the lighted\r\ndoorways, in window embrasures, smoking birdseye cigarettes. The\r\nodour of the sicksweet weed floats towards him in slow round ovalling\r\nwreaths.)\r\n\r\nTHE WREATHS: Sweet are the sweets. Sweets of sin.\r\n\r\nBLOOM: My spine\xe2\x80\x99s a bit limp. Go or turn? And this food? Eat it and get\r\nall pigsticky. Absurd I am. Waste of money. One and eightpence too much.\r\n(The retriever drives a cold snivelling muzzle against his hand, wagging\r\nhis tail.) Strange how they take to me. Even that brute today. Better\r\nspeak to him first. Like women they like rencontres. Stinks like a\r\npolecat. Chacun son go\xc3\xbbt. He might be mad. Dogdays. Uncertain in his\r\nmovements. Good fellow! Fido! Good fellow! Garryowen! (The wolfdog\r\nsprawls on his back, wriggling obscenely with begging paws, his long\r\nblack tongue lolling out.) Influence of his surroundings. Give and have\r\ndone with it. Provided nobody. (Calling encouraging words he shambles\r\nback with a furtive poacher\xe2\x80\x99s tread, dogged by the setter into a dark\r\nstalestunk corner. He unrolls one parcel and goes to dump the crubeen\r\nsoftly but holds back and feels the trotter.) Sizeable for threepence.\r\nBut then I have it in my left hand. Calls for more effort. Why? Smaller\r\nfrom want of use. O, let it slide. Two and six.\r\n\r\n(With regret he lets the unrolled crubeen and trotter slide. The\r\nmastiff mauls the bundle clumsily and gluts himself with growling greed,\r\ncrunching the bones. Two raincaped watch approach, silent, vigilant.\r\nThey murmur together.)\r\n\r\nTHE WATCH: Bloom. Of Bloom. For Bloom. Bloom.\r\n\r\n(Each lays hand on Bloom\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder.)\r\n\r\nFIRST WATCH: Caught in the act. Commit no nuisance.\r\n\r\nBLOOM: (Stammers.) I am doing good to others.\r\n\r\n(A covey of gulls, storm petrels, rises hungrily from Liffey slime with\r\nBanbury cakes in their beaks.)\r\n\r\nTHE GULLS: Kaw kave kankury kake.\r\n\r\nBLOOM: The friend of man. Trained by kindness.\r\n\r\n(He points. Bob Doran, toppling from a high barstool, sways over the\r\nmunching spaniel.)\r\n\r\nBOB DORAN: Towser. Give us the paw. Give the paw.\r\n\r\n(The bulldog growls, his scruff standing, a gobbet of pig\xe2\x80\x99s knuckle\r\nbetween his molars through which rabid scumspittle dribbles. Bob Doran\r\nfalls silently into an area.)\r\n\r\nSECOND WATCH: Prevention of cruelty to animals.\r\n\r\nBLOOM: (Enthusiastically.) A noble work! I scolded that tramdriver on\r\nHarold\xe2\x80\x99s cross bridge for illusing the poor horse with his harness scab.\r\nBad French I got for my pains. Of course it was frosty and the last\r\ntram. All tales of circus life are highly demoralising.\r\n\r\n(Signor Maffei, passionpale, in liontamer\xe2\x80\x99s costume with diamond studs\r\nin his shirtfront, steps forward, holding a circus paperhoop, a curling\r\ncarriagewhip and a revolver with which he covers the gorging boarhound.)\r\n\r\nSIGNOR MAFFEI: (With a sinister smile.) Ladies and gentlemen, my\r\neducated greyhound. It was I broke in the bucking broncho Ajax with my\r\npatent spiked saddle for carnivores. Lash under the belly with a knotted\r\nthong. Block tackle and a strangling pulley will bring your lion\r\nto heel, no matter how fractious, even Leo ferox there, the Libyan\r\nmaneater. A redhot crowbar and some liniment rubbing on the burning part\r\nproduced Fritz of Amsterdam, the thinking hyena. (He glares.) I possess\r\nthe Indian sign. The glint of my eye does it with these breastsparklers.\r\n(With a bewitching smile.) I now introduce Mademoiselle Ruby, the pride\r\nof the ring.\r\n\r\nFIRST WATCH: Come. Name and address.\r\n\r\nBLOOM: I have forgotten for the moment. Ah, yes! (He takes off his high\r\ngrade hat, saluting.) Dr Bloom, Leopold, dental surgeon. You have heard\r\nof von Blum Pasha. Umpteen millions. Donnerwetter! Owns half Austria.\r\nEgypt. Cousin.\r\n\r\nFIRST WATCH: Proof.\r\n\r\n(A card falls from inside the leather headband of Bloom\xe2\x80\x99s hat.)\r\n\r\nBLOOM: (In red fez, cadi\xe2\x80\x99s dress coat with broad green sash, wearing\r\na false badge of the Legion of Honour, picks up the card hastily and\r\noffers it.) Allow me. My club is the Junior Army and Navy. Solicitors:\r\nMessrs John Henry Menton, 27 Bachelor\xe2\x80\x99s Walk.\r\n\r\nFIRST WATCH: (Reads.) Henry Flower. No fixed abode. Unlawfully watching\r\nand besetting.\r\n\r\nSECOND WATCH: An alibi. You are cautioned.\r\n\r\nBLOOM: (Produces from his heartpocket a crumpled yellow flower.) This is\r\nthe flower in question. It was given me by a man I don\xe2\x80\x99t know his name.\r\n(Plausibly.) You know that old joke, rose of Castile. Bloom. The change\r\nof name. Virag. (He murmurs privately and confidentially.) We are\r\nengaged you see, sergeant. Lady in the case. Love entanglement. (He\r\nshoulders the second watch gently.) Dash it all. It\xe2\x80\x99s a way we gallants\r\nhave in the navy. Uniform that does it. (He turns gravely to the first\r\nwatch.) Still, of course, you do get your Waterloo sometimes. Drop in\r\nsome evening and have a glass of old Burgundy. (To the second watch\r\ngaily.) I\xe2\x80\x99ll introduce you, inspector. She\xe2\x80\x99s game. Do it in the shake of\r\na lamb\xe2\x80\x99s tail.\r\n\r\n(A dark mercurialised face appears, leading a veiled figure.)\r\n\r\nTHE DARK MERCURY: The Castle is looking for him. He was drummed out of\r\nthe army.\r\n\r\nMARTHA: (Thickveiled, a crimson halter round her neck, a copy of the\r\nIrish Times in her hand, in tone of reproach, pointing.) Henry! Leopold!\r\nLionel, thou lost one! Clear my name.\r\n\r\nFIRST WATCH: (Sternly.) Come to the station.\r\n\r\nBLOOM: (Scared, hats himself, steps back, then, plucking at his heart\r\nand lifting his right forearm on the square, he gives the sign and\r\ndueguard of fellowcraft.) No, no, worshipful master, light of love.\r\nMistaken identity. The Lyons mail. Lesurques and Dubosc. You remember\r\nthe Childs fratricide case. We medical men. By striking him dead with\r\na hatchet. I am wrongfully accused. Better one guilty escape than\r\nninetynine wrongfully condemned.\r\n\r\nMARTHA: (Sobbing behind her veil.) Breach of promise. My real name\r\nis Peggy Griffin. He wrote to me that he was miserable. I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell my\r\nbrother, the Bective rugger fullback, on you, heartless flirt.\r\n\r\nBLOOM: (Behind his hand.) She\xe2\x80\x99s drunk. The woman is inebriated. (He\r\nmurmurs vaguely the pass of Ephraim.) Shitbroleeth.\r\n\r\nSECOND WATCH: (Tears in his eyes, to Bloom.) You ought to be thoroughly\r\nwell ashamed of yourself.\r\n\r\nBLOOM: Gentlemen of the jury, let me explain. A pure mare\xe2\x80\x99s nest. I am\r\na man misunderstood. I am being made a scapegoat of. I am a respectable\r\nmarried man, without a stain on my character. I live in Eccles street.\r\nMy wife, I am the daughter of a most distinguished commander, a gallant\r\nupstanding gentleman, what do you call him, Majorgeneral Brian Tweedy,\r\none of Britain\xe2\x80\x99s fighting men who helped to win our battles. Got his\r\nmajority for the heroic defence of Rorke\xe2\x80\x99s Drift.\r\n\r\nFIRST WATCH: Regiment.\r\n\r\nBLOOM: (Turns to the gallery.) The royal Dublins, boys, the salt of the\r\nearth, known the world over. I think I see some old comrades in arms\r\nup there among you. The R. D. F., with our own Metropolitan police,\r\nguardians of our homes, the pluckiest lads and the finest body of men,\r\nas physique, in the service of our sovereign.\r\n\r\nA VOICE: Turncoat! Up the Boers! Who booed Joe Chamberlain?\r\n\r\nBLOOM: (His hand on the shoulder of the first watch.) My old dad too was\r\na J. P. I\xe2\x80\x99m as staunch a Britisher as you are, sir. I fought with the\r\ncolours for king and country in the absentminded war under general\r\nGough in the park and was disabled at Spion Kop and Bloemfontein,\r\nwas mentioned in dispatches. I did all a white man could. (With quiet\r\nfeeling.) Jim Bludso. Hold her nozzle again the bank.\r\n\r\nFIRST WATCH: Profession or trade.\r\n\r\nBLOOM: Well, I follow a literary occupation, author-journalist. In fact\r\nwe are just bringing out a collection of prize stories of which I am the\r\ninventor, something that is an entirely new departure. I am connected\r\nwith the British and Irish press. If you ring up...\r\n\r\n(Myles Crawford strides out jerkily, a quill between his teeth. His\r\nscarlet beak blazes within the aureole of his straw hat. He dangles\r\na hank of Spanish onions in one hand and holds with the other hand a\r\ntelephone receiver nozzle to his ear.)\r\n\r\nMYLES CRAWFORD: (His cock\xe2\x80\x99s wattles wagging.) Hello, seventyseven\r\neightfour. Hello. Freeman\xe2\x80\x99s Urinal and Weekly Arsewipe here. Paralyse\r\nEurope. You which? Bluebags? Who writes? Is it Bloom?\r\n\r\n(Mr Philip Beaufoy, palefaced, stands in the witnessbox, in accurate\r\nmorning dress, outbreast pocket with peak of handkerchief showing,\r\ncreased lavender trousers and patent boots. He carries a large portfolio\r\nlabelled Matcham\xe2\x80\x99s Masterstrokes.)\r\n\r\nBEAUFOY: (Drawls.) No, you aren\xe2\x80\x99t. Not by a long shot if I know it.\r\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t see it, that\xe2\x80\x99s all. No born gentleman, no-one with the most\r\nrudimentary promptings of a gentleman would stoop to such particularly\r\nloathsome conduct. One of those, my lord. A plagiarist. A soapy sneak\r\nmasquerading as a literateur. It\xe2\x80\x99s perfectly obvious that with the most\r\ninherent baseness he has cribbed some of my bestselling copy, really\r\ngorgeous stuff, a perfect gem, the love passages in which are beneath\r\nsuspicion. The Beaufoy books of love and great possessions, with which\r\nyour lordship is doubtless familiar, are a household word throughout the\r\nkingdom.\r\n\r\nBLOOM: (Murmurs with hangdog meekness glum.) That bit about the laughing\r\nwitch hand in hand I take exception to, if I may...\r\n\r\nBEAUFOY: (His lip upcurled, smiles superciliously on the court.) You\r\nfunny ass, you! You\xe2\x80\x99re too beastly awfully weird for words! I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nthink you need over excessively disincommodate yourself in that regard.\r\nMy literary agent Mr J. B. Pinker is in attendance. I presume, my\r\nlord, we shall receive the usual witnesses\xe2\x80\x99 fees, shan\xe2\x80\x99t we? We are\r\nconsiderably out of pocket over this bally pressman johnny, this jackdaw\r\nof Rheims, who has not even been to a university.\r\n\r\nBLOOM: (Indistinctly.) University of life. Bad art.\r\n\r\nBEAUFOY: (Shouts.) It\xe2\x80\x99s a damnably foul lie, showing the moral\r\nrottenness of the man! (He extends his portfolio.) We have here damning\r\nevidence, the corpus delicti, my lord, a specimen of my maturer work\r\ndisfigured by the hallmark of the beast.\r\n\r\nA VOICE FROM THE GALLERY:\r\n\r\n      Moses, Moses, king of the jews,\r\n      Wiped his arse in the Daily News.\r\n\r\nBLOOM: (Bravely.) Overdrawn.\r\n\r\nBEAUFOY: You low cad! You ought to be ducked in the horsepond, you\r\nrotter! (To the court.) Why, look at the man\xe2\x80\x99s private life! Leading\r\na quadruple existence! Street angel and house devil. Not fit to be\r\nmentioned in mixed society! The archconspirator of the age!\r\n\r\nBLOOM: (To the court.) And he, a bachelor, how...\r\n\r\nFIRST WATCH: The King versus Bloom. Call the woman Driscoll.\r\n\r\nTHE CRIER: Mary Driscoll, scullerymaid!\r\n\r\n(Mary Driscoll, a slipshod servant girl, approaches. She has a bucket on\r\nthe crook of her arm and a scouringbrush in her hand.)\r\n\r\nSECOND WATCH: Another! Are you of the unfortunate class?\r\n\r\nMARY DRISCOLL: (Indignantly.) I\xe2\x80\x99m not a bad one. I bear a respectable\r\ncharacter and was four months in my last place. I was in a situation,\r\nsix pounds a year and my chances with Fridays out and I had to leave\r\nowing to his carryings on.\r\n\r\nFIRST WATCH: What do you tax him with?\r\n\r\nMARY DRISCOLL: He made a certain suggestion but I thought more of myself\r\nas poor as I am.\r\n\r\nBLOOM: (In housejacket of ripplecloth, flannel trousers, heelless\r\nslippers, unshaven, his hair rumpled: softly.) I treated you white.\r\nI gave you mementos, smart emerald garters far above your station.\r\nIncautiously I took your part when you were accused of pilfering.\r\nThere\xe2\x80\x99s a medium in all things. Play cricket.\r\n\r\nMARY DRISCOLL: (Excitedly.) As God is looking down on me this night if\r\never I laid a hand to them oylsters!\r\n\r\nFIRST WATCH: The offence complained of? Did something happen?\r\n\r\nMARY DRISCOLL: He surprised me in the rere of the premises, Your honour,\r\nwhen the missus was out shopping one morning with a request for a safety\r\npin. He held me and I was discoloured in four places as a result. And he\r\ninterfered twict with my clothing.\r\n\r\nBLOOM: She counterassaulted.\r\n\r\nMARY DRISCOLL: (Scornfully.) I had more respect for the scouringbrush,\r\nso I had. I remonstrated with him, Your lord, and he remarked: keep it\r\nquiet.\r\n\r\n(General laughter.)\r\n\r\nGEORGE FOTTRELL: (Clerk of the crown and peace, resonantly.) Order in\r\ncourt! The accused will now make a bogus statement.\r\n\r\n(Bloom, pleading not guilty and holding a fullblown waterlily, begins a\r\nlong unintelligible speech. They would hear what counsel had to say in\r\nhis stirring address to the grand jury. He was down and out but, though\r\nbranded as a black sheep, if he might say so, he meant to reform, to\r\nretrieve the memory of the past in a purely sisterly way and return to\r\nnature as a purely domestic animal. A sevenmonths\xe2\x80\x99 child, he had been\r\ncarefully brought up and nurtured by an aged bedridden parent. There\r\nmight have been lapses of an erring father but he wanted to turn over\r\na new leaf and now, when at long last in sight of the whipping post,\r\nto lead a homely life in the evening of his days, permeated by the\r\naffectionate surroundings of the heaving bosom of the family. An\r\nacclimatised Britisher, he had seen that summer eve from the footplate\r\nof an engine cab of the Loop line railway company while the rain\r\nrefrained from falling glimpses, as it were, through the windows of\r\nloveful households in Dublin city and urban district of scenes truly\r\nrural of happiness of the better land with Dockrell\xe2\x80\x99s wallpaper at one\r\nand ninepence a dozen, innocent Britishborn bairns lisping prayers to\r\nthe Sacred Infant, youthful scholars grappling with their pensums or\r\nmodel young ladies playing on the pianoforte or anon all with fervour\r\nreciting the family rosary round the crackling Yulelog while in the\r\nboreens and green lanes the colleens with their swains strolled what\r\ntimes the strains of the organtoned melodeon Britannia metalbound with\r\nfour acting stops and twelvefold bellows, a sacrifice, greatest bargain\r\never...\r\n\r\n(Renewed laughter. He mumbles incoherently. Reporters complain that they\r\ncannot hear.)\r\n\r\nLONGHAND AND SHORTHAND: (Without looking up from their notebooks.)\r\nLoosen his boots.\r\n\r\nPROFESSOR MACHUGH: (From the presstable, coughs and calls.) Cough it up,\r\nman. Get it out in bits.\r\n\r\n(The crossexamination proceeds re Bloom and the bucket. A large bucket.\r\nBloom himself. Bowel trouble. In Beaver street. Gripe, yes. Quite bad.\r\nA plasterer\xe2\x80\x99s bucket. By walking stifflegged. Suffered untold misery.\r\nDeadly agony. About noon. Love or burgundy. Yes, some spinach. Crucial\r\nmoment. He did not look in the bucket. Nobody. Rather a mess. Not\r\ncompletely. A Titbits back number.)\r\n\r\n(Uproar and catcalls. Bloom in a torn frockcoat stained with whitewash,\r\ndinged silk hat sideways on his head, a strip of stickingplaster across\r\nhis nose, talks inaudibly.)\r\n\r\nJ. J. O\xe2\x80\x99MOLLOY: (In barrister\xe2\x80\x99s grey wig and stuffgown, speaking with\r\na voice of pained protest.) This is no place for indecent levity at\r\nthe expense of an erring mortal disguised in liquor. We are not in a\r\nbeargarden nor at an Oxford rag nor is this a travesty of justice. My\r\nclient is an infant, a poor foreign immigrant who started scratch as\r\na stowaway and is now trying to turn an honest penny. The trumped up\r\nmisdemeanour was due to a momentary aberration of heredity, brought on\r\nby hallucination, such familiarities as the alleged guilty occurrence\r\nbeing quite permitted in my client\xe2\x80\x99s native place, the land of the\r\nPharaoh. Prima facie, I put it to you that there was no attempt at\r\ncarnally knowing. Intimacy did not occur and the offence complained of\r\nby Driscoll, that her virtue was solicited, was not repeated. I would\r\ndeal in especial with atavism. There have been cases of shipwreck and\r\nsomnambulism in my client\xe2\x80\x99s family. If the accused could speak he could\r\na tale unfold\xe2\x80\x94one of the strangest that have ever been narrated between\r\nthe covers of a book. He himself, my lord, is a physical wreck from\r\ncobbler\xe2\x80\x99s weak chest. His submission is that he is of Mongolian\r\nextraction and irresponsible for his actions. Not all there, in fact.\r\n\r\nBLOOM: (Barefoot, pigeonbreasted, in lascar\xe2\x80\x99s vest and trousers,\r\napologetic toes turned in, opens his tiny mole\xe2\x80\x99s eyes and looks about\r\nhim dazedly, passing a slow hand across his forehead. Then he hitches\r\nhis belt sailor fashion and with a shrug of oriental obeisance salutes\r\nthe court, pointing one thumb heavenward.) Him makee velly muchee fine\r\nnight. (He begins to lilt simply.)\r\n\r\n     Li li poo lil chile\r\n     Blingee pigfoot evly night\r\n     Payee two shilly...\r\n\r\n(He is howled down.)\r\n\r\nJ. J. O\xe2\x80\x99MOLLOY: (Hotly to the populace.) This is a lonehand fight. By\r\nHades, I will not have any client of mine gagged and badgered in this\r\nfashion by a pack of curs and laughing hyenas. The Mosaic code has\r\nsuperseded the law of the jungle. I say it and I say it emphatically,\r\nwithout wishing for one moment to defeat the ends of justice, accused\r\nwas not accessory before the act and prosecutrix has not been tampered\r\nwith. The young person was treated by defendant as if she were his very\r\nown daughter. (Bloom takes J. J. O\xe2\x80\x99Molloy\xe2\x80\x99s hand and raises it to his\r\nlips.) I shall call rebutting evidence to prove up to the hilt that the\r\nhidden hand is again at its old game. When in doubt persecute Bloom. My\r\nclient, an innately bashful man, would be the last man in the world to\r\ndo anything ungentlemanly which injured modesty could object to or\r\ncast a stone at a girl who took the wrong turning when some dastard,\r\nresponsible for her condition, had worked his own sweet will on her. He\r\nwants to go straight. I regard him as the whitest man I know. He is down\r\non his luck at present owing to the mortgaging of his extensive property\r\nat Agendath Netaim in faraway Asia Minor, slides of which will now be\r\nshown. (To Bloom.) I suggest that you will do the handsome thing.\r\n\r\nBLOOM: A penny in the pound.\r\n\r\n(The image of the lake of Kinnereth with blurred cattle cropping in\r\nsilver haze is projected on the wall. Moses Dlugacz, ferreteyed albino,\r\nin blue dungarees, stands up in the gallery, holding in each hand an\r\norange citron and a pork kidney.)\r\n\r\nDLUGACZ: (Hoarsely.) Bleibtreustrasse, Berlin, W. 13.\r\n\r\n(J. J. O\xe2\x80\x99Molloy steps on to a low plinth and holds the lapel of his coat\r\nwith solemnity. His face lengthens, grows pale and bearded, with sunken\r\neyes, the blotches of phthisis and hectic cheekbones of John F. Taylor.\r\nHe applies his handkerchief to his mouth and scrutinises the galloping\r\ntide of rosepink blood.)\r\n\r\nJ. J. O\xe2\x80\x99MOLLOY: (Almost voicelessly.) Excuse me. I am suffering from a\r\nsevere chill, have recently come from a sickbed. A few wellchosen words.\r\n(He assumes the avine head, foxy moustache and proboscidal eloquence of\r\nSeymour Bushe.) When the angel\xe2\x80\x99s book comes to be opened if aught\r\nthat the pensive bosom has inaugurated of soultransfigured and of\r\nsoultransfiguring deserves to live I say accord the prisoner at the bar\r\nthe sacred benefit of the doubt.\r\n\r\n(A paper with something written on it is handed into court.)\r\n\r\nBLOOM: (In court dress.) Can give best references. Messrs Callan,\r\nColeman. Mr Wisdom Hely J. P. My old chief Joe Cuffe. Mr V. B. Dillon,\r\nex lord mayor of Dublin. I have moved in the charmed circle of the\r\nhighest... Queens of Dublin society. (Carelessly.) I was just chatting\r\nthis afternoon at the viceregal lodge to my old pals, sir Robert and\r\nlady Ball, astronomer royal, at the levee. Sir Bob, I said...\r\n\r\nMRS YELVERTON BARRY: (In lowcorsaged opal balldress and elbowlength\r\nivory gloves, wearing a sabletrimmed brickquilted dolman, a comb of\r\nbrilliants and panache of osprey in her hair.) Arrest him, constable. He\r\nwrote me an anonymous letter in prentice backhand when my husband was\r\nin the North Riding of Tipperary on the Munster circuit, signed James\r\nLovebirch. He said that he had seen from the gods my peerless globes\r\nas I sat in a box of the Theatre Royal at a command performance of La\r\nCigale. I deeply inflamed him, he said. He made improper overtures to me\r\nto misconduct myself at half past four p.m. on the following Thursday,\r\nDunsink time. He offered to send me through the post a work of fiction\r\nby Monsieur Paul de Kock, entitled The Girl with the Three Pairs of\r\nStays.\r\n\r\nMRS BELLINGHAM: (In cap and seal coney mantle, wrapped up to the\r\nnose, steps out of her brougham and scans through tortoiseshell\r\nquizzing-glasses which she takes from inside her huge opossum muff.)\r\nAlso to me. Yes, I believe it is the same objectionable person. Because\r\nhe closed my carriage door outside sir Thornley Stoker\xe2\x80\x99s one sleety day\r\nduring the cold snap of February ninetythree when even the grid of the\r\nwastepipe and the ballstop in my bath cistern were frozen. Subsequently\r\nhe enclosed a bloom of edelweiss culled on the heights, as he said,\r\nin my honour. I had it examined by a botanical expert and elicited\r\nthe information that it was a blossom of the homegrown potato plant\r\npurloined from a forcingcase of the model farm.\r\n\r\nMRS YELVERTON BARRY: Shame on him!\r\n\r\n(A crowd of sluts and ragamuffins surges forward.)\r\n\r\nTHE SLUTS AND RAGAMUFFINS: (Screaming.) Stop thief! Hurrah there,\r\nBluebeard! Three cheers for Ikey Mo!\r\n\r\nSECOND WATCH: (Produces handcuffs.) Here are the darbies.\r\n\r\nMRS BELLINGHAM: He addressed me in several handwritings with fulsome\r\ncompliments as a Venus in furs and alleged profound pity for my\r\nfrostbound coachman Palmer while in the same breath he expressed himself\r\nas envious of his earflaps and fleecy sheepskins and of his fortunate\r\nproximity to my person, when standing behind my chair wearing my livery\r\nand the armorial bearings of the Bellingham escutcheon garnished sable,\r\na buck\xe2\x80\x99s head couped or. He lauded almost extravagantly my nether\r\nextremities, my swelling calves in silk hose drawn up to the limit, and\r\neulogised glowingly my other hidden treasures in priceless lace which,\r\nhe said, he could conjure up. He urged me (Stating that he felt it\r\nhis mission in life to urge me.) to defile the marriage bed, to commit\r\nadultery at the earliest possible opportunity.\r\n\r\nTHE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS: (In amazon costume, hard hat,\r\njackboots cockspurred, vermilion waistcoat, fawn musketeer gauntlets\r\nwith braided drums, long train held up and hunting crop with which she\r\nstrikes her welt constantly.) Also me. Because he saw me on the polo\r\nground of the Phoenix park at the match All Ireland versus the Rest of\r\nIreland. My eyes, I know, shone divinely as I watched Captain Slogger\r\nDennehy of the Inniskillings win the final chukkar on his darling cob\r\nCentaur. This plebeian Don Juan observed me from behind a hackney car\r\nand sent me in double envelopes an obscene photograph, such as are sold\r\nafter dark on Paris boulevards, insulting to any lady. I have it still.\r\nIt represents a partially nude se\xc3\xb1orita, frail and lovely (his wife, as\r\nhe solemnly assured me, taken by him from nature), practising illicit\r\nintercourse with a muscular torero, evidently a blackguard. He urged me\r\nto do likewise, to misbehave, to sin with officers of the garrison. He\r\nimplored me to soil his letter in an unspeakable manner, to chastise\r\nhim as he richly deserves, to bestride and ride him, to give him a most\r\nvicious horsewhipping.\r\n\r\nMRS BELLINGHAM: Me too.\r\n\r\nMRS YELVERTON BARRY: Me too.\r\n\r\n(Several highly respectable Dublin ladies hold up improper letters\r\nreceived from Bloom.)\r\n\r\nTHE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS: (Stamps her jingling spurs in a\r\nsudden paroxysm of fury.) I will, by the God above me. I\xe2\x80\x99ll scourge the\r\npigeonlivered cur as long as I can stand over him. I\xe2\x80\x99ll flay him alive.\r\n\r\nBLOOM: (His eyes closing, quails expectantly.) Here? (He squirms.)\r\nAgain! (He pants cringing.) I love the danger.\r\n\r\nTHE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS: Very much so! I\xe2\x80\x99ll make it hot for\r\nyou. I\xe2\x80\x99ll make you dance Jack Latten for that.\r\n\r\nMRS BELLINGHAM: Tan his breech well, the upstart! Write the stars and\r\nstripes on it!\r\n\r\nMRS YELVERTON BARRY: Disgraceful! There\xe2\x80\x99s no excuse for him! A married\r\nman!\r\n\r\nBLOOM: All these people. I meant only the spanking idea. A warm tingling\r\nglow without effusion. Refined birching to stimulate the circulation.\r\n\r\nTHE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS: (Laughs derisively.) O, did you, my\r\nfine fellow? Well, by the living God, you\xe2\x80\x99ll get the surprise of your\r\nlife now, believe me, the most unmerciful hiding a man ever bargained\r\nfor. You have lashed the dormant tigress in my nature into fury.\r\n\r\nMRS BELLINGHAM: (Shakes her muff and quizzing-glasses vindictively.)\r\nMake him smart, Hanna dear. Give him ginger. Thrash the mongrel within\r\nan inch of his life. The cat-o\xe2\x80\x99-nine-tails. Geld him. Vivisect him.\r\n\r\nBLOOM: (Shuddering, shrinking, joins his hands: with hangdog mien.) O\r\ncold! O shivery! It was your ambrosial beauty. Forget, forgive. Kismet.\r\nLet me off this once. (He offers the other cheek.)\r\n\r\nMRS YELVERTON BARRY: (Severely.) Don\xe2\x80\x99t do so on any account, Mrs\r\nTalboys! He should be soundly trounced!\r\n\r\nTHE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS: (Unbuttoning her gauntlet violently.)\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll do no such thing. Pigdog and always was ever since he was pupped!\r\nTo dare address me! I\xe2\x80\x99ll flog him black and blue in the public streets.\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll dig my spurs in him up to the rowel. He is a wellknown cuckold.\r\n(She swishes her huntingcrop savagely in the air.) Take down his\r\ntrousers without loss of time. Come here, sir! Quick! Ready?\r\n\r\nBLOOM: (Trembling, beginning to obey.) The weather has been so warm.\r\n\r\n(Davy Stephens, ringletted, passes with a bevy of barefoot newsboys.)\r\n\r\nDAVY STEPHENS: Messenger of the Sacred Heart and Evening Telegraph with\r\nSaint Patrick\xe2\x80\x99s Day supplement. Containing the new addresses of all the\r\ncuckolds in Dublin.\r\n\r\n(The very reverend Canon O\xe2\x80\x99Hanlon in cloth of gold cope elevates and\r\nexposes a marble timepiece. Before him Father Conroy and the reverend\r\nJohn Hughes S. J. bend low.)\r\n\r\nTHE TIMEPIECE: (Unportalling.)\r\n\r\n     Cuckoo.\r\n     Cuckoo.\r\n     Cuckoo.\r\n\r\n(The brass quoits of a bed are heard to jingle.)\r\n\r\nTHE QUOITS: Jigjag. Jigajiga. Jigjag.\r\n\r\n(A panel of fog rolls back rapidly, revealing rapidly in the jurybox\r\nthe faces of Martin Cunningham, foreman, silkhatted, Jack Power, Simon\r\nDedalus, Tom Kernan, Ned Lambert, John Henry Menton, Myles Crawford,\r\nLenehan, Paddy Leonard, Nosey Flynn, M\xe2\x80\x99Coy and the featureless face of a\r\nNameless One.)\r\n\r\nTHE NAMELESS ONE: Bareback riding. Weight for age. Gob, he organised\r\nher.\r\n\r\nTHE JURORS: (All their heads turned to his voice.) Really?\r\n\r\nTHE NAMELESS ONE: (Snarls.) Arse over tip. Hundred shillings to five.\r\n\r\nTHE JURORS: (All their heads lowered in assent.) Most of us thought as\r\nmuch.\r\n\r\nFIRST WATCH: He is a marked man. Another girl\xe2\x80\x99s plait cut. Wanted: Jack\r\nthe Ripper. A thousand pounds reward.\r\n\r\nSECOND WATCH: (Awed, whispers.) And in black. A mormon. Anarchist.\r\n\r\nTHE CRIER: (Loudly.) Whereas Leopold Bloom of no fixed abode is a\r\nwellknown dynamitard, forger, bigamist, bawd and cuckold and a public\r\nnuisance to the citizens of Dublin and whereas at this commission of\r\nassizes the most honourable...\r\n\r\n(His Honour, sir Frederick Falkiner, recorder of Dublin, in judicial\r\ngarb of grey stone rises from the bench, stonebearded. He bears in his\r\narms an umbrella sceptre. From his forehead arise starkly the Mosaic\r\nramshorns.)\r\n\r\nTHE RECORDER: I will put an end to this white slave traffic and rid\r\nDublin of this odious pest. Scandalous! (He dons the black cap.) Let him\r\nbe taken, Mr Subsheriff, from the dock where he now stands and detained\r\nin custody in Mountjoy prison during His Majesty\xe2\x80\x99s pleasure and there be\r\nhanged by the neck until he is dead and therein fail not at your peril\r\nor may the Lord have mercy on your soul. Remove him. (A black skullcap\r\ndescends upon his head.)\r\n\r\n(The subsheriff Long John Fanning appears, smoking a pungent Henry\r\nClay.)\r\n\r\nLONG JOHN FANNING: (Scowls and calls with rich rolling utterance.)\r\nWho\xe2\x80\x99ll hang Judas Iscariot?\r\n\r\n(H. Rumbold, master barber, in a bloodcoloured jerkin and tanner\xe2\x80\x99s\r\napron, a rope coiled over his shoulder, mounts the block. A life\r\npreserver and a nailstudded bludgeon are stuck in his belt. He rubs\r\ngrimly his grappling hands, knobbed with knuckledusters.)\r\n\r\nRUMBOLD: (To the recorder with sinister familiarity.) Hanging Harry,\r\nyour Majesty, the Mersey terror. Five guineas a jugular. Neck or\r\nnothing.\r\n\r\n(The bells of George\xe2\x80\x99s church toll slowly, loud dark iron.)\r\n\r\nTHE BELLS: Heigho! Heigho!\r\n\r\nBLOOM: (Desperately.) Wait. Stop. Gulls. Good heart. I saw. Innocence.\r\nGirl in the monkeyhouse. Zoo. Lewd chimpanzee. (Breathlessly.) Pelvic\r\nbasin. Her artless blush unmanned me. (Overcome with emotion.) I left\r\nthe precincts. (He turns to a figure in the crowd, appealing.) Hynes,\r\nmay I speak to you? You know me. That three shillings you can keep. If\r\nyou want a little more...\r\n\r\nHYNES: (Coldly.) You are a perfect stranger.\r\n\r\nSECOND WATCH: (Points to the corner.) The bomb is here.\r\n\r\nFIRST WATCH: Infernal machine with a time fuse.\r\n\r\nBLOOM: No, no. Pig\xe2\x80\x99s feet. I was at a funeral.\r\n\r\nFIRST WATCH: (Draws his truncheon.) Liar!\r\n\r\n(The beagle lifts his snout, showing the grey scorbutic face of Paddy\r\nDignam. He has gnawed all. He exhales a putrid carcasefed breath.\r\nHe grows to human size and shape. His dachshund coat becomes a brown\r\nmortuary habit. His green eye flashes bloodshot. Half of one ear, all\r\nthe nose and both thumbs are ghouleaten.)\r\n\r\nPADDY DIGNAM: (In a hollow voice.) It is true. It was my funeral. Doctor\r\nFinucane pronounced life extinct when I succumbed to the disease from\r\nnatural causes.\r\n\r\n(He lifts his mutilated ashen face moonwards and bays lugubriously.)\r\n\r\nBLOOM: (In triumph.) You hear?\r\n\r\nPADDY DIGNAM: Bloom, I am Paddy Dignam\xe2\x80\x99s spirit. List, list, O list!\r\n\r\nBLOOM: The voice is the voice of Esau.\r\n\r\nSECOND WATCH: (Blesses himself.) How is that possible?\r\n\r\nFIRST WATCH: It is not in the penny catechism.\r\n\r\nPADDY DIGNAM: By metempsychosis. Spooks.\r\n\r\nA VOICE: O rocks.\r\n\r\nPADDY DIGNAM: (Earnestly.) Once I was in the employ of Mr J. H. Menton,\r\nsolicitor, commissioner for oaths and affidavits, of 27 Bachelor\xe2\x80\x99s Walk.\r\nNow I am defunct, the wall of the heart hypertrophied. Hard lines. The\r\npoor wife was awfully cut up. How is she bearing it? Keep her off that\r\nbottle of sherry. (He looks round him.) A lamp. I must satisfy an animal\r\nneed. That buttermilk didn\xe2\x80\x99t agree with me.\r\n\r\n(The portly figure of John O\xe2\x80\x99Connell, caretaker, stands forth, holding\r\na bunch of keys tied with crape. Beside him stands Father Coffey,\r\nchaplain, toadbellied, wrynecked, in a surplice and bandanna nightcap,\r\nholding sleepily a staff of twisted poppies.)\r\n\r\nFATHER COFFEY: (Yawns, then chants with a hoarse croak.) Namine. Jacobs.\r\nVobiscuits. Amen.\r\n\r\nJOHN O\xe2\x80\x99CONNELL: (Foghorns stormily through his megaphone.) Dignam,\r\nPatrick T, deceased.\r\n\r\nPADDY DIGNAM: (With pricked up ears, winces.) Overtones. (He wriggles\r\nforward and places an ear to the ground.) My master\xe2\x80\x99s voice!\r\n\r\nJOHN O\xe2\x80\x99CONNELL: Burial docket letter number U. P. eightyfive thousand.\r\nField seventeen. House of Keys. Plot, one hundred and one.\r\n\r\n(Paddy Dignam listens with visible effort, thinking, his tail\r\nstiffpointed, his ears cocked.)\r\n\r\nPADDY DIGNAM: Pray for the repose of his soul.\r\n\r\n(He worms down through a coalhole, his brown habit trailing its tether\r\nover rattling pebbles. After him toddles an obese grandfather rat on\r\nfungus turtle paws under a grey carapace. Dignam\xe2\x80\x99s voice, muffled, is\r\nheard baying under ground: Dignam\xe2\x80\x99s dead and gone below. Tom Rochford,\r\nrobinredbreasted, in cap and breeches, jumps from his twocolumned\r\nmachine.)\r\n\r\nTOM ROCHFORD: (A hand to his breastbone, bows.) Reuben J. A florin I\r\nfind him. (He fixes the manhole with a resolute stare.) My turn now on.\r\nFollow me up to Carlow.\r\n\r\n(He executes a daredevil salmon leap in the air and is engulfed in the\r\ncoalhole. Two discs on the columns wobble, eyes of nought. All recedes.\r\nBloom plodges forward again through the sump. Kisses chirp amid\r\nthe rifts of fog. A piano sounds. He stands before a lighted house,\r\nlistening. The kisses, winging from their bowers, fly about him,\r\ntwittering, warbling, cooing.)\r\n\r\nTHE KISSES: (Warbling.) Leo! (Twittering.) Icky licky micky sticky for\r\nLeo! (Cooing.) Coo coocoo! Yummyyum, Womwom! (Warbling.) Big comebig!\r\nPirouette! Leopopold! (Twittering.) Leeolee! (Warbling.) O Leo!\r\n\r\n(They rustle, flutter upon his garments, alight, bright giddy flecks,\r\nsilvery sequins.)\r\n\r\nBLOOM: A man\xe2\x80\x99s touch. Sad music. Church music. Perhaps here.\r\n\r\n(Zoe Higgins, a young whore in a sapphire slip, closed with three bronze\r\nbuckles, a slim black velvet fillet round her throat, nods, trips down\r\nthe steps and accosts him.)\r\n\r\nZOE: Are you looking for someone? He\xe2\x80\x99s inside with his friend.\r\n\r\nBLOOM: Is this Mrs Mack\xe2\x80\x99s?\r\n\r\nZOE: No, eightyone. Mrs Cohen\xe2\x80\x99s. You might go farther and fare worse.\r\nMother Slipperslapper. (Familiarly.) She\xe2\x80\x99s on the job herself tonight\r\nwith the vet her tipster that gives her all the winners and pays for\r\nher son in Oxford. Working overtime but her luck\xe2\x80\x99s turned today.\r\n(Suspiciously.) You\xe2\x80\x99re not his father, are you?\r\n\r\nBLOOM: Not I!\r\n\r\nZOE: You both in black. Has little mousey any tickles tonight?\r\n\r\n(His skin, alert, feels her fingertips approach. A hand glides over his\r\nleft thigh.)\r\n\r\nZOE: How\xe2\x80\x99s the nuts?\r\n\r\nBLOOM: Off side. Curiously they are on the right. Heavier, I suppose.\r\nOne in a million my tailor, Mesias, says.\r\n\r\nZOE: (In sudden alarm.) You\xe2\x80\x99ve a hard chancre.\r\n\r\nBLOOM: Not likely.\r\n\r\nZOE: I feel it.\r\n\r\n(Her hand slides into his left trouser pocket and brings out a hard\r\nblack shrivelled potato. She regards it and Bloom with dumb moist lips.)\r\n\r\nBLOOM: A talisman. Heirloom.\r\n\r\nZOE: For Zoe? For keeps? For being so nice, eh?\r\n\r\n(She puts the potato greedily into a pocket then links his arm, cuddling\r\nhim with supple warmth. He smiles uneasily. Slowly, note by note,\r\noriental music is played. He gazes in the tawny crystal of her eyes,\r\nringed with kohol. His smile softens.)\r\n\r\nZOE: You\xe2\x80\x99ll know me the next time.\r\n\r\nBLOOM: (Forlornly.) I never loved a dear gazelle but it was sure to...\r\n\r\n(Gazelles are leaping, feeding on the mountains. Near are lakes. Round\r\ntheir shores file shadows black of cedargroves. Aroma rises, a strong\r\nhairgrowth of resin. It burns, the orient, a sky of sapphire, cleft by\r\nthe bronze flight of eagles. Under it lies the womancity, nude, white,\r\nstill, cool, in luxury. A fountain murmurs among damask roses. Mammoth\r\nroses murmur of scarlet winegrapes. A wine of shame, lust, blood exudes,\r\nstrangely murmuring.)\r\n\r\nZOE: (Murmuring singsong with the music, her odalisk lips lusciously\r\nsmeared with salve of swinefat and rosewater.) Schorach ani wenowach,\r\nbenoith Hierushaloim.\r\n\r\nBLOOM: (Fascinated.) I thought you were of good stock by your accent.\r\n\r\nZOE: And you know what thought did?\r\n\r\n(She bites his ear gently with little goldstopped teeth, sending on\r\nhim a cloying breath of stale garlic. The roses draw apart, disclose a\r\nsepulchre of the gold of kings and their mouldering bones.)\r\n\r\nBLOOM: (Draws back, mechanically caressing her right bub with a flat\r\nawkward hand.) Are you a Dublin girl?\r\n\r\nZOE: (Catches a stray hair deftly and twists it to her coil.) No bloody\r\nfear. I\xe2\x80\x99m English. Have you a swaggerroot?\r\n\r\nBLOOM: (As before.) Rarely smoke, dear. Cigar now and then. Childish\r\ndevice. (Lewdly.) The mouth can be better engaged than with a cylinder\r\nof rank weed.\r\n\r\nZOE: Go on. Make a stump speech out of it.\r\n\r\nBLOOM: (In workman\xe2\x80\x99s corduroy overalls, black gansy with red floating\r\ntie and apache cap.) Mankind is incorrigible. Sir Walter Ralegh brought\r\nfrom the new world that potato and that weed, the one a killer of\r\npestilence by absorption, the other a poisoner of the ear, eye, heart,\r\nmemory, will, understanding, all. That is to say he brought the poison\r\na hundred years before another person whose name I forget brought the\r\nfood. Suicide. Lies. All our habits. Why, look at our public life!\r\n\r\n(Midnight chimes from distant steeples.)\r\n\r\nTHE CHIMES: Turn again, Leopold! Lord mayor of Dublin!\r\n\r\nBLOOM: (In alderman\xe2\x80\x99s gown and chain.) Electors of Arran Quay, Inns\r\nQuay, Rotunda, Mountjoy and North Dock, better run a tramline, I say,\r\nfrom the cattlemarket to the river. That\xe2\x80\x99s the music of the future.\r\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s my programme. Cui bono? But our bucaneering Vanderdeckens in\r\ntheir phantom ship of finance...\r\n\r\nAN ELECTOR: Three times three for our future chief magistrate!\r\n\r\n(The aurora borealis of the torchlight procession leaps.)\r\n\r\nTHE TORCHBEARERS: Hooray!\r\n\r\n(Several wellknown burgesses, city magnates and freemen of the city\r\nshake hands with Bloom and congratulate him. Timothy Harrington, late\r\nthrice Lord Mayor of Dublin, imposing in mayoral scarlet, gold chain and\r\nwhite silk tie, confers with councillor Lorcan Sherlock, locum tenens.\r\nThey nod vigorously in agreement.)\r\n\r\nLATE LORD MAYOR HARRINGTON: (In scarlet robe with mace, gold mayoral\r\nchain and large white silk scarf.) That alderman sir Leo Bloom\xe2\x80\x99s speech\r\nbe printed at the expense of the ratepayers. That the house in which\r\nhe was born be ornamented with a commemorative tablet and that the\r\nthoroughfare hitherto known as Cow Parlour off Cork street be henceforth\r\ndesignated Boulevard Bloom.\r\n\r\nCOUNCILLOR LORCAN SHERLOCK: Carried unanimously.\r\n\r\nBLOOM: (Impassionedly.) These flying Dutchmen or lying Dutchmen as\r\nthey recline in their upholstered poop, casting dice, what reck they?\r\nMachines is their cry, their chimera, their panacea. Laboursaving\r\napparatuses, supplanters, bugbears, manufactured monsters for mutual\r\nmurder, hideous hobgoblins produced by a horde of capitalistic lusts\r\nupon our prostituted labour. The poor man starves while they are\r\ngrassing their royal mountain stags or shooting peasants and phartridges\r\nin their purblind pomp of pelf and power. But their reign is rover for\r\nrever and ever and ev...\r\n\r\n(Prolonged applause. Venetian masts, maypoles and festal arches spring\r\nup. A streamer bearing the legends Cead Mile Failte and Mah Ttob Melek\r\nIsrael spans the street. All the windows are thronged with sightseers,\r\nchiefly ladies. Along the route the regiments of the Royal Dublin\r\nFusiliers, the King\xe2\x80\x99s own Scottish Borderers, the Cameron Highlanders\r\nand the Welsh Fusiliers, standing to attention, keep back the crowd.\r\nBoys from High school are perched on the lampposts, telegraph poles,\r\nwindowsills, cornices, gutters, chimneypots, railings, rainspouts,\r\nwhistling and cheering. The pillar of the cloud appears. A fife and\r\ndrum band is heard in the distance playing the Kol Nidre. The beaters\r\napproach with imperial eagles hoisted, trailing banners and waving\r\noriental palms. The chryselephantine papal standard rises high,\r\nsurrounded by pennons of the civic flag. The van of the procession\r\nappears headed by John Howard Parnell, city marshal, in a chessboard\r\ntabard, the Athlone Poursuivant and Ulster King of Arms. They are\r\nfollowed by the Right Honourable Joseph Hutchinson, lord mayor of\r\nDublin, his lordship the lord mayor of Cork, their worships the\r\nmayors of Limerick, Galway, Sligo and Waterford, twentyeight Irish\r\nrepresentative peers, sirdars, grandees and maharajahs bearing the cloth\r\nof estate, the Dublin Metropolitan Fire Brigade, the chapter of the\r\nsaints of finance in their plutocratic order of precedence, the bishop\r\nof Down and Connor, His Eminence Michael cardinal Logue, archbishop of\r\nArmagh, primate of all Ireland, His Grace, the most reverend Dr William\r\nAlexander, archbishop of Armagh, primate of all Ireland, the chief\r\nrabbi, the presbyterian moderator, the heads of the baptist, anabaptist,\r\nmethodist and Moravian chapels and the honorary secretary of the society\r\nof friends. After them march the guilds and trades and trainbands\r\nwith flying colours: coopers, bird fanciers, millwrights, newspaper\r\ncanvassers, law scriveners, masseurs, vintners, trussmakers,\r\nchimneysweeps, lard refiners, tabinet and poplin weavers, farriers,\r\nItalian warehousemen, church decorators, bootjack manufacturers,\r\nundertakers, silk mercers, lapidaries, salesmasters, corkcutters,\r\nassessors of fire losses, dyers and cleaners, export bottlers,\r\nfellmongers, ticketwriters, heraldic seal engravers, horse repository\r\nhands, bullion brokers, cricket and archery outfitters, riddlemakers,\r\negg and potato factors, hosiers and glovers, plumbing contractors. After\r\nthem march gentlemen of the bedchamber, Black Rod, Deputy Garter,\r\nGold Stick, the master of horse, the lord great chamberlain, the earl\r\nmarshal, the high constable carrying the sword of state, saint Stephen\xe2\x80\x99s\r\niron crown, the chalice and bible. Four buglers on foot blow a sennet.\r\nBeefeaters reply, winding clarions of welcome. Under an arch of triumph\r\nBloom appears, bareheaded, in a crimson velvet mantle trimmed with\r\nermine, bearing Saint Edward\xe2\x80\x99s staff, the orb and sceptre with the dove,\r\nthe curtana. He is seated on a milkwhite horse with long flowing crimson\r\ntail, richly caparisoned, with golden headstall. Wild excitement. The\r\nladies from their balconies throw down rosepetals. The air is perfumed\r\nwith essences. The men cheer. Bloom\xe2\x80\x99s boys run amid the bystanders with\r\nbranches of hawthorn and wrenbushes.)\r\n\r\nBLOOM\xe2\x80\x99S BOYS:\r\n\r\n     The wren, the wren,\r\n     The king of all birds,\r\n     Saint Stephen\xe2\x80\x99s his day\r\n     Was caught in the furze.\r\n\r\nA BLACKSMITH: (Murmurs.) For the honour of God! And is that Bloom? He\r\nscarcely looks thirtyone.\r\n\r\nA PAVIOR AND FLAGGER: That\xe2\x80\x99s the famous Bloom now, the world\xe2\x80\x99s greatest\r\nreformer. Hats off!\r\n\r\n(All uncover their heads. Women whisper eagerly.)\r\n\r\nA MILLIONAIRESS: (Richly.) Isn\xe2\x80\x99t he simply wonderful?\r\n\r\nA NOBLEWOMAN: (Nobly.) All that man has seen!\r\n\r\nA FEMINIST: (Masculinely.) And done!\r\n\r\nA BELLHANGER: A classic face! He has the forehead of a thinker.\r\n\r\n(Bloom\xe2\x80\x99s weather. A sunburst appears in the northwest.)\r\n\r\nTHE BISHOP OF DOWN AND CONNOR: I here present your undoubted\r\nemperor-president and king-chairman, the most serene and potent and very\r\npuissant ruler of this realm. God save Leopold the First!\r\n\r\nALL: God save Leopold the First!\r\n\r\nBLOOM: (In dalmatic and purple mantle, to the bishop of Down and Connor,\r\nwith dignity.) Thanks, somewhat eminent sir.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM, ARCHBISHOP OF ARMAGH: (In purple stock and shovel hat.)\r\nWill you to your power cause law and mercy to be executed in all your\r\njudgments in Ireland and territories thereunto belonging?\r\n\r\nBLOOM: (Placing his right hand on his testicles, swears.) So may the\r\nCreator deal with me. All this I promise to do.\r\n\r\nMICHAEL, ARCHBISHOP OF ARMAGH: (Pours a cruse of hairoil over Bloom\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhead.) Gaudium magnum annuntio vobis. Habemus carneficem. Leopold,\r\nPatrick, Andrew, David, George, be thou anointed!\r\n\r\n(Bloom assumes a mantle of cloth of gold and puts on a ruby ring. He\r\nascends and stands on the stone of destiny. The representative peers put\r\non at the same time their twentyeight crowns. Joybells ring in Christ\r\nchurch, Saint Patrick\xe2\x80\x99s, George\xe2\x80\x99s and gay Malahide. Mirus bazaar\r\nfireworks go up from all sides with symbolical phallopyrotechnic\r\ndesigns. The peers do homage, one by one, approaching and genuflecting.)\r\n\r\nTHE PEERS: I do become your liege man of life and limb to earthly\r\nworship.\r\n\r\n(Bloom holds up his right hand on which sparkles the Koh-i-Noor diamond.\r\nHis palfrey neighs. Immediate silence. Wireless intercontinental and\r\ninterplanetary transmitters are set for reception of message.)\r\n\r\nBLOOM: My subjects! We hereby nominate our faithful charger Copula Felix\r\nhereditary Grand Vizier and announce that we have this day repudiated\r\nour former spouse and have bestowed our royal hand upon the princess\r\nSelene, the splendour of night.\r\n\r\n(The former morganatic spouse of Bloom is hastily removed in the Black\r\nMaria. The princess Selene, in moonblue robes, a silver crescent on her\r\nhead, descends from a Sedan chair, borne by two giants. An outburst of\r\ncheering.)\r\n\r\nJOHN HOWARD PARNELL: (Raises the royal standard.) Illustrious Bloom!\r\nSuccessor to my famous brother!\r\n\r\nBLOOM: (Embraces John Howard Parnell.) We thank you from our heart,\r\nJohn, for this right royal welcome to green Erin, the promised land of\r\nour common ancestors.\r\n\r\n(The freedom of the city is presented to him embodied in a charter. The\r\nkeys of Dublin, crossed on a crimson cushion, are given to him. He shows\r\nall that he is wearing green socks.)\r\n\r\nTOM KERNAN: You deserve it, your honour.\r\n\r\nBLOOM: On this day twenty years ago we overcame the hereditary enemy at\r\nLadysmith. Our howitzers and camel swivel guns played on his lines with\r\ntelling effect. Half a league onward! They charge! All is lost now! Do\r\nwe yield? No! We drive them headlong! Lo! We charge! Deploying to the\r\nleft our light horse swept across the heights of Plevna and, uttering\r\ntheir warcry Bonafide Sabaoth, sabred the Saracen gunners to a man.\r\n\r\nTHE CHAPEL OF FREEMAN TYPESETTERS: Hear! Hear!\r\n\r\nJOHN WYSE NOLAN: There\xe2\x80\x99s the man that got away James Stephens.\r\n\r\nA BLUECOAT SCHOOLBOY: Bravo!\r\n\r\nAN OLD RESIDENT: You\xe2\x80\x99re a credit to your country, sir, that\xe2\x80\x99s what you\r\nare.\r\n\r\nAN APPLEWOMAN: He\xe2\x80\x99s a man like Ireland wants.\r\n\r\nBLOOM: My beloved subjects, a new era is about to dawn. I, Bloom, tell\r\nyou verily it is even now at hand. Yea, on the word of a Bloom, ye shall\r\nere long enter into the golden city which is to be, the new Bloomusalem\r\nin the Nova Hibernia of the future.\r\n\r\n(Thirtytwo workmen, wearing rosettes, from all the counties of Ireland,\r\nunder the guidance of Derwan the builder, construct the new Bloomusalem.\r\nIt is a colossal edifice with crystal roof, built in the shape of a\r\nhuge pork kidney, containing forty thousand rooms. In the course of its\r\nextension several buildings and monuments are demolished. Government\r\noffices are temporarily transferred to railway sheds. Numerous houses\r\nare razed to the ground. The inhabitants are lodged in barrels and\r\nboxes, all marked in red with the letters: L. B. Several paupers\r\nfall from a ladder. A part of the walls of Dublin, crowded with loyal\r\nsightseers, collapses.)\r\n\r\nTHE SIGHTSEERS: (Dying.) Morituri te salutant. (They die.)\r\n\r\n(A man in a brown macintosh springs up through a trapdoor. He points an\r\nelongated finger at Bloom.)\r\n\r\nTHE MAN IN THE MACINTOSH: Don\xe2\x80\x99t you believe a word he says. That man is\r\nLeopold M\xe2\x80\x99Intosh, the notorious fireraiser. His real name is Higgins.\r\n\r\nBLOOM: Shoot him! Dog of a christian! So much for M\xe2\x80\x99Intosh!\r\n\r\n(A cannonshot. The man in the macintosh disappears. Bloom with his\r\nsceptre strikes down poppies. The instantaneous deaths of many\r\npowerful enemies, graziers, members of parliament, members of standing\r\ncommittees, are reported.

The lady Gwendolen Dubedat bursts\r\nthrough the throng, leaps on his horse and kisses him on both cheeks\r\namid great acclamation. A magnesium flashlight photograph is taken.\r\nBabes and sucklings are held up.)\r\n\r\nTHE WOMEN: Little father! Little father!\r\n\r\nTHE BABES AND SUCKLINGS:\r\n\r\n     Clap clap hands till Poldy comes home,\r\n     Cakes in his pocket for Leo alone.\r\n\r\n(Bloom, bending down, pokes Baby Boardman gently in the stomach.)\r\n\r\nBABY BOARDMAN: (Hiccups, curdled milk flowing from his mouth.)

A Peter O\xe2\x80\x99Brien!\r\n\r\nNOSEY FLYNN: Where do I draw the five pounds?\r\n\r\nPISSER BURKE: For bladder trouble?\r\n\r\nBLOOM:\r\n\r\n     Acid. nit. hydrochlor. dil., 20 minims\r\n     Tinct. nux vom., 5 minims\r\n     Extr. taraxel. lig., 30 minims.\r\n     Aq. dis. ter in die.\r\n\r\nCHRIS CALLINAN: What is the parallax of the subsolar ecliptic of\r\nAldebaran?\r\n\r\nBLOOM: Pleased to hear from you, Chris. K. 11.\r\n\r\nJOE HYNES: Why aren\xe2\x80\x99t you in uniform?\r\n\r\nBLOOM: When my progenitor of sainted memory wore the uniform of the\r\nAustrian despot in a dank prison where was yours?\r\n\r\nBEN DOLLARD: Pansies?\r\n\r\nBLOOM: Embellish (beautify) suburban gardens.\r\n\r\nBEN DOLLARD: When twins arrive?\r\n\r\nBLOOM: Father (pater, dad) starts thinking.\r\n\r\nLARRY O\xe2\x80\x99ROURKE: An eightday licence for my new premises. You remember\r\nme, sir Leo, when you were in number seven. I\xe2\x80\x99m sending around a dozen\r\nof stout for the missus.\r\n\r\nBLOOM: (Coldly.) You have the advantage of me. Lady Bloom accepts no\r\npresents.\r\n\r\nCROFTON: This is indeed a festivity.\r\n\r\nBLOOM: (Solemnly.) You call it a festivity. I call it a sacrament.\r\n\r\nALEXANDER KEYES: When will we have our own house of keys?\r\n\r\nBLOOM: I stand for the reform of municipal morals and the plain ten\r\ncommandments. New worlds for old. Union of all, jew, moslem and gentile.\r\nThree acres and a cow for all children of nature. Saloon motor hearses.\r\nCompulsory manual labour for all. All parks open to the public day and\r\nnight. Electric dishscrubbers. Tuberculosis, lunacy, war and mendicancy\r\nmust now cease. General amnesty, weekly carnival with masked licence,\r\nbonuses for all, esperanto the universal language with universal\r\nbrotherhood. No more patriotism of barspongers and dropsical impostors.\r\nFree money, free rent, free love and a free lay church in a free lay\r\nstate.\r\n\r\nO\xe2\x80\x99MADDEN BURKE: Free fox in a free henroost.\r\n\r\nDAVY BYRNE: (Yawning.) Iiiiiiiiiaaaaaaach!\r\n\r\nBLOOM: Mixed races and mixed marriage.\r\n\r\nLENEHAN: What about mixed bathing?\r\n\r\n(Bloom explains to those near him his schemes for social regeneration.\r\nAll agree with him. The keeper of the Kildare street museum appears,\r\ndragging a lorry on which are the shaking statues of several naked\r\ngoddesses, Venus Callipyge, Venus Pandemos, Venus Metempsychosis, and\r\nplaster figures, also naked, representing the new nine muses, Commerce,\r\nOperatic Music, Amor, Publicity, Manufacture, Liberty of Speech, Plural\r\nVoting, Gastronomy, Private Hygiene, Seaside Concert Entertainments,\r\nPainless Obstetrics and Astronomy for the People.)\r\n\r\nFATHER FARLEY: He is an episcopalian, an agnostic, an anythingarian\r\nseeking to overthrow our holy faith.\r\n\r\nMRS RIORDAN: (Tears up her will.) I\xe2\x80\x99m disappointed in you! You bad man!\r\n\r\nMOTHER GROGAN: (Removes her boot to throw it at Bloom.) You beast! You\r\nabominable person!\r\n\r\nNOSEY FLYNN: Give us a tune, Bloom. One of the old sweet songs.\r\n\r\nBLOOM: (With rollicking humour.)\r\n\r\n     I vowed that I never would leave her,\r\n     She turned out a cruel deceiver.\r\n     With my tooraloom tooraloom tooraloom tooraloom.\r\n\r\nHOPPY HOLOHAN: Good old Bloom! There\xe2\x80\x99s nobody like him after all.\r\n\r\nPADDY LEONARD: Stage Irishman!\r\n\r\nBLOOM: What railway opera is like a tramline in Gibraltar? The Rows of\r\nCasteele.\r\n\r\n(Laughter.)\r\n\r\nLENEHAN: Plagiarist! Down with Bloom!\r\n\r\nTHE VEILED SIBYL: (Enthusiastically.) I\xe2\x80\x99m a Bloomite and I glory in it.\r\nI believe in him in spite of all. I\xe2\x80\x99d give my life for him, the funniest\r\nman on earth.\r\n\r\nBLOOM: (Winks at the bystanders.) I bet she\xe2\x80\x99s a bonny lassie.\r\n\r\nTHEODORE PUREFOY: (In fishingcap and oilskin jacket.) He employs a\r\nmechanical device to frustrate the sacred ends of nature.\r\n\r\nTHE VEILED SIBYL: (Stabs herself.) My hero god! (She dies.)\r\n\r\n(Many most attractive and enthusiastic women also commit suicide by\r\nstabbing, drowning, drinking prussic acid, aconite, arsenic, opening\r\ntheir veins, refusing food, casting themselves under steamrollers, from\r\nthe top of Nelson\xe2\x80\x99s Pillar, into the great vat of Guinness\xe2\x80\x99s brewery,\r\nasphyxiating themselves by placing their heads in gasovens, hanging\r\nthemselves in stylish garters, leaping from windows of different\r\nstoreys.)\r\n\r\nALEXANDER J DOWIE: (Violently.) Fellowchristians and antiBloomites, the\r\nman called Bloom is from the roots of hell, a disgrace to christian\r\nmen. A fiendish libertine from his earliest years this stinking goat\r\nof Mendes gave precocious signs of infantile debauchery, recalling the\r\ncities of the plain, with a dissolute granddam. This vile hypocrite,\r\nbronzed with infamy, is the white bull mentioned in the Apocalypse.\r\nA worshipper of the Scarlet Woman, intrigue is the very breath of his\r\nnostrils. The stake faggots and the caldron of boiling oil are for him.\r\nCaliban!\r\n\r\nTHE MOB: Lynch him! Roast him! He\xe2\x80\x99s as bad as Parnell was. Mr Fox!\r\n\r\n(Mother Grogan throws her boot at Bloom. Several shopkeepers from upper\r\nand lower Dorset street throw objects of little or no commercial value,\r\nhambones, condensed milk tins, unsaleable cabbage, stale bread, sheep\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ntails, odd pieces of fat.)\r\n\r\nBLOOM: (Excitedly.) This is midsummer madness, some ghastly joke again.\r\nBy heaven, I am guiltless as the unsunned snow! It was my brother Henry.\r\nHe is my double. He lives in number 2 Dolphin\xe2\x80\x99s Barn. Slander, the\r\nviper, has wrongfully accused me. Fellowcountrymen, sgenl inn ban bata\r\ncoisde gan capall. I call on my old friend, Dr Malachi Mulligan, sex\r\nspecialist, to give medical testimony on my behalf.\r\n\r\nDR MULLIGAN: (In motor jerkin, green motorgoggles on his brow.) Dr\r\nBloom is bisexually abnormal. He has recently escaped from Dr Eustace\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nprivate asylum for demented gentlemen. Born out of bedlock hereditary\r\nepilepsy is present, the consequence of unbridled lust. Traces of\r\nelephantiasis have been discovered among his ascendants. There are\r\nmarked symptoms of chronic exhibitionism. Ambidexterity is also\r\nlatent. He is prematurely bald from selfabuse, perversely idealistic in\r\nconsequence, a reformed rake, and has metal teeth. In consequence of a\r\nfamily complex he has temporarily lost his memory and I believe him\r\nto be more sinned against than sinning. I have made a pervaginal\r\nexamination and, after application of the acid test to 5427 anal,\r\naxillary, pectoral and pubic hairs, I declare him to be virgo intacta.\r\n\r\n(Bloom holds his high grade hat over his genital organs.)\r\n\r\nDR MADDEN: Hypsospadia is also marked. In the interest of coming\r\ngenerations I suggest that the parts affected should be preserved in\r\nspirits of wine in the national teratological museum.\r\n\r\nDR CROTTHERS: I have examined the patient\xe2\x80\x99s urine. It is albuminoid.\r\nSalivation is insufficient, the patellar reflex intermittent.\r\n\r\nDR PUNCH COSTELLO: The fetor judaicus is most perceptible.\r\n\r\nDR DIXON: (Reads a bill of health.) Professor Bloom is a finished\r\nexample of the new womanly man. His moral nature is simple and lovable.\r\nMany have found him a dear man, a dear person. He is a rather quaint\r\nfellow on the whole, coy though not feebleminded in the medical sense.\r\nHe has written a really beautiful letter, a poem in itself, to the court\r\nmissionary of the Reformed Priests\xe2\x80\x99 Protection Society which clears up\r\neverything. He is practically a total abstainer and I can affirm that\r\nhe sleeps on a straw litter and eats the most Spartan food, cold dried\r\ngrocer\xe2\x80\x99s peas. He wears a hairshirt of pure Irish manufacture winter and\r\nsummer and scourges himself every Saturday. He was, I understand, at one\r\ntime a firstclass misdemeanant in Glencree reformatory. Another report\r\nstates that he was a very posthumous child. I appeal for clemency in the\r\nname of the most sacred word our vocal organs have ever been called upon\r\nto speak. He is about to have a baby.\r\n\r\n(General commotion and compassion. Women faint. A wealthy American makes\r\na street collection for Bloom. Gold and silver coins, blank cheques,\r\nbanknotes, jewels, treasury bonds, maturing bills of exchange, I. O.\r\nU\xe2\x80\x99s, wedding rings, watchchains, lockets, necklaces and bracelets are\r\nrapidly collected.)\r\n\r\nBLOOM: O, I so want to be a mother.\r\n\r\nMRS THORNTON: (In nursetender\xe2\x80\x99s gown.) Embrace me tight, dear. You\xe2\x80\x99ll be\r\nsoon over it. Tight, dear.\r\n\r\n(Bloom embraces her tightly and bears eight male yellow and white\r\nchildren. They appear on a redcarpeted staircase adorned with expensive\r\nplants. All the octuplets are handsome, with valuable metallic faces,\r\nwellmade, respectably dressed and wellconducted, speaking five modern\r\nlanguages fluently and interested in various arts and sciences. Each\r\nhas his name printed in legible letters on his shirtfront: Nasodoro,\r\nGoldfinger, Chrysostomos, Maindor\xc3\xa9e, Silversmile, Silberselber,\r\nVifargent, Panargyros. They are immediately appointed to positions of\r\nhigh public trust in several different countries as managing directors\r\nof banks, traffic managers of railways, chairmen of limited liability\r\ncompanies, vicechairmen of hotel syndicates.)\r\n\r\nA VOICE: Bloom, are you the Messiah ben Joseph or ben David?\r\n\r\nBLOOM: (Darkly.) You have said it.\r\n\r\nBROTHER BUZZ: Then perform a miracle like Father Charles.\r\n\r\nBANTAM LYONS: Prophesy who will win the Saint Leger.\r\n\r\n(Bloom walks on a net, covers his left eye with his left ear, passes\r\nthrough several walls, climbs Nelson\xe2\x80\x99s Pillar, hangs from the top ledge\r\nby his eyelids, eats twelve dozen oysters (shells included), heals\r\nseveral sufferers from king\xe2\x80\x99s evil, contracts his face so as to resemble\r\nmany historical personages, Lord Beaconsfield, Lord Byron, Wat Tyler,\r\nMoses of Egypt, Moses Maimonides, Moses Mendelssohn, Henry Irving, Rip\r\nvan Winkle, Kossuth, Jean Jacques Rousseau, Baron Leopold Rothschild,\r\nRobinson Crusoe, Sherlock Holmes, Pasteur, turns each foot\r\nsimultaneously in different directions, bids the tide turn back,\r\neclipses the sun by extending his little finger.)\r\n\r\nBRINI, PAPAL NUNCIO: (In papal zouave\xe2\x80\x99s uniform, steel cuirasses as\r\nbreastplate, armplates, thighplates, legplates, large profane moustaches\r\nand brown paper mitre.) Leopoldi autem generatio.

Bloom is a cod.\r\n\r\nCRAB: (In bushranger\xe2\x80\x99s kit.) What did you do in the cattlecreep behind\r\nKilbarrack?\r\n\r\nA FEMALE INFANT: (Shakes a rattle.) And under Ballybough bridge?\r\n\r\nA HOLLYBUSH: And in the devil\xe2\x80\x99s glen?\r\n\r\nBLOOM: (Blushes furiously all over from frons to nates, three tears\r\nfalling from his left eye.) Spare my past.\r\n\r\nTHE IRISH EVICTED TENANTS: (In bodycoats, kneebreeches, with Donnybrook\r\nfair shillelaghs.) Sjambok him!\r\n\r\n(Bloom with asses\xe2\x80\x99 ears seats himself in the pillory with crossed arms,\r\nhis feet protruding. He whistles Don Giovanni, a cenar teco. Artane\r\norphans, joining hands, caper round him. Girls of the Prison Gate\r\nMission, joining hands, caper round in the opposite direction.)\r\n\r\nTHE ARTANE ORPHANS:\r\n\r\n     You hig, you hog, you dirty dog!\r\n     You think the ladies love you!\r\n\r\nTHE PRISON GATE GIRLS:\r\n\r\n     If you see Kay\r\n     Tell him he may\r\n     See you in tea\r\n     Tell him from me.\r\n\r\nHORNBLOWER: (In ephod and huntingcap, announces.) And he shall carry the\r\nsins of the people to Azazel, the spirit which is in the wilderness, and\r\nto Lilith, the nighthag. And they shall stone him and defile him, yea,\r\nall from Agendath Netaim and from Mizraim, the land of Ham.\r\n\r\n(All the people cast soft pantomime stones at Bloom. Many bonafide\r\ntravellers and ownerless dogs come near him and defile him. Mastiansky\r\nand Citron approach in gaberdines, wearing long earlocks. They wag their\r\nbeards at Bloom.)\r\n\r\nMASTIANSKY AND CITRON: Belial! Laemlein of Istria, the false Messiah!\r\nAbulafia! Recant!\r\n\r\n(George R Mesias, Bloom\xe2\x80\x99s tailor, appears, a tailor\xe2\x80\x99s goose under his\r\narm, presenting a bill.)\r\n\r\nMESIAS: To alteration one pair trousers eleven shillings.\r\n\r\nBLOOM: (Rubs his hands cheerfully.) Just like old times. Poor Bloom!\r\n\r\n(Reuben J Dodd, blackbearded Iscariot, bad shepherd, bearing on his\r\nshoulders the drowned corpse of his son, approaches the pillory.)\r\n\r\nREUBEN J: (Whispers hoarsely.) The squeak is out. A split is gone for\r\nthe flatties. Nip the first rattler.\r\n\r\nTHE FIRE BRIGADE: Pflaap!\r\n\r\nBROTHER BUZZ: (Invests Bloom in a yellow habit with embroidery of\r\npainted flames and high pointed hat. He places a bag of gunpowder round\r\nhis neck and hands him over to the civil power, saying.) Forgive him his\r\ntrespasses.\r\n\r\n(Lieutenant Myers of the Dublin Fire Brigade by general request sets\r\nfire to Bloom. Lamentations.)\r\n\r\nTHE CITIZEN: Thank heaven!\r\n\r\nBLOOM: (In a seamless garment marked I. H. S. stands upright amid\r\nphoenix flames.) Weep not for me, O daughters of Erin.\r\n\r\n(He exhibits to Dublin reporters traces of burning. The daughters of\r\nErin, in black garments, with large prayerbooks and long lighted candles\r\nin their hands, kneel down and pray.)\r\n\r\nTHE DAUGHTERS OF ERIN:\r\n\r\n     Kidney of Bloom, pray for us\r\n     Flower of the Bath, pray for us\r\n     Mentor of Menton, pray for us\r\n     Canvasser for the Freeman, pray for us\r\n     Charitable Mason, pray for us\r\n     Wandering Soap, pray for us\r\n     Sweets of Sin, pray for us\r\n     Music without Words, pray for us\r\n     Reprover of the Citizen, pray for us\r\n     Friend of all Frillies, pray for us\r\n     Midwife Most Merciful, pray for us\r\n     Potato Preservative against Plague and Pestilence, pray for us.\r\n\r\n(A choir of six hundred voices, conducted by Vincent O\xe2\x80\x99Brien, sings\r\nthe chorus from Handel\xe2\x80\x99s Messiah Alleluia for the Lord God Omnipotent\r\nreigneth, accompanied on the organ by Joseph Glynn. Bloom becomes mute,\r\nshrunken, carbonised.)\r\n\r\nZOE: Talk away till you\xe2\x80\x99re black in the face.\r\n\r\nBLOOM: (In caubeen with clay pipe stuck in the band, dusty brogues, an\r\nemigrant\xe2\x80\x99s red handkerchief bundle in his hand, leading a black bogoak\r\npig by a sugaun, with a smile in his eye.) Let me be going now, woman of\r\nthe house, for by all the goats in Connemara I\xe2\x80\x99m after having the\r\nfather and mother of a bating. (With a tear in his eye.) All insanity.\r\nPatriotism, sorrow for the dead, music, future of the race. To be or not\r\nto be. Life\xe2\x80\x99s dream is o\xe2\x80\x99er. End it peacefully. They can live on. (He\r\ngazes far away mournfully.) I am ruined. A few pastilles of aconite. The\r\nblinds drawn. A letter. Then lie back to rest. (He breathes softly.) No\r\nmore. I have lived. Fare. Farewell.\r\n\r\nZOE: (Stiffly, her finger in her neckfillet.) Honest? Till the next\r\ntime. (She sneers.) Suppose you got up the wrong side of the bed or came\r\ntoo quick with your best girl. O, I can read your thoughts!\r\n\r\nBLOOM: (Bitterly.) Man and woman, love, what is it? A cork and bottle.\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m sick of it. Let everything rip.\r\n\r\nZOE: (In sudden sulks.) I hate a rotter that\xe2\x80\x99s insincere. Give a\r\nbleeding whore a chance.\r\n\r\nBLOOM: (Repentantly.) I am very disagreeable. You are a necessary evil.\r\nWhere are you from? London?\r\n\r\nZOE: (Glibly.) Hog\xe2\x80\x99s Norton where the pigs plays the organs. I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\nYorkshire born. (She holds his hand which is feeling for her nipple.) I\r\nsay, Tommy Tittlemouse. Stop that and begin worse. Have you cash for a\r\nshort time? Ten shillings?\r\n\r\nBLOOM: (Smiles, nods slowly.) More, houri, more.\r\n\r\nZOE: And more\xe2\x80\x99s mother? (She pats him offhandedly with velvet paws.) Are\r\nyou coming into the musicroom to see our new pianola? Come and I\xe2\x80\x99ll peel\r\noff.\r\n\r\nBLOOM: (Feeling his occiput dubiously with the unparalleled\r\nembarrassment of a harassed pedlar gauging the symmetry of her peeled\r\npears.) Somebody would be dreadfully jealous if she knew. The greeneyed\r\nmonster. (Earnestly.) You know how difficult it is. I needn\xe2\x80\x99t tell you.\r\n\r\nZOE: (Flattered.) What the eye can\xe2\x80\x99t see the heart can\xe2\x80\x99t grieve for.\r\n(She pats him.) Come.\r\n\r\nBLOOM: Laughing witch! The hand that rocks the cradle.\r\n\r\nZOE: Babby!\r\n\r\nBLOOM: (In babylinen and pelisse, bigheaded, with a caul of dark hair,\r\nfixes big eyes on her fluid slip and counts its bronze buckles with a\r\nchubby finger, his moist tongue lolling and lisping.) One two tlee: tlee\r\ntlwo tlone.\r\n\r\nTHE BUCKLES: Love me. Love me not. Love me.\r\n\r\nZOE: Silent means consent. (With little parted talons she captures his\r\nhand, her forefinger giving to his palm the passtouch of secret monitor,\r\nluring him to doom.) Hot hands cold gizzard.\r\n\r\n(He hesitates amid scents, music, temptations. She leads him towards the\r\nsteps, drawing him by the odour of her armpits, the vice of her painted\r\neyes, the rustle of her slip in whose sinuous folds lurks the lion reek\r\nof all the male brutes that have possessed her.)\r\n\r\nTHE MALE BRUTES: (Exhaling sulphur of rut and dung and ramping in their\r\nloosebox, faintly roaring, their drugged heads swaying to and fro.)\r\nGood!\r\n\r\n(Zoe and Bloom reach the doorway where two sister whores are seated.\r\nThey examine him curiously from under their pencilled brows and smile to\r\nhis hasty bow. He trips awkwardly.)\r\n\r\nZOE: (Her lucky hand instantly saving him.) Hoopsa! Don\xe2\x80\x99t fall upstairs.\r\n\r\nBLOOM: The just man falls seven times. (He stands aside at the\r\nthreshold.) After you is good manners.\r\n\r\nZOE: Ladies first, gentlemen after.\r\n\r\n(She crosses the threshold. He hesitates. She turns and, holding out her\r\nhands, draws him over. He hops. On the antlered rack of the hall hang\r\na man \xe2\x80\x98s hat and waterproof. Bloom uncovers himself but, seeing them,\r\nfrowns, then smiles, preoccupied. A door on the return landing is flung\r\nopen. A man in purple shirt and grey trousers, brownsocked, passes with\r\nan ape\xe2\x80\x99s gait, his bald head and goatee beard upheld, hugging a full\r\nwaterjugjar, his twotailed black braces dangling at heels. Averting his\r\nface quickly Bloom bends to examine on the halltable the spaniel eyes\r\nof a running fox: then, his lifted head sniffing, follows Zoe into\r\nthe musicroom. A shade of mauve tissuepaper dims the light of the\r\nchandelier. Round and round a moth flies, colliding, escaping. The\r\nfloor is covered with an oilcloth mosaic of jade and azure and cinnabar\r\nrhomboids. Footmarks are stamped over it in all senses, heel to heel,\r\nheel to hollow, toe to toe, feet locked, a morris of shuffling feet\r\nwithout body phantoms, all in a scrimmage higgledypiggledy. The walls\r\nare tapestried with a paper of yewfronds and clear glades. In the grate\r\nis spread a screen of peacock feathers. Lynch squats crosslegged on\r\nthe hearthrug of matted hair, his cap back to the front. With a wand he\r\nbeats time slowly. Kitty Ricketts, a bony pallid whore in navy costume,\r\ndoeskin gloves rolled back from a coral wristlet, a chain purse in\r\nher hand, sits perched on the edge of the table swinging her leg and\r\nglancing at herself in the gilt mirror over the mantelpiece. A tag\r\nof her corsetlace hangs slightly below her jacket. Lynch indicates\r\nmockingly the couple at the piano.)\r\n\r\nKITTY: (Coughs behind her hand.) She\xe2\x80\x99s a bit imbecillic. (She signs with\r\na waggling forefinger.) Blemblem. (Lynch lifts up her skirt and white\r\npetticoat with the wand. She settles them down quickly.) Respect\r\nyourself. (She hiccups, then bends quickly her sailor hat under which\r\nher hair glows, red with henna.) O, excuse!\r\n\r\nZOE: More limelight, Charley. (She goes to the chandelier and turns the\r\ngas full cock.)\r\n\r\nKITTY: (Peers at the gasjet.) What ails it tonight?\r\n\r\nLYNCH: (Deeply.) Enter a ghost and hobgoblins.\r\n\r\nZOE: Clap on the back for Zoe.\r\n\r\n(The wand in Lynch\xe2\x80\x99s hand flashes: a brass poker. Stephen stands at\r\nthe pianola on which sprawl his hat and ashplant. With two fingers he\r\nrepeats once more the series of empty fifths. Florry Talbot, a blond\r\nfeeble goosefat whore in a tatterdemalion gown of mildewed strawberry,\r\nlolls spreadeagle in the sofacorner, her limp forearm pendent over the\r\nbolster, listening. A heavy stye droops over her sleepy eyelid.)\r\n\r\nKITTY: (Hiccups again with a kick of her horsed foot.) O, excuse!\r\n\r\nZOE: (Promptly.) Your boy\xe2\x80\x99s thinking of you. Tie a knot on your shift.\r\n\r\n(Kitty Ricketts bends her head. Her boa uncoils, slides, glides over\r\nher shoulder, back, arm, chair to the ground. Lynch lifts the curled\r\ncatterpillar on his wand. She snakes her neck, nestling. Stephen glances\r\nbehind at the squatted figure with its cap back to the front.)\r\n\r\nSTEPHEN: As a matter of fact it is of no importance whether Benedetto\r\nMarcello found it or made it. The rite is the poet\xe2\x80\x99s rest. It may be an\r\nold hymn to Demeter or also illustrate C\xc5\x93la enarrant gloriam Domini.\r\nIt is susceptible of nodes or modes as far apart as hyperphrygian and\r\nmixolydian and of texts so divergent as priests haihooping round David\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nthat is Circe\xe2\x80\x99s or what am I saying Ceres\xe2\x80\x99 altar and David\xe2\x80\x99s tip\r\nfrom the stable to his chief bassoonist about the alrightness of his\r\nalmightiness. Mais nom de nom, that is another pair of trousers. Jetez\r\nla gourme. Faut que jeunesse se passe. (He stops, points at Lynch\xe2\x80\x99s cap,\r\nsmiles, laughs.) Which side is your knowledge bump?\r\n\r\nTHE CAP: (With saturnine spleen.) Bah! It is because it is. Woman\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nreason. Jewgreek is greekjew. Extremes meet. Death is the highest form\r\nof life. Bah!\r\n\r\nSTEPHEN: You remember fairly accurately all my errors, boasts, mistakes.\r\nHow long shall I continue to close my eyes to disloyalty? Whetstone!\r\n\r\nTHE CAP: Bah!\r\n\r\nSTEPHEN: Here\xe2\x80\x99s another for you. (He frowns.) The reason is because\r\nthe fundamental and the dominant are separated by the greatest possible\r\ninterval which...\r\n\r\nTHE CAP: Which? Finish.

Which.\r\n\r\nTHE CAP: Which?\r\n\r\n(Outside the gramophone begins to blare The Holy City.)\r\n\r\nSTEPHEN: (Abruptly.) What went forth to the ends of the world to\r\ntraverse not itself, God, the sun, Shakespeare, a commercial traveller,\r\nhaving itself traversed in reality itself becomes that self. Wait a\r\nmoment. Wait a second. Damn that fellow\xe2\x80\x99s noise in the street. Self\r\nwhich it itself was ineluctably preconditioned to become. Ecco!\r\n\r\nLYNCH: (With a mocking whinny of laughter grins at Bloom and Zoe\r\nHiggins.) What a learned speech, eh?\r\n\r\nZOE: (Briskly.) God help your head, he knows more than you have\r\nforgotten.\r\n\r\n(With obese stupidity Florry Talbot regards Stephen.)\r\n\r\nFLORRY: They say the last day is coming this summer.\r\n\r\nKITTY: No!\r\n\r\nZOE: (Explodes in laughter.) Great unjust God!\r\n\r\nFLORRY: (Offended.) Well, it was in the papers about Antichrist. O, my\r\nfoot\xe2\x80\x99s tickling.\r\n\r\n(Ragged barefoot newsboys, jogging a wagtail kite, patter past,\r\nyelling.)\r\n\r\nTHE NEWSBOYS: Stop press edition. Result of the rockinghorse races.

Florry Christ, Stephen\r\nChrist, Zoe Christ, Bloom Christ, Kitty Christ, Lynch Christ, it\xe2\x80\x99s up to\r\nyou to sense that cosmic force. Have we cold feet about the cosmos?\r\nNo. Be on the side of the angels. Be a prism. You have that something\r\nwithin, the higher self.

Big Brother up there, Mr President,\r\nyou hear what I done just been saying to you. Certainly, I sort of\r\nbelieve strong in you, Mr President.

Mr President, you come long\r\nand help me save our sisters dear. (He winks at his audience.) Our Mr\r\nPresident, he twig the whole lot and he aint saying nothing.\r\n\r\nKITTY-KATE: I forgot myself. In a weak moment I erred and did what I did\r\non Constitution hill. I was confirmed by the bishop and enrolled in\r\nthe brown scapular. My mother\xe2\x80\x99s sister married a Montmorency. It was a\r\nworking plumber was my ruination when I was pure.\r\n\r\nZOE-FANNY: I let him larrup it into me for the fun of it.\r\n\r\nFLORRY-TERESA: It was in consequence of a portwine beverage on top of\r\nHennessy\xe2\x80\x99s three star.

A cold seawind blows from his druid mouth. About his\r\nhead writhe eels and elvers. He is encrusted with weeds and shells. His\r\nright hand holds a bicycle pump. His left hand grasps a huge crayfish by\r\nits two talons.)\r\n\r\nMANANAUN MACLIR: (With a voice of waves.) Aum! Hek! Wal! Ak! Lub! Mor!\r\nMa! White yoghin of the gods.

On its\r\ncooperative dial glow the twelve signs of the zodiac. He wails with\r\nthe vehemence of the ocean.) Aum! Baum! Pyjaum! I am the light of the\r\nhomestead! I am the dreamery creamery butter.\r\n\r\n(A skeleton judashand strangles the light. The green light wanes to\r\nmauve. The gasjet wails whistling.)\r\n\r\nTHE GASJET: Pooah!

Here.\r\n\r\nZOE: (Her head perched aside in mock pride.) Is that the way to hand the\r\npot to a lady? (She stretches up to light the cigarette over the flame,\r\ntwirling it slowly, showing the brown tufts of her armpits. Lynch with\r\nhis poker lifts boldly a side of her slip. Bare from her garters up her\r\nflesh appears under the sapphire a nixie\xe2\x80\x99s green. She puffs calmly at\r\nher cigarette.) Can you see the beautyspot of my behind?\r\n\r\nLYNCH: I\xe2\x80\x99m not looking\r\n\r\nZOE: (Makes sheep\xe2\x80\x99s eyes.) No? You wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do a less thing. Would you\r\nsuck a lemon?\r\n\r\n(Squinting in mock shame she glances with sidelong meaning at Bloom,\r\nthen twists round towards him, pulling her slip free of the poker. Blue\r\nfluid again flows over her flesh. Bloom stands, smiling desirously,\r\ntwirling his thumbs. Kitty Ricketts licks her middle finger with her\r\nspittle and, gazing in the mirror, smooths both eyebrows. Lipoti Virag,\r\nbasilicogrammate, chutes rapidly down through the chimneyflue and struts\r\ntwo steps to the left on gawky pink stilts. He is sausaged into several\r\novercoats and wears a brown macintosh under which he holds a roll of\r\nparchment. In his left eye flashes the monocle of Cashel Boyle O\xe2\x80\x99Connor\r\nFitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell. On his head is perched an Egyptian pshent.\r\nTwo quills project over his ears.)\r\n\r\nVIRAG: (Heels together, bows.) My name is Virag Lipoti, of Szombathely.\r\n(He coughs thoughtfully, drily.) Promiscuous nakedness is much in\r\nevidence hereabouts, eh? Inadvertently her backview revealed the fact\r\nthat she is not wearing those rather intimate garments of which you\r\nare a particular devotee. The injection mark on the thigh I hope you\r\nperceived? Good.\r\n\r\nBLOOM: Granpapachi. But...\r\n\r\nVIRAG: Number two on the other hand, she of the cherry rouge and\r\ncoiffeuse white, whose hair owes not a little to our tribal elixir of\r\ngopherwood, is in walking costume and tightly staysed by her sit, I\r\nshould opine. Backbone in front, so to say. Correct me but I always\r\nunderstood that the act so performed by skittish humans with glimpses of\r\nlingerie appealed to you in virtue of its exhibitionististicicity. In a\r\nword. Hippogriff. Am I right?\r\n\r\nBLOOM: She is rather lean.\r\n\r\nVIRAG: (Not unpleasantly.) Absolutely! Well observed and those pannier\r\npockets of the skirt and slightly pegtop effect are devised to suggest\r\nbunchiness of hip. A new purchase at some monster sale for which a gull\r\nhas been mulcted. Meretricious finery to deceive the eye. Observe the\r\nattention to details of dustspecks. Never put on you tomorrow what you\r\ncan wear today. Parallax! (With a nervous twitch of his head.) Did you\r\nhear my brain go snap? Pollysyllabax!\r\n\r\nBLOOM: (An elbow resting in a hand, a forefinger against his cheek.) She\r\nseems sad.\r\n\r\nVIRAG: (Cynically, his weasel teeth bared yellow, draws down his left\r\neye with a finger and barks hoarsely.) Hoax! Beware of the flapper\r\nand bogus mournful. Lily of the alley. All possess bachelor\xe2\x80\x99s button\r\ndiscovered by Rualdus Columbus. Tumble her. Columble her. Chameleon.\r\n(More genially.) Well then, permit me to draw your attention to item\r\nnumber three. There is plenty of her visible to the naked eye. Observe\r\nthe mass of oxygenated vegetable matter on her skull. What ho, she\r\nbumps! The ugly duckling of the party, longcasted and deep in keel.\r\n\r\nBLOOM: (Regretfully.) When you come out without your gun.\r\n\r\nVIRAG: We can do you all brands, mild, medium and strong. Pay your\r\nmoney, take your choice. How happy could you be with either...\r\n\r\nBLOOM: With...?\r\n\r\nVIRAG: (His tongue upcurling.) Lyum! Look. Her beam is broad. She is\r\ncoated with quite a considerable layer of fat. Obviously mammal in\r\nweight of bosom you remark that she has in front well to the fore two\r\nprotuberances of very respectable dimensions, inclined to fall in the\r\nnoonday soupplate, while on her rere lower down are two additional\r\nprotuberances, suggestive of potent rectum and tumescent for palpation,\r\nwhich leave nothing to be desired save compactness. Such fleshy parts\r\nare the product of careful nurture. When coopfattened their livers\r\nreach an elephantine size. Pellets of new bread with fennygreek and\r\ngumbenjamin swamped down by potions of green tea endow them during their\r\nbrief existence with natural pincushions of quite colossal blubber. That\r\nsuits your book, eh? Fleshhotpots of Egypt to hanker after. Wallow in\r\nit. Lycopodium. (His throat twitches.) Slapbang! There he goes again.\r\n\r\nBLOOM: The stye I dislike.\r\n\r\nVIRAG: (Arches his eyebrows.) Contact with a goldring, they say.\r\nArgumentum ad feminam, as we said in old Rome and ancient Greece in the\r\nconsulship of Diplodocus and Ichthyosauros. For the rest Eve\xe2\x80\x99s sovereign\r\nremedy. Not for sale. Hire only. Huguenot. (He twitches.) It is a funny\r\nsound. (He coughs encouragingly.) But possibly it is only a wart. I\r\npresume you shall have remembered what I will have taught you on that\r\nhead? Wheatenmeal with honey and nutmeg.\r\n\r\nBLOOM: (Reflecting.) Wheatenmeal with lycopodium and syllabax. This\r\nsearching ordeal. It has been an unusually fatiguing day, a chapter of\r\naccidents. Wait. I mean, wartsblood spreads warts, you said...\r\n\r\nVIRAG: (Severely, his nose hardhumped, his side eye winking.) Stop\r\ntwirling your thumbs and have a good old thunk. See, you have forgotten.\r\nExercise your mnemotechnic. La causa \xc3\xa8 santa. Tara. Tara. (Aside.) He\r\nwill surely remember.\r\n\r\nBLOOM: Rosemary also did I understand you to say or willpower over\r\nparasitic tissues. Then nay no I have an inkling. The touch of a\r\ndeadhand cures. Mnemo?\r\n\r\nVIRAG: (Excitedly.) I say so. I say so. E\xe2\x80\x99en so. Technic. (He taps his\r\nparchmentroll energetically.) This book tells you how to act with all\r\ndescriptive particulars. Consult index for agitated fear of aconite,\r\nmelancholy of muriatic, priapic pulsatilla. Virag is going to talk about\r\namputation. Our old friend caustic. They must be starved. Snip off with\r\nhorsehair under the denned neck. But, to change the venue to the Bulgar\r\nand the Basque, have you made up your mind whether you like or dislike\r\nwomen in male habiliments? (With a dry snigger.) You intended to devote\r\nan entire year to the study of the religious problem and the summer\r\nmonths of 1886 to square the circle and win that million. Pomegranate!\r\nFrom the sublime to the ridiculous is but a step. Pyjamas, let us say?\r\nOr stockingette gussetted knickers, closed? Or, put we the case,\r\nthose complicated combinations, camiknickers? (He crows derisively.)\r\nKeekeereekee!\r\n\r\n(Bloom surveys uncertainly the three whores then gazes at the veiled\r\nmauve light, hearing the everflying moth.)\r\n\r\nBLOOM: I wanted then to have now concluded. Nightdress was never. Hence\r\nthis. But tomorrow is a new day will be. Past was is today. What now is\r\nwill then morrow as now was be past yester.\r\n\r\nVIRAG: (Prompts in a pig\xe2\x80\x99s whisper.) Insects of the day spend their\r\nbrief existence in reiterated coition, lured by the smell of the\r\ninferiorly pulchritudinous female possessing extendified pudendal nerve\r\nin dorsal region. Pretty Poll! (His yellow parrotbeak gabbles nasally.)\r\nThey had a proverb in the Carpathians in or about the year five thousand\r\nfive hundred and fifty of our era. One tablespoonful of honey will\r\nattract friend Bruin more than half a dozen barrels of first choice malt\r\nvinegar. Bear\xe2\x80\x99s buzz bothers bees. But of this apart. At another time we\r\nmay resume. We were very pleased, we others. (He coughs and, bending his\r\nbrow, rubs his nose thoughtfully with a scooping hand.) You shall find\r\nthat these night insects follow the light. An illusion for remember\r\ntheir complex unadjustable eye. For all these knotty points see the\r\nseventeenth book of my Fundamentals of Sexology or the Love Passion\r\nwhich Doctor L. B. says is the book sensation of the year. Some, to\r\nexample, there are again whose movements are automatic. Perceive. That\r\nis his appropriate sun. Nightbird nightsun nighttown. Chase me, Charley!\r\n(He blows into Bloom\xe2\x80\x99s ear.) Buzz!\r\n\r\nBLOOM: Bee or bluebottle too other day butting shadow on wall dazed self\r\nthen me wandered dazed down shirt good job I...\r\n\r\nVIRAG: (His face impassive, laughs in a rich feminine key.) Splendid!\r\nSpanish fly in his fly or mustard plaster on his dibble. (He gobbles\r\ngluttonously with turkey wattles.) Bubbly jock! Bubbly jock! Where are\r\nwe? Open Sesame! Cometh forth! (He unrolls his parchment rapidly and\r\nreads, his glowworm\xe2\x80\x99s nose running backwards over the letters which he\r\nclaws.) Stay, good friend. I bring thee thy answer. Redbank oysters will\r\nshortly be upon us. I\xe2\x80\x99m the best o\xe2\x80\x99cook. Those succulent bivalves may\r\nhelp us and the truffles of Perigord, tubers dislodged through mister\r\nomnivorous porker, were unsurpassed in cases of nervous debility or\r\nviragitis. Though they stink yet they sting. (He wags his head with\r\ncackling raillery.) Jocular. With my eyeglass in my ocular. (He\r\nsneezes.) Amen!\r\n\r\nBLOOM: (Absently.) Ocularly woman\xe2\x80\x99s bivalve case is worse. Always open\r\nsesame. The cloven sex. Why they fear vermin, creeping things. Yet Eve\r\nand the serpent contradicts. Not a historical fact. Obvious analogy\r\nto my idea. Serpents too are gluttons for woman\xe2\x80\x99s milk. Wind their way\r\nthrough miles of omnivorous forest to sucksucculent her breast dry. Like\r\nthose bubblyjocular Roman matrons one reads of in Elephantuliasis.\r\n\r\nVIRAG: (His mouth projected in hard wrinkles, eyes stonily forlornly\r\nclosed, psalms in outlandish monotone.) That the cows with their those\r\ndistended udders that they have been the the known...\r\n\r\nBLOOM: I am going to scream. I beg your pardon. Ah? So. (He repeats.)\r\nSpontaneously to seek out the saurian\xe2\x80\x99s lair in order to entrust their\r\nteats to his avid suction. Ant milks aphis. (Profoundly.) Instinct rules\r\nthe world. In life. In death.\r\n\r\nVIRAG: (Head askew, arches his back and hunched wingshoulders, peers\r\nat the moth out of blear bulged eyes, points a horning claw and cries.)\r\nWho\xe2\x80\x99s moth moth? Who\xe2\x80\x99s dear Gerald? Dear Ger, that you? O dear, he is\r\nGerald. O, I much fear he shall be most badly burned. Will some pleashe\r\npershon not now impediment so catastrophics mit agitation of firstclass\r\ntablenumpkin? (He mews.) Puss puss puss puss! (He sighs, draws back and\r\nstares sideways down with dropping underjaw.) Well, well. He doth rest\r\nanon. (He snaps his jaws suddenly on the air.)\r\n\r\nTHE MOTH:\r\n\r\n     I\xe2\x80\x99m a tiny tiny thing\r\n     Ever flying in the spring\r\n     Round and round a ringaring.\r\n     Long ago I was a king\r\n     Now I do this kind of thing\r\n     On the wing, on the wing!\r\n     Bing!\r\n\r\n(He rushes against the mauve shade, flapping noisily.) Pretty pretty\r\npretty pretty pretty pretty petticoats.\r\n\r\n(From left upper entrance with two gliding steps Henry Flower comes\r\nforward to left front centre. He wears a dark mantle and drooping plumed\r\nsombrero. He carries a silverstringed inlaid dulcimer and a longstemmed\r\nbamboo Jacob\xe2\x80\x99s pipe, its clay bowl fashioned as a female head. He wears\r\ndark velvet hose and silverbuckled pumps. He has the romantic Saviour\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nface with flowing locks, thin beard and moustache. His spindlelegs and\r\nsparrow feet are those of the tenor Mario, prince of Candia. He settles\r\ndown his goffered ruffs and moistens his lips with a passage of his\r\namorous tongue.)\r\n\r\nHENRY: (In a low dulcet voice, touching the strings of his guitar.)\r\nThere is a flower that bloometh.\r\n\r\n(Virag truculent, his jowl set, stares at the lamp. Grave Bloom regards\r\nZoe\xe2\x80\x99s neck. Henry gallant turns with pendant dewlap to the piano.)\r\n\r\nSTEPHEN: (To himself.) Play with your eyes shut. Imitate pa. Filling my\r\nbelly with husks of swine. Too much of this. I will arise and go to my.\r\nExpect this is the. Steve, thou art in a parlous way. Must visit old\r\nDeasy or telegraph.

Minor chord comes now.\r\nYes. Not much however.\r\n\r\n(Almidano Artifoni holds out a batonroll of music with vigorous\r\nmoustachework.)\r\n\r\nARTIFONI: Ci rifletta. Lei rovina tutto.\r\n\r\nFLORRY: Sing us something. Love\xe2\x80\x99s old sweet song.\r\n\r\nSTEPHEN: No voice. I am a most finished artist. Lynch, did I show you\r\nthe letter about the lute?\r\n\r\nFLORRY: (Smirking.) The bird that can sing and won\xe2\x80\x99t sing.\r\n\r\n(The Siamese twins, Philip Drunk and Philip Sober, two Oxford dons with\r\nlawnmowers, appear in the window embrasure. Both are masked with Matthew\r\nArnold\xe2\x80\x99s face.)\r\n\r\nPHILIP SOBER: Take a fool\xe2\x80\x99s advice. All is not well. Work it out with\r\nthe buttend of a pencil, like a good young idiot.

When was it not\r\nAtkinson his card I have somewhere. Mac Somebody. Unmack I have it. He\r\ntold me about, hold on, Swinburne, was it, no?\r\n\r\nFLORRY: And the song?\r\n\r\nSTEPHEN: Spirit is willing but the flesh is weak.\r\n\r\nFLORRY: Are you out of Maynooth? You\xe2\x80\x99re like someone I knew once.\r\n\r\nSTEPHEN: Out of it now. (To himself.) Clever.\r\n\r\nPHILIP DRUNK AND PHILIP SOBER: (Their lawnmowers purring with a rigadoon\r\nof grasshalms.) Clever ever. Out of it out of it. By the bye have\r\nyou the book, the thing, the ashplant? Yes, there it, yes. Cleverever\r\noutofitnow. Keep in condition. Do like us.\r\n\r\nZOE: There was a priest down here two nights ago to do his bit of\r\nbusiness with his coat buttoned up. You needn\xe2\x80\x99t try to hide, I says to\r\nhim. I know you\xe2\x80\x99ve a Roman collar.\r\n\r\nVIRAG: Perfectly logical from his standpoint. Fall of man. (Harshly, his\r\npupils waxing.) To hell with the pope! Nothing new under the sun. I am\r\nthe Virag who disclosed the Sex Secrets of Monks and Maidens. Why I left\r\nthe church of Rome. Read the Priest, the Woman and the Confessional.\r\nPenrose. Flipperty Jippert. (He wriggles.) Woman, undoing with sweet\r\npudor her belt of rushrope, offers her allmoist yoni to man\xe2\x80\x99s lingam.\r\nShort time after man presents woman with pieces of jungle meat. Woman\r\nshows joy and covers herself with featherskins. Man loves her yoni\r\nfiercely with big lingam, the stiff one. (He cries.) Coactus volui.\r\nThen giddy woman will run about. Strong man grapses woman\xe2\x80\x99s wrist.\r\nWoman squeals, bites, spucks. Man, now fierce angry, strikes woman\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nfat yadgana. (He chases his tail.) Piffpaff! Popo! (He stops, sneezes.)\r\nPchp! (He worries his butt.) Prrrrrht!\r\n\r\nLYNCH: I hope you gave the good father a penance. Nine glorias for\r\nshooting a bishop.\r\n\r\nZOE: (Spouts walrus smoke through her nostrils.) He couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get a\r\nconnection. Only, you know, sensation. A dry rush.\r\n\r\nBLOOM: Poor man!\r\n\r\nZOE: (Lightly.) Only for what happened him.\r\n\r\nBLOOM: How?\r\n\r\nVIRAG: (A diabolic rictus of black luminosity contracting his visage,\r\ncranes his scraggy neck forward. He lifts a mooncalf nozzle and howls.)\r\nVerfluchte Goim! He had a father, forty fathers. He never existed. Pig\r\nGod! He had two left feet. He was Judas Iacchia, a Libyan eunuch, the\r\npope\xe2\x80\x99s bastard. (He leans out on tortured forepaws, elbows bent rigid,\r\nhis eye agonising in his flat skullneck and yelps over the mute world.)\r\nA son of a whore. Apocalypse.\r\n\r\nKITTY: And Mary Shortall that was in the lock with the pox she got from\r\nJimmy Pidgeon in the blue caps had a child off him that couldn\xe2\x80\x99t swallow\r\nand was smothered with the convulsions in the mattress and we all\r\nsubscribed for the funeral.\r\n\r\nPHILIP DRUNK: (Gravely.) Qui vous a mis dans cette fichue position,\r\nPhilippe?\r\n\r\nPHILIP SOBER: (Gaily.) C\xe2\x80\x99\xc3\xa9tait le sacr\xc3\xa9 pigeon, Philippe.\r\n\r\n(Kitty unpins her hat and sets it down calmly, patting her henna hair.\r\nAnd a prettier, a daintier head of winsome curls was never seen on a\r\nwhore\xe2\x80\x99s shoulders. Lynch puts on her hat. She whips it off.)\r\n\r\nLYNCH: (Laughs.) And to such delights has Metchnikoff inoculated\r\nanthropoid apes.\r\n\r\nFLORRY: (Nods.) Locomotor ataxy.\r\n\r\nZOE: (Gaily.) O, my dictionary.\r\n\r\nLYNCH: Three wise virgins.\r\n\r\nVIRAG: (Agueshaken, profuse yellow spawn foaming over his bony epileptic\r\nlips.) She sold lovephiltres, whitewax, orangeflower. Panther, the Roman\r\ncenturion, polluted her with his genitories. (He sticks out a flickering\r\nphosphorescent scorpion tongue, his hand on his fork.) Messiah! He burst\r\nher tympanum. (With gibbering baboon\xe2\x80\x99s cries he jerks his hips in the\r\ncynical spasm.) Hik! Hek! Hak! Hok! Huk! Kok! Kuk!\r\n\r\n(Ben Jumbo Dollard, rubicund, musclebound, hairynostrilled, hugebearded,\r\ncabbageeared, shaggychested, shockmaned, fatpapped, stands forth, his\r\nloins and genitals tightened into a pair of black bathing bagslops.)\r\n\r\nBEN DOLLARD: (Nakkering castanet bones in his huge padded paws, yodels\r\njovially in base barreltone.) When love absorbs my ardent soul.\r\n\r\n(The virgins Nurse Callan and Nurse Quigley burst through the\r\nringkeepers and the ropes and mob him with open arms.)\r\n\r\nTHE VIRGINS: (Gushingly.) Big Ben! Ben my Chree!\r\n\r\nA VOICE: Hold that fellow with the bad breeches.\r\n\r\nBEN DOLLARD: (Smites his thigh in abundant laughter.) Hold him now.\r\n\r\nHENRY: (Caressing on his breast a severed female head, murmurs.) Thine\r\nheart, mine love. (He plucks his lutestrings.) When first I saw...\r\n\r\nVIRAG: (Sloughing his skins, his multitudinous plumage moulting.) Rats!\r\n(He yawns, showing a coalblack throat, and closes his jaws by an upward\r\npush of his parchmentroll.) After having said which I took my departure.\r\nFarewell. Fare thee well. Dreck!\r\n\r\n(Henry Flower combs his moustache and beard rapidly with a pocketcomb\r\nand gives a cow\xe2\x80\x99s lick to his hair. Steered by his rapier, he glides to\r\nthe door, his wild harp slung behind him. Virag reaches the door in two\r\nungainly stilthops, his tail cocked, and deftly claps sideways on the\r\nwall a pusyellow flybill, butting it with his head.)\r\n\r\nTHE FLYBILL: K. 11. Post No Bills. Strictly confidential. Dr Hy Franks.\r\n\r\nHENRY: All is lost now.\r\n\r\n(Virag unscrews his head in a trice and holds it under his arm.)\r\n\r\nVIRAG\xe2\x80\x99S HEAD: Quack!\r\n\r\n(Exeunt severally.)\r\n\r\nSTEPHEN: (Over his shoulder to Zoe.) You would have preferred\r\nthe fighting parson who founded the protestant error. But beware\r\nAntisthenes, the dog sage, and the last end of Arius Heresiarchus. The\r\nagony in the closet.\r\n\r\nLYNCH: All one and the same God to her.\r\n\r\nSTEPHEN: (Devoutly.) And sovereign Lord of all things.\r\n\r\nFLORRY: (To Stephen.) I\xe2\x80\x99m sure you\xe2\x80\x99re a spoiled priest. Or a monk.\r\n\r\nLYNCH: He is. A cardinal\xe2\x80\x99s son.\r\n\r\nSTEPHEN: Cardinal sin. Monks of the screw.\r\n\r\n(His Eminence Simon Stephen Cardinal Dedalus, Primate of all Ireland,\r\nappears in the doorway, dressed in red soutane, sandals and socks. Seven\r\ndwarf simian acolytes, also in red, cardinal sins, uphold his train,\r\npeeping under it. He wears a battered silk hat sideways on his head. His\r\nthumbs are stuck in his armpits and his palms outspread. Round his\r\nneck hangs a rosary of corks ending on his breast in a corkscrew cross.\r\nReleasing his thumbs, he invokes grace from on high with large wave\r\ngestures and proclaims with bloated pomp:)\r\n\r\nTHE CARDINAL:\r\n\r\n     Conservio lies captured\r\n     He lies in the lowest dungeon\r\n     With manacles and chains around his limbs\r\n     Weighing upwards of three tons.\r\n\r\n(He looks at all for a moment, his right eye closed tight, his left\r\ncheek puffed out. Then, unable to repress his merriment, he rocks to and\r\nfro, arms akimbo, and sings with broad rollicking humour:)\r\n\r\n     O, the poor little fellow\r\n     Hihihihihis legs they were yellow\r\n     He was plump, fat and heavy and brisk as a snake\r\n     But some bloody savage\r\n     To graize his white cabbage\r\n     He murdered Nell Flaherty\xe2\x80\x99s duckloving drake.\r\n\r\n(A multitude of midges swarms white over his robe. He scratches himself\r\nwith crossed arms at his ribs, grimacing, and exclaims:)\r\n\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m suffering the agony of the damned. By the hoky fiddle, thanks be to\r\nJesus those funny little chaps are not unanimous. If they were they\xe2\x80\x99d\r\nwalk me off the face of the bloody globe.\r\n\r\n(His head aslant he blesses curtly with fore and middle fingers, imparts\r\nthe Easter kiss and doubleshuffles off comically, swaying his hat from\r\nside to side, shrinking quickly to the size of his trainbearers. The\r\ndwarf acolytes, giggling, peeping, nudging, ogling, Easterkissing,\r\nzigzag behind him. His voice is heard mellow from afar, merciful male,\r\nmelodious:)\r\n\r\n     Shall carry my heart to thee,\r\n     Shall carry my heart to thee,\r\n     And the breath of the balmy night\r\n     Shall carry my heart to thee!\r\n\r\n(The trick doorhandle turns.)\r\n\r\nTHE DOORHANDLE: Theeee!\r\n\r\nZOE: The devil is in that door.\r\n\r\n(A male form passes down the creaking staircase and is heard taking the\r\nwaterproof and hat from the rack. Bloom starts forward involuntarily\r\nand, half closing the door as he passes, takes the chocolate from his\r\npocket and offers it nervously to Zoe.)\r\n\r\nZOE: (Sniffs his hair briskly.) Hmmm! Thank your mother for the rabbits.\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m very fond of what I like.\r\n\r\nBLOOM: (Hearing a male voice in talk with the whores on the doorstep,\r\npricks his ears.) If it were he? After? Or because not? Or the double\r\nevent?\r\n\r\nZOE: (Tears open the silverfoil.) Fingers was made before forks. (She\r\nbreaks off and nibbles a piece, gives a piece to Kitty Ricketts and then\r\nturns kittenishly to Lynch.) No objection to French lozenges? (He nods.\r\nShe taunts him.) Have it now or wait till you get it? (He opens his\r\nmouth, his head cocked. She whirls the prize in left circle. His head\r\nfollows. She whirls it back in right circle. He eyes her.) Catch!\r\n\r\n(She tosses a piece. With an adroit snap he catches it and bites it\r\nthrough with a crack.)\r\n\r\nKITTY: (Chewing.) The engineer I was with at the bazaar does have lovely\r\nones. Full of the best liqueurs. And the viceroy was there with his\r\nlady. The gas we had on the Toft\xe2\x80\x99s hobbyhorses. I\xe2\x80\x99m giddy still.\r\n\r\nBLOOM: (In Svengali\xe2\x80\x99s fur overcoat, with folded arms and Napoleonic\r\nforelock, frowns in ventriloquial exorcism with piercing eagle glance\r\ntowards the door. Then rigid with left foot advanced he makes a swift\r\npass with impelling fingers and gives the sign of past master, drawing\r\nhis right arm downwards from his left shoulder.) Go, go, go, I conjure\r\nyou, whoever you are!\r\n\r\n(A male cough and tread are heard passing through the mist outside.\r\nBloom\xe2\x80\x99s features relax. He places a hand in his waistcoat, posing\r\ncalmly. Zoe offers him chocolate.)\r\n\r\nBLOOM: (Solemnly.) Thanks.\r\n\r\nZOE: Do as you\xe2\x80\x99re bid. Here!\r\n\r\n(A firm heelclacking tread is heard on the stairs.)\r\n\r\nBLOOM: (Takes the chocolate.) Aphrodisiac? Tansy and pennyroyal. But I\r\nbought it. Vanilla calms or? Mnemo. Confused light confuses memory. Red\r\ninfluences lupus. Colours affect women\xe2\x80\x99s characters, any they have. This\r\nblack makes me sad. Eat and be merry for tomorrow. (He eats.) Influence\r\ntaste too, mauve. But it is so long since I. Seems new. Aphro. That\r\npriest. Must come. Better late than never. Try truffles at Andrews.\r\n\r\n(The door opens. Bella Cohen, a massive whoremistress, enters. She\r\nis dressed in a threequarter ivory gown, fringed round the hem with\r\ntasselled selvedge, and cools herself flirting a black horn fan like\r\nMinnie Hauck in Carmen. On her left hand are wedding and keeper rings.\r\nHer eyes are deeply carboned. She has a sprouting moustache. Her\r\nolive face is heavy, slightly sweated and fullnosed with orangetainted\r\nnostrils. She has large pendant beryl eardrops.)\r\n\r\nBELLA: My word! I\xe2\x80\x99m all of a mucksweat.\r\n\r\n(She glances round her at the couples. Then her eyes rest on Bloom with\r\nhard insistence. Her large fan winnows wind towards her heated faceneck\r\nand embonpoint. Her falcon eyes glitter.)\r\n\r\nTHE FAN: (Flirting quickly, then slowly.) Married, I see.\r\n\r\nBLOOM: Yes. Partly, I have mislaid...\r\n\r\nTHE FAN: (Half opening, then closing.) And the missus is master.\r\nPetticoat government.\r\n\r\nBLOOM: (Looks down with a sheepish grin.) That is so.\r\n\r\nTHE FAN: (Folding together, rests against her left eardrop.) Have you\r\nforgotten me?\r\n\r\nBLOOM: Nes. Yo.\r\n\r\nTHE FAN: (Folded akimbo against her waist.) Is me her was you dreamed\r\nbefore? Was then she him you us since knew? Am all them and the same now\r\nwe?\r\n\r\n(Bella approaches, gently tapping with the fan.)\r\n\r\nBLOOM: (Wincing.) Powerful being. In my eyes read that slumber which\r\nwomen love.\r\n\r\nTHE FAN: (Tapping.) We have met. You are mine. It is fate.\r\n\r\nBLOOM: (Cowed.) Exuberant female. Enormously I desiderate your\r\ndomination. I am exhausted, abandoned, no more young. I stand, so to\r\nspeak, with an unposted letter bearing the extra regulation fee before\r\nthe too late box of the general postoffice of human life. The door\r\nand window open at a right angle cause a draught of thirtytwo feet per\r\nsecond according to the law of falling bodies. I have felt this instant\r\na twinge of sciatica in my left glutear muscle. It runs in our family.\r\nPoor dear papa, a widower, was a regular barometer from it. He believed\r\nin animal heat. A skin of tabby lined his winter waistcoat. Near the\r\nend, remembering king David and the Sunamite, he shared his bed with\r\nAthos, faithful after death. A dog\xe2\x80\x99s spittle as you probably... (He\r\nwinces.) Ah!\r\n\r\nRICHIE GOULDING: (Bagweighted, passes the door.) Mocking is catch. Best\r\nvalue in Dub. Fit for a prince\xe2\x80\x99s. Liver and kidney.\r\n\r\nTHE FAN: (Tapping.) All things end. Be mine. Now.\r\n\r\nBLOOM: (Undecided.) All now? I should not have parted with my talisman.\r\nRain, exposure at dewfall on the searocks, a peccadillo at my time of\r\nlife. Every phenomenon has a natural cause.\r\n\r\nTHE FAN: (Points downwards slowly.) You may.\r\n\r\nBLOOM: (Looks downwards and perceives her unfastened bootlace.) We are\r\nobserved.\r\n\r\nTHE FAN: (Points downwards quickly.) You must.\r\n\r\nBLOOM: (With desire, with reluctance.) I can make a true black knot.\r\nLearned when I served my time and worked the mail order line for\r\nKellett\xe2\x80\x99s. Experienced hand. Every knot says a lot. Let me. In courtesy.\r\nI knelt once before today. Ah!\r\n\r\n(Bella raises her gown slightly and, steadying her pose, lifts to the\r\nedge of a chair a plump buskined hoof and a full pastern, silksocked.\r\nBloom, stifflegged, aging, bends over her hoof and with gentle fingers\r\ndraws out and in her laces.)\r\n\r\nBLOOM: (Murmurs lovingly.) To be a shoefitter in Manfield\xe2\x80\x99s was my\r\nlove\xe2\x80\x99s young dream, the darling joys of sweet buttonhooking, to lace\r\nup crisscrossed to kneelength the dressy kid footwear satinlined, so\r\nincredibly impossibly small, of Clyde Road ladies. Even their wax model\r\nRaymonde I visited daily to admire her cobweb hose and stick of rhubarb\r\ntoe, as worn in Paris.\r\n\r\nTHE HOOF: Smell my hot goathide. Feel my royal weight.\r\n\r\nBLOOM: (Crosslacing.) Too tight?\r\n\r\nTHE HOOF: If you bungle, Handy Andy, I\xe2\x80\x99ll kick your football for you.\r\n\r\nBLOOM: Not to lace the wrong eyelet as I did the night of the bazaar\r\ndance. Bad luck. Hook in wrong tache of her... person you mentioned.\r\nThat night she met... Now!\r\n\r\n(He knots the lace. Bella places her foot on the floor. Bloom raises\r\nhis head. Her heavy face, her eyes strike him in midbrow. His eyes grow\r\ndull, darker and pouched, his nose thickens.)\r\n\r\nBLOOM: (Mumbles.) Awaiting your further orders we remain, gentlemen,...\r\n\r\nBELLO: (With a hard basilisk stare, in a baritone voice.) Hound of\r\ndishonour!\r\n\r\nBLOOM: (Infatuated.) Empress!\r\n\r\nBELLO: (His heavy cheekchops sagging.) Adorer of the adulterous rump!\r\n\r\nBLOOM: (Plaintively.) Hugeness!\r\n\r\nBELLO: Dungdevourer!\r\n\r\nBLOOM: (With sinews semiflexed.) Magmagnificence!\r\n\r\nBELLO: Down! (He taps her on the shoulder with his fan.) Incline feet\r\nforward! Slide left foot one pace back! You will fall. You are falling.\r\nOn the hands down!\r\n\r\nBLOOM: (Her eyes upturned in the sign of admiration, closing, yaps.)\r\nTruffles!\r\n\r\n(With a piercing epileptic cry she sinks on all fours, grunting,\r\nsnuffling, rooting at his feet: then lies, shamming dead, with eyes shut\r\ntight, trembling eyelids, bowed upon the ground in the attitude of most\r\nexcellent master.)\r\n\r\nBELLO: (With bobbed hair, purple gills, fat moustache rings round his\r\nshaven mouth, in mountaineer\xe2\x80\x99s puttees, green silverbuttoned coat, sport\r\nskirt and alpine hat with moorcock\xe2\x80\x99s feather, his hands stuck deep in\r\nhis breeches pockets, places his heel on her neck and grinds it in.)\r\nFootstool! Feel my entire weight. Bow, bondslave, before the throne of\r\nyour despot\xe2\x80\x99s glorious heels so glistening in their proud erectness.\r\n\r\nBLOOM: (Enthralled, bleats.) I promise never to disobey.\r\n\r\nBELLO: (Laughs loudly.) Holy smoke! You little know what\xe2\x80\x99s in store for\r\nyou. I\xe2\x80\x99m the Tartar to settle your little lot and break you in! I\xe2\x80\x99ll bet\r\nKentucky cocktails all round I shame it out of you, old son. Cheek me,\r\nI dare you. If you do tremble in anticipation of heel discipline to be\r\ninflicted in gym costume.\r\n\r\n(Bloom creeps under the sofa and peers out through the fringe.)\r\n\r\nZOE: (Widening her slip to screen her.) She\xe2\x80\x99s not here.\r\n\r\nBLOOM: (Closing her eyes.) She\xe2\x80\x99s not here.\r\n\r\nFLORRY: (Hiding her with her gown.) She didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean it, Mr Bello. She\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nbe good, sir.\r\n\r\nKITTY: Don\xe2\x80\x99t be too hard on her, Mr Bello. Sure you won\xe2\x80\x99t, ma\xe2\x80\x99amsir.\r\n\r\nBELLO: (Coaxingly.) Come, ducky dear, I want a word with you, darling,\r\njust to administer correction. Just a little heart to heart talk,\r\nsweety. (Bloom puts out her timid head.) There\xe2\x80\x99s a good girly now.\r\n(Bello grabs her hair violently and drags her forward.) I only want to\r\ncorrect you for your own good on a soft safe spot. How\xe2\x80\x99s that tender\r\nbehind? O, ever so gently, pet. Begin to get ready.\r\n\r\nBLOOM: (Fainting.) Don\xe2\x80\x99t tear my...\r\n\r\nBELLO: (Savagely.) The nosering, the pliers, the bastinado, the hanging\r\nhook, the knout I\xe2\x80\x99ll make you kiss while the flutes play like the Nubian\r\nslave of old. You\xe2\x80\x99re in for it this time! I\xe2\x80\x99ll make you remember me for\r\nthe balance of your natural life. (His forehead veins swollen, his face\r\ncongested.) I shall sit on your ottoman saddleback every morning after\r\nmy thumping good breakfast of Matterson\xe2\x80\x99s fat hamrashers and a bottle\r\nof Guinness\xe2\x80\x99s porter. (He belches.) And suck my thumping good Stock\r\nExchange cigar while I read the Licensed Victualler\xe2\x80\x99s Gazette. Very\r\npossibly I shall have you slaughtered and skewered in my stables and\r\nenjoy a slice of you with crisp crackling from the baking tin basted\r\nand baked like sucking pig with rice and lemon or currant sauce. It will\r\nhurt you. (He twists her arm. Bloom squeals, turning turtle.)\r\n\r\nBLOOM: Don\xe2\x80\x99t be cruel, nurse! Don\xe2\x80\x99t!\r\n\r\nBELLO: (Twisting.) Another!\r\n\r\nBLOOM: (Screams.) O, it\xe2\x80\x99s hell itself! Every nerve in my body aches like\r\nmad!\r\n\r\nBELLO: (Shouts.) Good, by the rumping jumping general! That\xe2\x80\x99s the best\r\nbit of news I heard these six weeks. Here, don\xe2\x80\x99t keep me waiting, damn\r\nyou! (He slaps her face.)\r\n\r\nBLOOM: (Whimpers.) You\xe2\x80\x99re after hitting me. I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell...\r\n\r\nBELLO: Hold him down, girls, till I squat on him.\r\n\r\nZOE: Yes. Walk on him! I will.\r\n\r\nFLORRY: I will. Don\xe2\x80\x99t be greedy.\r\n\r\nKITTY: No, me. Lend him to me.\r\n\r\n(The brothel cook, Mrs Keogh, wrinkled, greybearded, in a greasy bib,\r\nmen\xe2\x80\x99s grey and green socks and brogues, floursmeared, a rollingpin stuck\r\nwith raw pastry in her bare red arm and hand, appears at the door.)\r\n\r\nMRS KEOGH: (Ferociously.) Can I help? (They hold and pinion Bloom.)\r\n\r\nBELLO: (Squats with a grunt on Bloom\xe2\x80\x99s upturned face, puffing\r\ncigarsmoke, nursing a fat leg.) I see Keating Clay is elected\r\nvicechairman of the Richmond asylum and by the by Guinness\xe2\x80\x99s preference\r\nshares are at sixteen three quarters. Curse me for a fool that didn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nbuy that lot Craig and Gardner told me about. Just my infernal luck,\r\ncurse it. And that Goddamned outsider Throwaway at twenty to one. (He\r\nquenches his cigar angrily on Bloom\xe2\x80\x99s ear.) Where\xe2\x80\x99s that Goddamned\r\ncursed ashtray?\r\n\r\nBLOOM: (Goaded, buttocksmothered.) O! O! Monsters! Cruel one!\r\n\r\nBELLO: Ask for that every ten minutes. Beg. Pray for it as you never\r\nprayed before. (He thrusts out a figged fist and foul cigar.) Here, kiss\r\nthat. Both. Kiss. (He throws a leg astride and, pressing with horseman\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nknees, calls in a hard voice.) Gee up! A cockhorse to Banbury cross.\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll ride him for the Eclipse stakes. (He bends sideways and squeezes\r\nhis mount\xe2\x80\x99s testicles roughly, shouting.) Ho! Off we pop! I\xe2\x80\x99ll nurse\r\nyou in proper fashion. (He horserides cockhorse, leaping in the, in the\r\nsaddle.) The lady goes a pace a pace and the coachman goes a trot a trot\r\nand the gentleman goes a gallop a gallop a gallop a gallop.\r\n\r\nFLORRY: (Pulls at Bello.) Let me on him now. You had enough. I asked\r\nbefore you.\r\n\r\nZOE: (Pulling at Florry.) Me. Me. Are you not finished with him yet,\r\nsuckeress?\r\n\r\nBLOOM: (Stifling.) Can\xe2\x80\x99t.\r\n\r\nBELLO: Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m not. Wait. (He holds in his breath.) Curse it. Here.\r\nThis bung\xe2\x80\x99s about burst. (He uncorks himself behind: then, contorting\r\nhis features, farts loudly.) Take that! (He recorks himself.) Yes, by\r\nJingo, sixteen three quarters.\r\n\r\nBLOOM: (A sweat breaking out over him.) Not man. (He sniffs.) Woman.\r\n\r\nBELLO: (Stands up.) No more blow hot and cold. What you longed for has\r\ncome to pass. Henceforth you are unmanned and mine in earnest, a thing\r\nunder the yoke. Now for your punishment frock. You will shed your male\r\ngarments, you understand, Ruby Cohen? and don the shot silk luxuriously\r\nrustling over head and shoulders. And quickly too!\r\n\r\nBLOOM: (Shrinks.) Silk, mistress said! O crinkly! scrapy! Must I\r\ntiptouch it with my nails?\r\n\r\nBELLO: (Points to his whores.) As they are now so will you be, wigged,\r\nsinged, perfumesprayed, ricepowdered, with smoothshaven armpits. Tape\r\nmeasurements will be taken next your skin. You will be laced with cruel\r\nforce into vicelike corsets of soft dove coutille with whalebone busk to\r\nthe diamondtrimmed pelvis, the absolute outside edge, while your figure,\r\nplumper than when at large, will be restrained in nettight frocks,\r\npretty two ounce petticoats and fringes and things stamped, of course,\r\nwith my houseflag, creations of lovely lingerie for Alice and nice\r\nscent for Alice. Alice will feel the pullpull. Martha and Mary will be\r\na little chilly at first in such delicate thighcasing but the frilly\r\nflimsiness of lace round your bare knees will remind you...\r\n\r\nBLOOM: (A charming soubrette with dauby cheeks, mustard hair and large\r\nmale hands and nose, leering mouth.) I tried her things on only twice,\r\na small prank, in Holles street. When we were hard up I washed them to\r\nsave the laundry bill. My own shirts I turned. It was the purest thrift.\r\n\r\nBELLO: (Jeers.) Little jobs that make mother pleased, eh? And showed off\r\ncoquettishly in your domino at the mirror behind closedrawn blinds your\r\nunskirted thighs and hegoat\xe2\x80\x99s udders in various poses of surrender, eh?\r\nHo! ho! I have to laugh! That secondhand black operatop shift and short\r\ntrunkleg naughties all split up the stitches at her last rape that Mrs\r\nMiriam Dandrade sold you from the Shelbourne hotel, eh?\r\n\r\nBLOOM: Miriam. Black. Demimondaine.\r\n\r\nBELLO: (Guffaws.) Christ Almighty it\xe2\x80\x99s too tickling, this! You were\r\na nicelooking Miriam when you clipped off your backgate hairs and\r\nlay swooning in the thing across the bed as Mrs Dandrade about to be\r\nviolated by lieutenant Smythe-Smythe, Mr Philip Augustus Blockwell M.\r\nP., signor Laci Daremo, the robust tenor, blueeyed Bert, the liftboy,\r\nHenri Fleury of Gordon Bennett fame, Sheridan, the quadroon Croesus, the\r\nvarsity wetbob eight from old Trinity, Ponto, her splendid Newfoundland\r\nand Bobs, dowager duchess of Manorhamilton. (He guffaws again.) Christ,\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t it make a Siamese cat laugh?\r\n\r\nBLOOM: (Her hands and features working.) It was Gerald converted me to\r\nbe a true corsetlover when I was female impersonator in the High School\r\nplay Vice Versa. It was dear Gerald. He got that kink, fascinated by\r\nsister\xe2\x80\x99s stays. Now dearest Gerald uses pinky greasepaint and gilds his\r\neyelids. Cult of the beautiful.\r\n\r\nBELLO: (With wicked glee.) Beautiful! Give us a breather! When you took\r\nyour seat with womanish care, lifting your billowy flounces, on the\r\nsmoothworn throne.\r\n\r\nBLOOM: Science. To compare the various joys we each enjoy. (Earnestly.)\r\nAnd really it\xe2\x80\x99s better the position... because often I used to wet...\r\n\r\nBELLO: (Sternly.) No insubordination! The sawdust is there in the corner\r\nfor you. I gave you strict instructions, didn\xe2\x80\x99t I? Do it standing, sir!\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll teach you to behave like a jinkleman! If I catch a trace on your\r\nswaddles. Aha! By the ass of the Dorans you\xe2\x80\x99ll find I\xe2\x80\x99m a martinet. The\r\nsins of your past are rising against you. Many. Hundreds.\r\n\r\nTHE SINS OF THE PAST: (In a medley of voices.) He went through a form of\r\nclandestine marriage with at least one woman in the shadow of the Black\r\nchurch. Unspeakable messages he telephoned mentally to Miss Dunn at an\r\naddress in D\xe2\x80\x99Olier street while he presented himself indecently to the\r\ninstrument in the callbox. By word and deed he frankly encouraged a\r\nnocturnal strumpet to deposit fecal and other matter in an unsanitary\r\nouthouse attached to empty premises. In five public conveniences\r\nhe wrote pencilled messages offering his nuptial partner to all\r\nstrongmembered males. And by the offensively smelling vitriol works did\r\nhe not pass night after night by loving courting couples to see if and\r\nwhat and how much he could see? Did he not lie in bed, the gross boar,\r\ngloating over a nauseous fragment of wellused toilet paper presented to\r\nhim by a nasty harlot, stimulated by gingerbread and a postal order?\r\n\r\nBELLO: (Whistles loudly.) Say! What was the most revolting piece of\r\nobscenity in all your career of crime? Go the whole hog. Puke it out! Be\r\ncandid for once.\r\n\r\n(Mute inhuman faces throng forward, leering, vanishing, gibbering,\r\nBooloohoom. Poldy Kock, Bootlaces a penny, Cassidy\xe2\x80\x99s hag, blind\r\nstripling, Larry Rhinoceros, the girl, the woman, the whore, the other,\r\nthe...)\r\n\r\nBLOOM: Don\xe2\x80\x99t ask me! Our mutual faith. Pleasants street. I only thought\r\nthe half of the... I swear on my sacred oath...\r\n\r\nBELLO: (Peremptorily.) Answer. Repugnant wretch! I insist on knowing.\r\nTell me something to amuse me, smut or a bloody good ghoststory or a\r\nline of poetry, quick, quick, quick! Where? How? What time? With how\r\nmany? I give you just three seconds. One! Two! Thr...\r\n\r\nBLOOM: (Docile, gurgles.) I rererepugnosed in rerererepugnant...\r\n\r\nBELLO: (Imperiously.) O, get out, you skunk! Hold your tongue! Speak\r\nwhen you\xe2\x80\x99re spoken to.\r\n\r\nBLOOM: (Bows.) Master! Mistress! Mantamer!\r\n\r\n(He lifts his arms. His bangle bracelets fall.)\r\n\r\nBELLO: (Satirically.) By day you will souse and bat our smelling\r\nunderclothes also when we ladies are unwell, and swab out our latrines\r\nwith dress pinned up and a dishclout tied to your tail. Won\xe2\x80\x99t that be\r\nnice? (He places a ruby ring on her finger.) And there now! With this\r\nring I thee own. Say, thank you, mistress.\r\n\r\nBLOOM: Thank you, mistress.\r\n\r\nBELLO: You will make the beds, get my tub ready, empty the pisspots in\r\nthe different rooms, including old Mrs Keogh\xe2\x80\x99s the cook\xe2\x80\x99s, a sandy one.\r\nAy, and rinse the seven of them well, mind, or lap it up like champagne.\r\nDrink me piping hot. Hop! You will dance attendance or I\xe2\x80\x99ll lecture you\r\non your misdeeds, Miss Ruby, and spank your bare bot right well, miss,\r\nwith the hairbrush. You\xe2\x80\x99ll be taught the error of your ways. At night\r\nyour wellcreamed braceletted hands will wear fortythreebutton gloves\r\nnewpowdered with talc and having delicately scented fingertips. For such\r\nfavours knights of old laid down their lives. (He chuckles.) My boys\r\nwill be no end charmed to see you so ladylike, the colonel, above\r\nall, when they come here the night before the wedding to fondle my new\r\nattraction in gilded heels. First I\xe2\x80\x99ll have a go at you myself. A man I\r\nknow on the turf named Charles Alberta Marsh (I was in bed with him just\r\nnow and another gentleman out of the Hanaper and Petty Bag office) is\r\non the lookout for a maid of all work at a short knock. Swell the bust.\r\nSmile. Droop shoulders. What offers? (He points.) For that lot. Trained\r\nby owner to fetch and carry, basket in mouth. (He bares his arm and\r\nplunges it elbowdeep in Bloom\xe2\x80\x99s vulva.) There\xe2\x80\x99s fine depth for you!\r\nWhat, boys? That give you a hardon? (He shoves his arm in a bidder\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nface.) Here wet the deck and wipe it round!\r\n\r\nA BIDDER: A florin.\r\n\r\n(Dillon\xe2\x80\x99s lacquey rings his handbell.)\r\n\r\nTHE LACQUEY: Barang!\r\n\r\nA VOICE: One and eightpence too much.\r\n\r\nCHARLES ALBERTA MARSH: Must be virgin. Good breath. Clean.\r\n\r\nBELLO: (Gives a rap with his gavel.) Two bar. Rockbottom figure and\r\ncheap at the price. Fourteen hands high. Touch and examine shis points.\r\nHandle hrim. This downy skin, these soft muscles, this tender flesh. If\r\nI had only my gold piercer here! And quite easy to milk. Three newlaid\r\ngallons a day. A pure stockgetter, due to lay within the hour. His\r\nsire\xe2\x80\x99s milk record was a thousand gallons of whole milk in forty weeks.\r\nWhoa, my jewel! Beg up! Whoa! (He brands his initial C on Bloom\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncroup.) So! Warranted Cohen! What advance on two bob, gentlemen?\r\n\r\nA DARKVISAGED MAN: (In disguised accent.) Hoondert punt sterlink.\r\n\r\nVOICES: (Subdued.) For the Caliph. Haroun Al Raschid.\r\n\r\nBELLO: (Gaily.) Right. Let them all come. The scanty, daringly short\r\nskirt, riding up at the knee to show a peep of white pantalette, is a\r\npotent weapon and transparent stockings, emeraldgartered, with the\r\nlong straight seam trailing up beyond the knee, appeal to the better\r\ninstincts of the blas\xc3\xa9 man about town. Learn the smooth mincing walk on\r\nfour inch Louis Quinze heels, the Grecian bend with provoking croup,\r\nthe thighs fluescent, knees modestly kissing. Bring all your powers of\r\nfascination to bear on them. Pander to their Gomorrahan vices.\r\n\r\nBLOOM: (Bends his blushing face into his armpit and simpers with\r\nforefinger in mouth.) O, I know what you\xe2\x80\x99re hinting at now!\r\n\r\nBELLO: What else are you good for, an impotent thing like you? (He\r\nstoops and, peering, pokes with his fan rudely under the fat suet folds\r\nof Bloom\xe2\x80\x99s haunches.) Up! Up! Manx cat! What have we here? Where\xe2\x80\x99s your\r\ncurly teapot gone to or who docked it on you, cockyolly? Sing, birdy,\r\nsing. It\xe2\x80\x99s as limp as a boy of six\xe2\x80\x99s doing his pooly behind a cart. Buy\r\na bucket or sell your pump. (Loudly.) Can you do a man\xe2\x80\x99s job?\r\n\r\nBLOOM: Eccles street...\r\n\r\nBELLO: (Sarcastically.) I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t hurt your feelings for the world but\r\nthere\xe2\x80\x99s a man of brawn in possession there. The tables are turned, my\r\ngay young fellow! He is something like a fullgrown outdoor man. Well for\r\nyou, you muff, if you had that weapon with knobs and lumps and warts all\r\nover it. He shot his bolt, I can tell you! Foot to foot, knee to knee,\r\nbelly to belly, bubs to breast! He\xe2\x80\x99s no eunuch. A shock of red hair he\r\nhas sticking out of him behind like a furzebush! Wait for nine months,\r\nmy lad! Holy ginger, it\xe2\x80\x99s kicking and coughing up and down in her guts\r\nalready! That makes you wild, don\xe2\x80\x99t it? Touches the spot? (He spits in\r\ncontempt.) Spittoon!\r\n\r\nBLOOM: I was indecently treated, I... Inform the police. Hundred pounds.\r\nUnmentionable. I...\r\n\r\nBELLO: Would if you could, lame duck. A downpour we want not your\r\ndrizzle.\r\n\r\nBLOOM: To drive me mad! Moll! I forgot! Forgive! Moll... We... Still...\r\n\r\nBELLO: (Ruthlessly.) No, Leopold Bloom, all is changed by woman\xe2\x80\x99s will\r\nsince you slept horizontal in Sleepy Hollow your night of twenty years.\r\nReturn and see.\r\n\r\n(Old Sleepy Hollow calls over the wold.)\r\n\r\nSLEEPY HOLLOW: Rip van Wink! Rip van Winkle!\r\n\r\nBLOOM: (In tattered mocassins with a rusty fowlingpiece, tiptoeing,\r\nfingertipping, his haggard bony bearded face peering through the diamond\r\npanes, cries out.) I see her! It\xe2\x80\x99s she! The first night at Mat Dillon\xe2\x80\x99s!\r\nBut that dress, the green! And her hair is dyed gold and he...\r\n\r\nBELLO: (Laughs mockingly.) That\xe2\x80\x99s your daughter, you owl, with a\r\nMullingar student.\r\n\r\n(Milly Bloom, fairhaired, greenvested, slimsandalled, her blue scarf\r\nin the seawind simply swirling, breaks from the arms of her lover and\r\ncalls, her young eyes wonderwide.)\r\n\r\nMILLY: My! It\xe2\x80\x99s Papli! But, O Papli, how old you\xe2\x80\x99ve grown!\r\n\r\nBELLO: Changed, eh? Our whatnot, our writingtable where we never wrote,\r\naunt Hegarty\xe2\x80\x99s armchair, our classic reprints of old masters. A man and\r\nhis menfriends are living there in clover. The Cuckoos\xe2\x80\x99 Rest! Why not?\r\nHow many women had you, eh, following them up dark streets, flatfoot,\r\nexciting them by your smothered grunts, what, you male prostitute?\r\nBlameless dames with parcels of groceries. Turn about. Sauce for the\r\ngoose, my gander O.\r\n\r\nBLOOM: They... I...\r\n\r\nBELLO: (Cuttingly.) Their heelmarks will stamp the Brusselette carpet\r\nyou bought at Wren\xe2\x80\x99s auction. In their horseplay with Moll the romp to\r\nfind the buck flea in her breeches they will deface the little statue\r\nyou carried home in the rain for art for art\xe2\x80\x99s sake. They will violate\r\nthe secrets of your bottom drawer. Pages will be torn from your handbook\r\nof astronomy to make them pipespills. And they will spit in your ten\r\nshilling brass fender from Hampton Leedom\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\nBLOOM: Ten and six. The act of low scoundrels. Let me go. I will return.\r\nI will prove...\r\n\r\nA VOICE: Swear!\r\n\r\n(Bloom clenches his fists and crawls forward, a bowieknife between his\r\nteeth.)\r\n\r\nBELLO: As a paying guest or a kept man? Too late. You have made your\r\nsecondbest bed and others must lie in it. Your epitaph is written. You\r\nare down and out and don\xe2\x80\x99t you forget it, old bean.\r\n\r\nBLOOM: Justice! All Ireland versus one! Has nobody...? (He bites his\r\nthumb.)\r\n\r\nBELLO: Die and be damned to you if you have any sense of decency\r\nor grace about you. I can give you a rare old wine that\xe2\x80\x99ll send you\r\nskipping to hell and back. Sign a will and leave us any coin you have!\r\nIf you have none see you damn well get it, steal it, rob it! We\xe2\x80\x99ll bury\r\nyou in our shrubbery jakes where you\xe2\x80\x99ll be dead and dirty with old Cuck\r\nCohen, my stepnephew I married, the bloody old gouty procurator and\r\nsodomite with a crick in his neck, and my other ten or eleven husbands,\r\nwhatever the buggers\xe2\x80\x99 names were, suffocated in the one cesspool. (He\r\nexplodes in a loud phlegmy laugh.) We\xe2\x80\x99ll manure you, Mr Flower! (He\r\npipes scoffingly.) Byby, Poldy! Byby, Papli!\r\n\r\nBLOOM: (Clasps his head.) My willpower! Memory! I have sinned! I have\r\nsuff...\r\n\r\n(He weeps tearlessly.)\r\n\r\nBELLO: (Sneers.) Crybabby! Crocodile tears!\r\n\r\n(Bloom, broken, closely veiled for the sacrifice, sobs, his face to\r\nthe earth. The passing bell is heard. Darkshawled figures of the\r\ncircumcised, in sackcloth and ashes, stand by the wailing wall. M.\r\nShulomowitz, Joseph Goldwater, Moses Herzog, Harris Rosenberg, M.\r\nMoisel, J. Citron, Minnie Watchman, P. Mastiansky, The Reverend Leopold\r\nAbramovitz, Chazen. With swaying arms they wail in pneuma over the\r\nrecreant Bloom.)\r\n\r\nTHE CIRCUMCISED: (In dark guttural chant as they cast dead sea fruit\r\nupon him, no flowers.) Shema Israel Adonai Elohenu Adonai Echad.\r\n\r\nVOICES: (Sighing.) So he\xe2\x80\x99s gone. Ah yes. Yes, indeed. Bloom? Never heard\r\nof him. No? Queer kind of chap. There\xe2\x80\x99s the widow. That so? Ah, yes.\r\n\r\n(From the suttee pyre the flame of gum camphire ascends. The pall of\r\nincense smoke screens and disperses. Out of her oakframe a nymph with\r\nhair unbound, lightly clad in teabrown artcolours, descends from her\r\ngrotto and passing under interlacing yews stands over Bloom.)\r\n\r\nTHE YEWS: (Their leaves whispering.) Sister. Our sister. Ssh!\r\n\r\nTHE NYMPH: (Softly.) Mortal! (Kindly.) Nay, dost not weepest!\r\n\r\nBLOOM: (Crawls jellily forward under the boughs, streaked by sunlight,\r\nwith dignity.) This position. I felt it was expected of me. Force of\r\nhabit.\r\n\r\nTHE NYMPH: Mortal! You found me in evil company, highkickers, coster\r\npicnicmakers, pugilists, popular generals, immoral panto boys in\r\nfleshtights and the nifty shimmy dancers, La Aurora and Karini, musical\r\nact, the hit of the century. I was hidden in cheap pink paper that smelt\r\nof rock oil. I was surrounded by the stale smut of clubmen, stories to\r\ndisturb callow youth, ads for transparencies, truedup dice and bustpads,\r\nproprietary articles and why wear a truss with testimonial from ruptured\r\ngentleman. Useful hints to the married.\r\n\r\nBLOOM: (Lifts a turtle head towards her lap.) We have met before. On\r\nanother star.\r\n\r\nTHE NYMPH: (Sadly.) Rubber goods. Neverrip brand as supplied to the\r\naristocracy. Corsets for men. I cure fits or money refunded. Unsolicited\r\ntestimonials for Professor Waldmann\xe2\x80\x99s wonderful chest exuber. My bust\r\ndeveloped four inches in three weeks, reports Mrs Gus Rublin with photo.\r\n\r\nBLOOM: You mean Photo Bits?\r\n\r\nTHE NYMPH: I do. You bore me away, framed me in oak and tinsel, set me\r\nabove your marriage couch. Unseen, one summer eve, you kissed me in\r\nfour places. And with loving pencil you shaded my eyes, my bosom and my\r\nshame.\r\n\r\nBLOOM: (Humbly kisses her long hair.) Your classic curves, beautiful\r\nimmortal, I was glad to look on you, to praise you, a thing of beauty,\r\nalmost to pray.\r\n\r\nTHE NYMPH: During dark nights I heard your praise.\r\n\r\nBLOOM: (Quickly.) Yes, yes. You mean that I... Sleep reveals the worst\r\nside of everyone, children perhaps excepted. I know I fell out of bed\r\nor rather was pushed. Steel wine is said to cure snoring. For the rest\r\nthere is that English invention, pamphlet of which I received some days\r\nago, incorrectly addressed. It claims to afford a noiseless, inoffensive\r\nvent. (He sighs.) \xe2\x80\x98Twas ever thus. Frailty, thy name is marriage.\r\n\r\nTHE NYMPH: (Her fingers in her ears.) And words. They are not in my\r\ndictionary.\r\n\r\nBLOOM: You understood them?\r\n\r\nTHE YEWS: Ssh!\r\n\r\nTHE NYMPH: (Covers her face with her hands.) What have I not seen in\r\nthat chamber? What must my eyes look down on?\r\n\r\nBLOOM: (Apologetically.) I know. Soiled personal linen, wrong side up\r\nwith care. The quoits are loose. From Gibraltar by long sea long ago.\r\n\r\nTHE NYMPH: (Bends her head.) Worse, worse!\r\n\r\nBLOOM: (Reflects precautiously.) That antiquated commode. It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t her\r\nweight. She scaled just eleven stone nine. She put on nine pounds\r\nafter weaning. It was a crack and want of glue. Eh? And that absurd\r\norangekeyed utensil which has only one handle.\r\n\r\n(The sound of a waterfall is heard in bright cascade.)\r\n\r\nTHE WATERFALL:\r\n\r\n     Poulaphouca Poulaphouca\r\n     Poulaphouca Poulaphouca.\r\n\r\nTHE YEWS: (Mingling their boughs.) Listen. Whisper. She is right, our\r\nsister. We grew by Poulaphouca waterfall. We gave shade on languorous\r\nsummer days.\r\n\r\nJOHN WYSE NOLAN: (In the background, in Irish National Forester\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nuniform, doffs his plumed hat.) Prosper! Give shade on languorous days,\r\ntrees of Ireland!\r\n\r\nTHE YEWS: (Murmuring.) Who came to Poulaphouca with the High School\r\nexcursion? Who left his nutquesting classmates to seek our shade?\r\n\r\nBLOOM: (Scared.) High School of Poula? Mnemo? Not in full possession of\r\nfaculties. Concussion. Run over by tram.\r\n\r\nTHE ECHO: Sham!\r\n\r\nBLOOM: (Pigeonbreasted, bottleshouldered, padded, in nondescript\r\njuvenile grey and black striped suit, too small for him, white tennis\r\nshoes, bordered stockings with turnover tops and a red schoolcap with\r\nbadge.) I was in my teens, a growing boy. A little then sufficed, a\r\njolting car, the mingling odours of the ladies\xe2\x80\x99 cloakroom and lavatory,\r\nthe throng penned tight on the old Royal stairs (for they love crushes,\r\ninstinct of the herd, and the dark sexsmelling theatre unbridles\r\nvice), even a pricelist of their hosiery. And then the heat. There were\r\nsunspots that summer. End of school. And tipsycake. Halcyon days.\r\n\r\n(Halcyon days, high school boys in blue and white football jerseys and\r\nshorts, Master Donald Turnbull, Master Abraham Chatterton, Master Owen\r\nGoldberg, Master Jack Meredith, Master Percy Apjohn, stand in a clearing\r\nof the trees and shout to Master Leopold Bloom.)\r\n\r\nTHE HALCYON DAYS: Mackerel! Live us again. Hurray! (They cheer.)\r\n\r\nBLOOM: (Hobbledehoy, warmgloved, mammamufflered, starred with spent\r\nsnowballs, struggles to rise.) Again! I feel sixteen! What a lark! Let\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nring all the bells in Montague street. (He cheers feebly.) Hurray for\r\nthe High School!\r\n\r\nTHE ECHO: Fool!\r\n\r\nTHE YEWS: (Rustling.) She is right, our sister. Whisper. (Whispered\r\nkisses are heard in all the wood. Faces of hamadryads peep out from\r\nthe boles and among the leaves and break, blossoming into bloom.) Who\r\nprofaned our silent shade?\r\n\r\nTHE NYMPH: (Coyly, through parting fingers.) There? In the open air?\r\n\r\nTHE YEWS: (Sweeping downward.) Sister, yes. And on our virgin sward.\r\n\r\nTHE WATERFALL:\r\n\r\n     Poulaphouca Poulaphouca\r\n     Phoucaphouca Phoucaphouca.\r\n\r\nTHE NYMPH: (With wide fingers.) O, infamy!\r\n\r\nBLOOM: I was precocious. Youth. The fauna. I sacrificed to the god of\r\nthe forest. The flowers that bloom in the spring. It was pairing\r\ntime. Capillary attraction is a natural phenomenon. Lotty Clarke,\r\nflaxenhaired, I saw at her night toilette through illclosed curtains\r\nwith poor papa\xe2\x80\x99s operaglasses: The wanton ate grass wildly. She rolled\r\ndownhill at Rialto bridge to tempt me with her flow of animal spirits.\r\nShe climbed their crooked tree and I... A saint couldn\xe2\x80\x99t resist it. The\r\ndemon possessed me. Besides, who saw?\r\n\r\n(Staggering Bob, a whitepolled calf, thrusts a ruminating head with\r\nhumid nostrils through the foliage.)\r\n\r\nSTAGGERING BOB: (Large teardrops rolling from his prominent eyes,\r\nsnivels.) Me. Me see.\r\n\r\nBLOOM: Simply satisfying a need I... (With pathos.) No girl would when I\r\nwent girling. Too ugly. They wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t play...\r\n\r\n(High on Ben Howth through rhododendrons a nannygoat passes,\r\nplumpuddered, buttytailed, dropping currants.)\r\n\r\nTHE NANNYGOAT: (Bleats.) Megeggaggegg! Nannannanny!\r\n\r\nBLOOM: (Hatless, flushed, covered with burrs of thistledown and\r\ngorsespine.) Regularly engaged. Circumstances alter cases. (He gazes\r\nintently downwards on the water.) Thirtytwo head over heels per second.\r\nPress nightmare. Giddy Elijah. Fall from cliff. Sad end of government\r\nprinter\xe2\x80\x99s clerk. (Through silversilent summer air the dummy of Bloom,\r\nrolled in a mummy, rolls roteatingly from the Lion\xe2\x80\x99s Head cliff into the\r\npurple waiting waters.)\r\n\r\nTHE DUMMYMUMMY: Bbbbblllllblblblblobschbg!\r\n\r\n(Far out in the bay between Bailey and Kish lights the Erin\xe2\x80\x99s King\r\nsails, sending a broadening plume of coalsmoke from her funnel towards\r\nthe land.)\r\n\r\nCOUNCILLOR NANNETTI: (Alone on deck, in dark alpaca, yellowkitefaced,\r\nhis hand in his waistcoat opening, declaims.) When my country takes her\r\nplace among the nations of the earth, then, and not till then, let my\r\nepitaph be written. I have...\r\n\r\nBLOOM: Done. Prff!\r\n\r\nTHE NYMPH: (Loftily.) We immortals, as you saw today, have not such\r\na place and no hair there either. We are stonecold and pure. We eat\r\nelectric light. (She arches her body in lascivious crispation, placing\r\nher forefinger in her mouth.) Spoke to me. Heard from behind. How then\r\ncould you...?\r\n\r\nBLOOM: (Pawing the heather abjectly.) O, I have been a perfect pig.\r\nEnemas too I have administered. One third of a pint of quassia to which\r\nadd a tablespoonful of rocksalt. Up the fundament. With Hamilton Long\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsyringe, the ladies\xe2\x80\x99 friend.\r\n\r\nTHE NYMPH: In my presence. The powderpuff. (She blushes and makes a\r\nknee.) And the rest!\r\n\r\nBLOOM: (Dejected.) Yes. Peccavi! I have paid homage on that living altar\r\nwhere the back changes name. (With sudden fervour.) For why should the\r\ndainty scented jewelled hand, the hand that rules...?\r\n\r\n(Figures wind serpenting in slow woodland pattern around the treestems,\r\ncooeeing.)\r\n\r\nTHE VOICE OF KITTY: (In the thicket.) Show us one of them cushions.\r\n\r\nTHE VOICE OF FLORRY: Here.\r\n\r\n(A grouse wings clumsily through the underwood.)\r\n\r\nTHE VOICE OF LYNCH: (In the thicket.) Whew! Piping hot!\r\n\r\nTHE VOICE OF ZOE: (From the thicket.) Came from a hot place.\r\n\r\nTHE VOICE OF VIRAG: (A birdchief, bluestreaked and feathered in war\r\npanoply with his assegai, striding through a crackling canebrake over\r\nbeechmast and acorns.) Hot! Hot! Ware Sitting Bull!\r\n\r\nBLOOM: It overpowers me. The warm impress of her warm form. Even to sit\r\nwhere a woman has sat, especially with divaricated thighs, as though to\r\ngrant the last favours, most especially with previously well uplifted\r\nwhite sateen coatpans. So womanly, full. It fills me full.\r\n\r\nTHE WATERFALL:\r\n\r\n     Phillaphulla Poulaphouca\r\n     Poulaphouca Poulaphouca.\r\n\r\nTHE YEWS: Ssh! Sister, speak!\r\n\r\nTHE NYMPH: (Eyeless, in nun\xe2\x80\x99s white habit, coif and hugewinged wimple,\r\nsoftly, with remote eyes.) Tranquilla convent. Sister Agatha. Mount\r\nCarmel. The apparitions of Knock and Lourdes. No more desire. (She\r\nreclines her head, sighing.) Only the ethereal. Where dreamy creamy gull\r\nwaves o\xe2\x80\x99er the waters dull.\r\n\r\n(Bloom half rises. His back trouserbutton snaps.)\r\n\r\nTHE BUTTON: Bip!\r\n\r\n(Two sluts of the Coombe dance rainily by, shawled, yelling flatly.)\r\n\r\nTHE SLUTS:\r\n\r\n     O, Leopold lost the pin of his drawers\r\n     He didn\xe2\x80\x99t know what to do,\r\n     To keep it up,\r\n     To keep it up.\r\n\r\nBLOOM: (Coldly.) You have broken the spell. The last straw. If there\r\nwere only ethereal where would you all be, postulants and novices? Shy\r\nbut willing like an ass pissing.\r\n\r\nTHE YEWS: (Their silverfoil of leaves precipitating, their skinny arms\r\naging and swaying.) Deciduously!\r\n\r\nTHE NYMPH: (Her features hardening, gropes in the folds of her habit.)\r\nSacrilege! To attempt my virtue! (A large moist stain appears on her\r\nrobe.) Sully my innocence! You are not fit to touch the garment of a\r\npure woman. (She clutches again in her robe.) Wait. Satan, you\xe2\x80\x99ll sing\r\nno more lovesongs. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. (She draws a poniard and,\r\nclad in the sheathmail of an elected knight of nine, strikes at his\r\nloins.) Nekum!\r\n\r\nBLOOM: (Starts up, seizes her hand.) Hoy! Nebrakada! Cat o\xe2\x80\x99 nine lives!\r\nFair play, madam. No pruningknife. The fox and the grapes, is it?\r\nWhat do you lack with your barbed wire? Crucifix not thick enough? (He\r\nclutches her veil.) A holy abbot you want or Brophy, the lame gardener,\r\nor the spoutless statue of the watercarrier, or good mother Alphonsus,\r\neh Reynard?\r\n\r\nTHE NYMPH: (With a cry flees from him unveiled, her plaster cast\r\ncracking, a cloud of stench escaping from the cracks.) Poli...!\r\n\r\nBLOOM: (Calls after her.) As if you didn\xe2\x80\x99t get it on the double\r\nyourselves. No jerks and multiple mucosities all over you. I tried it.\r\nYour strength our weakness. What\xe2\x80\x99s our studfee? What will you pay on\r\nthe nail? You fee mendancers on the Riviera, I read. (The fleeing nymph\r\nraises a keen.) Eh? I have sixteen years of black slave labour behind\r\nme. And would a jury give me five shillings alimony tomorrow, eh? Fool\r\nsomeone else, not me. (He sniffs.) Rut. Onions. Stale. Sulphur. Grease.\r\n\r\n(The figure of Bella Cohen stands before him.)\r\n\r\nBELLA: You\xe2\x80\x99ll know me the next time.\r\n\r\nBLOOM: (Composed, regards her.) Pass\xc3\xa9e. Mutton dressed as lamb. Long\r\nin the tooth and superfluous hair. A raw onion the last thing at night\r\nwould benefit your complexion. And take some double chin drill. Your\r\neyes are as vapid as the glasseyes of your stuffed fox. They have the\r\ndimensions of your other features, that\xe2\x80\x99s all. I\xe2\x80\x99m not a triple screw\r\npropeller.\r\n\r\nBELLA: (Contemptuously.) You\xe2\x80\x99re not game, in fact. (Her sowcunt barks.)\r\nFbhracht!\r\n\r\nBLOOM: (Contemptuously.) Clean your nailless middle finger first, your\r\nbully\xe2\x80\x99s cold spunk is dripping from your cockscomb. Take a handful of\r\nhay and wipe yourself.\r\n\r\nBELLA: I know you, canvasser! Dead cod!\r\n\r\nBLOOM: I saw him, kipkeeper! Pox and gleet vendor!\r\n\r\nBELLA: (Turns to the piano.) Which of you was playing the dead march\r\nfrom Saul?\r\n\r\nZOE: Me. Mind your cornflowers. (She darts to the piano and bangs\r\nchords on it with crossed arms.) The cat\xe2\x80\x99s ramble through the slag. (She\r\nglances back.) Eh? Who\xe2\x80\x99s making love to my sweeties? (She darts back to\r\nthe table.) What\xe2\x80\x99s yours is mine and what\xe2\x80\x99s mine is my own.\r\n\r\n(Kitty, disconcerted, coats her teeth with the silver paper. Bloom\r\napproaches Zoe.)\r\n\r\nBLOOM: (Gently.) Give me back that potato, will you?\r\n\r\nZOE: Forfeits, a fine thing and a superfine thing.\r\n\r\nBLOOM: (With feeling.) It is nothing, but still, a relic of poor mamma.\r\n\r\nZOE:\r\n\r\n     Give a thing and take it back\r\n     God\xe2\x80\x99ll ask you where is that\r\n     You\xe2\x80\x99ll say you don\xe2\x80\x99t know\r\n     God\xe2\x80\x99ll send you down below.\r\n\r\nBLOOM: There is a memory attached to it. I should like to have it.\r\n\r\nSTEPHEN: To have or not to have that is the question.\r\n\r\nZOE: Here. (She hauls up a reef of her slip, revealing her bare thigh,\r\nand unrolls the potato from the top of her stocking.) Those that hides\r\nknows where to find.\r\n\r\nBELLA: (Frowns.) Here. This isn\xe2\x80\x99t a musical peepshow. And don\xe2\x80\x99t you\r\nsmash that piano. Who\xe2\x80\x99s paying here?\r\n\r\n(She goes to the pianola. Stephen fumbles in his pocket and, taking out\r\na banknote by its corner, hands it to her.)\r\n\r\nSTEPHEN: (With exaggerated politeness.) This silken purse I made out\r\nof the sow\xe2\x80\x99s ear of the public. Madam, excuse me. If you allow me. (He\r\nindicates vaguely Lynch and Bloom.) We are all in the same sweepstake,\r\nKinch and Lynch. Dans ce bordel o\xc3\xb9 tenons nostre \xc3\xa9tat.\r\n\r\nLYNCH: (Calls from the hearth.) Dedalus! Give her your blessing for me.\r\n\r\nSTEPHEN: (Hands Bella a coin.) Gold. She has it.\r\n\r\nBELLA: (Looks at the money, then at Stephen, then at Zoe, Florry and\r\nKitty.) Do you want three girls? It\xe2\x80\x99s ten shillings here.\r\n\r\nSTEPHEN: (Delightedly.) A hundred thousand apologies. (He fumbles again\r\nand takes out and hands her two crowns.) Permit, brevi manu, my sight is\r\nsomewhat troubled.\r\n\r\n(Bella goes to the table to count the money while Stephen talks to\r\nhimself in monosyllables. Zoe bends over the table. Kitty leans over\r\nZoe\xe2\x80\x99s neck. Lynch gets up, rights his cap and, clasping Kitty\xe2\x80\x99s waist,\r\nadds his head to the group.)\r\n\r\nFLORRY: (Strives heavily to rise.) Ow! My foot\xe2\x80\x99s asleep. (She limps over\r\nto the table. Bloom approaches.)\r\n\r\nBELLA, ZOE, KITTY, LYNCH, BLOOM: (Chattering and squabbling.) The\r\ngentleman... ten shillings... paying for the three... allow me a\r\nmoment... this gentleman pays separate... who\xe2\x80\x99s touching it?... ow!\r\n... mind who you\xe2\x80\x99re pinching... are you staying the night or a short\r\ntime?... who did?... you\xe2\x80\x99re a liar, excuse me... the gentleman paid down\r\nlike a gentleman... drink... it\xe2\x80\x99s long after eleven.\r\n\r\nSTEPHEN: (At the pianola, making a gesture of abhorrence.) No bottles!\r\nWhat, eleven? A riddle!\r\n\r\nZOE: (Lifting up her pettigown and folding a half sovereign into the top\r\nof her stocking.) Hard earned on the flat of my back.\r\n\r\nLYNCH: (Lifting Kitty from the table.) Come!\r\n\r\nKITTY: Wait. (She clutches the two crowns.)\r\n\r\nFLORRY: And me?\r\n\r\nLYNCH: Hoopla!\r\n\r\n(He lifts her, carries her and bumps her down on the sofa.)\r\n\r\nSTEPHEN:\r\n\r\n     The fox crew, the cocks flew,\r\n     The bells in heaven\r\n     Were striking eleven.\r\n     \xe2\x80\x98Tis time for her poor soul\r\n     To get out of heaven.\r\n\r\nBLOOM: (Quietly lays a half sovereign on the table between Bella and\r\nFlorry.) So. Allow me. (He takes up the poundnote.) Three times ten.\r\nWe\xe2\x80\x99re square.\r\n\r\nBELLA: (Admiringly.) You\xe2\x80\x99re such a slyboots, old cocky. I could kiss\r\nyou.\r\n\r\nZOE: (Points.) Him? Deep as a drawwell. (Lynch bends Kitty back over the\r\nsofa and kisses her. Bloom goes with the poundnote to Stephen.)\r\n\r\nBLOOM: This is yours.\r\n\r\nSTEPHEN: How is that? Le distrait or absentminded beggar. (He fumbles\r\nagain in his pocket and draws out a handful of coins. An object falls.)\r\nThat fell.\r\n\r\nBLOOM: (Stooping, picks up and hands a box of matches.) This.\r\n\r\nSTEPHEN: Lucifer. Thanks.\r\n\r\nBLOOM: (Quietly.) You had better hand over that cash to me to take care\r\nof. Why pay more?\r\n\r\nSTEPHEN: (Hands him all his coins.) Be just before you are generous.\r\n\r\nBLOOM: I will but is it wise? (He counts.) One, seven, eleven, and five.\r\nSix. Eleven. I don\xe2\x80\x99t answer for what you may have lost.\r\n\r\nSTEPHEN: Why striking eleven? Proparoxyton. Moment before the next\r\nLessing says. Thirsty fox. (He laughs loudly.) Burying his grandmother.\r\nProbably he killed her.\r\n\r\nBLOOM: That is one pound six and eleven. One pound seven, say.\r\n\r\nSTEPHEN: Doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter a rambling damn.\r\n\r\nBLOOM: No, but...\r\n\r\nSTEPHEN: (Comes to the table.) Cigarette, please. (Lynch tosses a\r\ncigarette from the sofa to the table.) And so Georgina Johnson is dead\r\nand married. (A cigarette appears on the table. Stephen looks at it.)\r\nWonder. Parlour magic. Married. Hm. (He strikes a match and proceeds to\r\nlight the cigarette with enigmatic melancholy.)\r\n\r\nLYNCH: (Watching him.) You would have a better chance of lighting it if\r\nyou held the match nearer.\r\n\r\nSTEPHEN: (Brings the match near his eye.) Lynx eye. Must get glasses.\r\nBroke them yesterday. Sixteen years ago. Distance. The eye sees all\r\nflat. (He draws the match away. It goes out.) Brain thinks. Near: far.\r\nIneluctable modality of the visible. (He frowns mysteriously.) Hm.\r\nSphinx. The beast that has two backs at midnight. Married.\r\n\r\nZOE: It was a commercial traveller married her and took her away with\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nFLORRY: (Nods.) Mr Lambe from London.\r\n\r\nSTEPHEN: Lamb of London, who takest away the sins of our world.\r\n\r\nLYNCH: (Embracing Kitty on the sofa, chants deeply.) Dona nobis pacem.\r\n\r\n(The cigarette slips from Stephen\xe2\x80\x99s fingers. Bloom picks it up and\r\nthrows it in the grate.)\r\n\r\nBLOOM: Don\xe2\x80\x99t smoke. You ought to eat. Cursed dog I met. (To Zoe.) You\r\nhave nothing?\r\n\r\nZOE: Is he hungry?\r\n\r\nSTEPHEN: (Extends his hand to her smiling and chants to the air of the\r\nbloodoath in the Dusk of the Gods.)\r\n\r\n     Hangende Hunger,\r\n     Fragende Frau,\r\n     Macht uns alle kaputt.\r\n\r\nZOE: (Tragically.) Hamlet, I am thy father\xe2\x80\x99s gimlet! (She takes\r\nhis hand.) Blue eyes beauty I\xe2\x80\x99ll read your hand. (She points to his\r\nforehead.) No wit, no wrinkles. (She counts.) Two, three, Mars, that\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncourage. (Stephen shakes his head.) No kid.\r\n\r\nLYNCH: Sheet lightning courage. The youth who could not shiver and\r\nshake. (To Zoe.) Who taught you palmistry?\r\n\r\nZOE: (Turns.) Ask my ballocks that I haven\xe2\x80\x99t got. (To Stephen.) I see it\r\nin your face. The eye, like that. (She frowns with lowered head.)\r\n\r\nLYNCH: (Laughing, slaps Kitty behind twice.) Like that. Pandybat.\r\n\r\n(Twice loudly a pandybat cracks, the coffin of the pianola flies open,\r\nthe bald little round jack-in-the-box head of Father Dolan springs up.)\r\n\r\nFATHER DOLAN: Any boy want flogging? Broke his glasses? Lazy idle little\r\nschemer. See it in your eye.\r\n\r\n(Mild, benign, rectorial, reproving, the head of Don John Conmee rises\r\nfrom the pianola coffin.)\r\n\r\nDON JOHN CONMEE: Now, Father Dolan! Now. I\xe2\x80\x99m sure that Stephen is a very\r\ngood little boy!\r\n\r\nZOE: (Examining Stephen\xe2\x80\x99s palm.) Woman\xe2\x80\x99s hand.\r\n\r\nSTEPHEN: (Murmurs.) Continue. Lie. Hold me. Caress. I never could read\r\nHis handwriting except His criminal thumbprint on the haddock.\r\n\r\nZOE: What day were you born?\r\n\r\nSTEPHEN: Thursday. Today.\r\n\r\nZOE: Thursday\xe2\x80\x99s child has far to go. (She traces lines on his hand.)\r\nLine of fate. Influential friends.\r\n\r\nFLORRY: (Pointing.) Imagination.\r\n\r\nZOE: Mount of the moon. You\xe2\x80\x99ll meet with a... (She peers at his hands\r\nabruptly.) I won\xe2\x80\x99t tell you what\xe2\x80\x99s not good for you. Or do you want to\r\nknow?\r\n\r\nBLOOM: (Detaches her fingers and offers his palm.) More harm than good.\r\nHere. Read mine.\r\n\r\nBELLA: Show. (She turns up Bloom\xe2\x80\x99s hand.) I thought so. Knobby knuckles\r\nfor the women.\r\n\r\nZOE: (Peering at Bloom\xe2\x80\x99s palm.) Gridiron. Travels beyond the sea and\r\nmarry money.\r\n\r\nBLOOM: Wrong.\r\n\r\nZOE: (Quickly.) O, I see. Short little finger. Henpecked husband. That\r\nwrong?\r\n\r\n(Black Liz, a huge rooster hatching in a chalked circle, rises,\r\nstretches her wings and clucks.)\r\n\r\nBLACK LIZ: Gara. Klook. Klook. Klook.\r\n\r\n(She sidles from her newlaid egg and waddles off.)\r\n\r\nBLOOM: (Points to his hand.) That weal there is an accident. Fell and\r\ncut it twentytwo years ago. I was sixteen.\r\n\r\nZOE: I see, says the blind man. Tell us news.\r\n\r\nSTEPHEN: See? Moves to one great goal. I am twentytwo. Sixteen years ago\r\nhe was twentytwo too. Sixteen years ago I twentytwo tumbled. Twentytwo\r\nyears ago he sixteen fell off his hobbyhorse. (He winces.) Hurt my hand\r\nsomewhere. Must see a dentist. Money?\r\n\r\n(Zoe whispers to Florry. They giggle. Bloom releases his hand and writes\r\nidly on the table in backhand, pencilling slow curves.)\r\n\r\nFLORRY: What?\r\n\r\n(A hackneycar, number three hundred and twentyfour, with a\r\ngallantbuttocked mare, driven by James Barton, Harmony Avenue,\r\nDonnybrook, trots past. Blazes Boylan and Lenehan sprawl swaying on the\r\nsideseats. The Ormond boots crouches behind on the axle. Sadly over the\r\ncrossblind Lydia Douce and Mina Kennedy gaze.)\r\n\r\nTHE BOOTS: (Jogging, mocks them with thumb and wriggling wormfingers.)\r\nHaw haw have you the horn?\r\n\r\n(Bronze by gold they whisper.)\r\n\r\nZOE: (To Florry.) Whisper.\r\n\r\n(They whisper again.)\r\n\r\n(Over the well of the car Blazes Boylan leans, his boater straw set\r\nsideways, a red flower in his mouth. Lenehan in yachtsman\xe2\x80\x99s cap and\r\nwhite shoes officiously detaches a long hair from Blazes Boylan\xe2\x80\x99s coat\r\nshoulder.)\r\n\r\nLENEHAN: Ho! What do I here behold? Were you brushing the cobwebs off a\r\nfew quims?\r\n\r\nBOYLAN: (Sated, smiles.) Plucking a turkey.\r\n\r\nLENEHAN: A good night\xe2\x80\x99s work.\r\n\r\nBOYLAN: (Holding up four thick bluntungulated fingers, winks.) Blazes\r\nKate! Up to sample or your money back. (He holds out a forefinger.)\r\nSmell that.\r\n\r\nLENEHAN: (Smells gleefully.) Ah! Lobster and mayonnaise. Ah!\r\n\r\nZOE AND FLORRY: (Laugh together.) Ha ha ha ha.\r\n\r\nBOYLAN: (Jumps surely from the car and calls loudly for all to hear.)\r\nHello, Bloom! Mrs Bloom dressed yet?\r\n\r\nBLOOM: (In flunkey\xe2\x80\x99s prune plush coat and kneebreeches, buff stockings\r\nand powdered wig.) I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid not, sir. The last articles...\r\n\r\nBOYLAN: (Tosses him sixpence.) Here, to buy yourself a gin and splash.\r\n(He hangs his hat smartly on a peg of Bloom\xe2\x80\x99s antlered head.) Show me\r\nin. I have a little private business with your wife, you understand?\r\n\r\nBLOOM: Thank you, sir. Yes, sir. Madam Tweedy is in her bath, sir.\r\n\r\nMARION: He ought to feel himself highly honoured. (She plops splashing\r\nout of the water.) Raoul darling, come and dry me. I\xe2\x80\x99m in my pelt. Only\r\nmy new hat and a carriage sponge.\r\n\r\nBOYLAN: (A merry twinkle in his eye.) Topping!\r\n\r\nBELLA: What? What is it?\r\n\r\n(Zoe whispers to her.)\r\n\r\nMARION: Let him look, the pishogue! Pimp! And scourge himself! I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nwrite to a powerful prostitute or Bartholomona, the bearded woman, to\r\nraise weals out on him an inch thick and make him bring me back a signed\r\nand stamped receipt.\r\n\r\nBOYLAN: (Clasps himself.) Here, I can\xe2\x80\x99t hold this little lot much\r\nlonger. (He strides off on stiff cavalry legs.)\r\n\r\nBELLA: (Laughing.) Ho ho ho ho.\r\n\r\nBOYLAN: (To Bloom, over his shoulder.) You can apply your eye to the\r\nkeyhole and play with yourself while I just go through her a few times.\r\n\r\nBLOOM: Thank you, sir. I will, sir. May I bring two men chums to witness\r\nthe deed and take a snapshot? (He holds out an ointment jar.) Vaseline,\r\nsir? Orangeflower...? Lukewarm water...?\r\n\r\nKITTY: (From the sofa.) Tell us, Florry. Tell us. What...\r\n\r\n(Florry whispers to her. Whispering lovewords murmur, liplapping loudly,\r\npoppysmic plopslop.)\r\n\r\nMINA KENNEDY: (Her eyes upturned.) O, it must be like the scent of\r\ngeraniums and lovely peaches! O, he simply idolises every bit of her!\r\nStuck together! Covered with kisses!\r\n\r\nLYDIA DOUCE: (Her mouth opening.) Yumyum. O, he\xe2\x80\x99s carrying her round the\r\nroom doing it! Ride a cockhorse. You could hear them in Paris and New\r\nYork. Like mouthfuls of strawberries and cream.\r\n\r\nKITTY: (Laughing.) Hee hee hee.\r\n\r\nBOYLAN\xe2\x80\x99S VOICE: (Sweetly, hoarsely, in the pit of his stomach.) Ah!\r\nGodblazeqrukbrukarchkrasht!\r\n\r\nMARION\xe2\x80\x99S VOICE: (Hoarsely, sweetly, rising to her throat.) O!\r\nWeeshwashtkissinapooisthnapoohuck?\r\n\r\nBLOOM: (His eyes wildly dilated, clasps himself.) Show! Hide! Show!\r\nPlough her! More! Shoot!\r\n\r\nBELLA, ZOE, FLORRY, KITTY: Ho ho! Ha ha! Hee hee!\r\n\r\nLYNCH: (Points.) The mirror up to nature. (He laughs.) Hu hu hu hu hu!\r\n\r\n(Stephen and Bloom gaze in the mirror. The face of William Shakespeare,\r\nbeardless, appears there, rigid in facial paralysis, crowned by the\r\nreflection of the reindeer antlered hatrack in the hall.)\r\n\r\nSHAKESPEARE: (In dignified ventriloquy.) \xe2\x80\x98Tis the loud laugh bespeaks\r\nthe vacant mind. (To Bloom.) Thou thoughtest as how thou wastest\r\ninvisible. Gaze. (He crows with a black capon\xe2\x80\x99s laugh.) Iagogo! How my\r\nOldfellow chokit his Thursdaymornun. Iagogogo!\r\n\r\nBLOOM: (Smiles yellowly at the three whores.) When will I hear the joke?\r\n\r\nZOE: Before you\xe2\x80\x99re twice married and once a widower.\r\n\r\nBLOOM: Lapses are condoned. Even the great Napoleon when measurements\r\nwere taken next the skin after his death...\r\n\r\n(Mrs Dignam, widow woman, her snubnose and cheeks flushed with\r\ndeathtalk, tears and Tunney\xe2\x80\x99s tawny sherry, hurries by in her weeds,\r\nher bonnet awry, rouging and powdering her cheeks, lips and nose, a\r\npen chivvying her brood of cygnets. Beneath her skirt appear her late\r\nhusband\xe2\x80\x99s everyday trousers and turnedup boots, large eights. She holds\r\na Scottish widow\xe2\x80\x99s insurance policy and a large marquee umbrella under\r\nwhich her brood run with her, Patsy hopping on one shod foot, his collar\r\nloose, a hank of porksteaks dangling, Freddy whimpering, Susy with a\r\ncrying cod\xe2\x80\x99s mouth, Alice struggling with the baby. She cuffs them on,\r\nher streamers flaunting aloft.)\r\n\r\nFREDDY: Ah, ma, you\xe2\x80\x99re dragging me along!\r\n\r\nSUSY: Mamma, the beeftea is fizzing over!\r\n\r\nSHAKESPEARE: (With paralytic rage.) Weda seca whokilla farst.\r\n\r\n(The face of Martin Cunningham, bearded, refeatures Shakespeare\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbeardless face. The marquee umbrella sways drunkenly, the children run\r\naside. Under the umbrella appears Mrs Cunningham in Merry Widow hat and\r\nkimono gown. She glides sidling and bowing, twirling japanesily.)\r\n\r\nMRS CUNNINGHAM: (Sings.)\r\n\r\n      And they call me the jewel of Asia!\r\n\r\nMARTIN CUNNINGHAM: (Gazes on her, impassive.) Immense!

Come to the wrong shop.\r\n\r\nLYNCH: Let him alone. He\xe2\x80\x99s back from Paris.\r\n\r\nZOE: (Runs to stephen and links him.) O go on! Give us some parleyvoo.\r\n\r\n(Stephen claps hat on head and leaps over to the fireplace where he\r\nstands with shrugged shoulders, finny hands outspread, a painted smile\r\non his face.)\r\n\r\nLYNCH: (Pommelling on the sofa.)

(He throws a shilling on the table and starts.)\r\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s for the chimney. Where? I need mountain air.\r\n\r\n(He hurries out through the hall. The whores point. Florry follows,\r\nspilling water from her tilted tumbler. On the doorstep all the whores\r\nclustered talk volubly, pointing to the right where the fog has cleared\r\noff. From the left arrives a jingling hackney car. It slows to in front\r\nof the house. Bloom at the halldoor perceives Corny Kelleher who is\r\nabout to dismount from the car with two silent lechers. He averts\r\nhis face. Bella from within the hall urges on her whores. They blow\r\nickylickysticky yumyum kisses. Corny Kelleher replies with a ghastly\r\nlewd smile. The silent lechers turn to pay the jarvey. Zoe and Kitty\r\nstill point right. Bloom, parting them swiftly, draws his caliph\xe2\x80\x99s hood\r\nand poncho and hurries down the steps with sideways face.

He\xe2\x80\x99s Bloom! Stop Bloom!\r\nStopabloom! Stopperrobber! Hi! Hi! Stophim on the corner!\r\n\r\n(At the corner of Beaver street beneath the scaffolding Bloom panting\r\nstops on the fringe of the noisy quarrelling knot, a lot not knowing a\r\njot what hi! hi! row and wrangle round the whowhat brawlaltogether.)\r\n\r\nSTEPHEN: (With elaborate gestures, breathing deeply and slowly.) You are\r\nmy guests. Uninvited. By virtue of the fifth of George and seventh of\r\nEdward. History to blame. Fabled by mothers of memory.\r\n\r\nPRIVATE CARR: (To Cissy Caffrey.) Was he insulting you?\r\n\r\nSTEPHEN: Addressed her in vocative feminine. Probably neuter.\r\nUngenitive.\r\n\r\nVOICES: No, he didn\xe2\x80\x99t. I seen him. The girl there. He was in Mrs\r\nCohen\xe2\x80\x99s. What\xe2\x80\x99s up? Soldier and civilian.\r\n\r\nCISSY CAFFREY: I was in company with the soldiers and they left me to\r\ndo\xe2\x80\x94you know, and the young man run up behind me. But I\xe2\x80\x99m faithful to the\r\nman that\xe2\x80\x99s treating me though I\xe2\x80\x99m only a shilling whore.\r\n\r\nSTEPHEN: (Catches sight of Lynch\xe2\x80\x99s and Kitty\xe2\x80\x99s heads.) Hail, Sisyphus.\r\n(He points to himself and the others.) Poetic. Uropoetic.\r\n\r\nVOICES: Shes faithfultheman.\r\n\r\nCISSY CAFFREY: Yes, to go with him. And me with a soldier friend.\r\n\r\nPRIVATE COMPTON: He doesn\xe2\x80\x99t half want a thick ear, the blighter. Biff\r\nhim one, Harry.\r\n\r\nPRIVATE CARR: (To Cissy.) Was he insulting you while me and him was\r\nhaving a piss?\r\n\r\nLORD TENNYSON: (Gentleman poet in Union Jack blazer and cricket\r\nflannels, bareheaded, flowingbearded.) Theirs not to reason why.\r\n\r\nPRIVATE COMPTON: Biff him, Harry.\r\n\r\nSTEPHEN: (To Private Compton.) I don\xe2\x80\x99t know your name but you are quite\r\nright. Doctor Swift says one man in armour will beat ten men in their\r\nshirts. Shirt is synechdoche. Part for the whole.\r\n\r\nCISSY CAFFREY: (To the crowd.) No, I was with the privates.\r\n\r\nSTEPHEN: (Amiably.) Why not? The bold soldier boy. In my opinion every\r\nlady for example...\r\n\r\nPRIVATE CARR: (His cap awry, advances to Stephen.) Say, how would it be,\r\ngovernor, if I was to bash in your jaw?\r\n\r\nSTEPHEN: (Looks up to the sky.) How? Very unpleasant. Noble art of\r\nselfpretence. Personally, I detest action. (He waves his hand.) Hand\r\nhurts me slightly. Enfin ce sont vos oignons. (To Cissy Caffrey.) Some\r\ntrouble is on here. What is it precisely?\r\n\r\nDOLLY GRAY: (From her balcony waves her handkerchief, giving the sign of\r\nthe heroine of Jericho.) Rahab. Cook\xe2\x80\x99s son, goodbye. Safe home to Dolly.\r\nDream of the girl you left behind and she will dream of you.\r\n\r\n(The soldiers turn their swimming eyes.)\r\n\r\nBLOOM: (Elbowing through the crowd, plucks Stephen\xe2\x80\x99s sleeve vigorously.)\r\nCome now, professor, that carman is waiting.\r\n\r\nSTEPHEN: (Turns.) Eh? (He disengages himself.) Why should I not speak to\r\nhim or to any human being who walks upright upon this oblate orange? (He\r\npoints his finger.) I\xe2\x80\x99m not afraid of what I can talk to if I see his\r\neye. Retaining the perpendicular.\r\n\r\n(He staggers a pace back.)\r\n\r\nBLOOM: (Propping him.) Retain your own.\r\n\r\nSTEPHEN: (Laughs emptily.) My centre of gravity is displaced. I have\r\nforgotten the trick. Let us sit down somewhere and discuss. Struggle\r\nfor life is the law of existence but but human philirenists, notably the\r\ntsar and the king of England, have invented arbitration. (He taps his\r\nbrow.) But in here it is I must kill the priest and the king.\r\n\r\nBIDDY THE CLAP: Did you hear what the professor said? He\xe2\x80\x99s a professor\r\nout of the college.\r\n\r\nCUNTY KATE: I did. I heard that.\r\n\r\nBIDDY THE CLAP: He expresses himself with such marked refinement of\r\nphraseology.\r\n\r\nCUNTY KATE: Indeed, yes. And at the same time with such apposite\r\ntrenchancy.\r\n\r\nPRIVATE CARR: (Pulls himself free and comes forward.) What\xe2\x80\x99s that you\xe2\x80\x99re\r\nsaying about my king?\r\n\r\n(Edward the Seventh appears in an archway. He wears a white jersey on\r\nwhich an image of the Sacred Heart is stitched with the insignia of\r\nGarter and Thistle, Golden Fleece, Elephant of Denmark, Skinner\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nand Probyn\xe2\x80\x99s horse, Lincoln\xe2\x80\x99s Inn bencher and ancient and honourable\r\nartillery company of Massachusetts. He sucks a red jujube. He is robed\r\nas a grand elect perfect and sublime mason with trowel and apron, marked\r\nmade in Germany. In his left hand he holds a plasterer\xe2\x80\x99s bucket on which\r\nis printed D\xc3\xa9fense d\xe2\x80\x99uriner. A roar of welcome greets him.)\r\n\r\nEDWARD THE SEVENTH: (Slowly, solemnly but indistinctly.) Peace, perfect\r\npeace. For identification, bucket in my hand. Cheerio, boys. (He turns\r\nto his subjects.) We have come here to witness a clean straight fight\r\nand we heartily wish both men the best of good luck. Mahak makar a bak.\r\n\r\n(He shakes hands with Private Carr, Private Compton, Stephen, Bloom and\r\nLynch. General applause. Edward the Seventh lifts his bucket graciously\r\nin acknowledgment.)\r\n\r\nPRIVATE CARR: (To Stephen.) Say it again.\r\n\r\nSTEPHEN: (Nervous, friendly, pulls himself up.) I understand your point\r\nof view though I have no king myself for the moment. This is the age of\r\npatent medicines. A discussion is difficult down here. But this is the\r\npoint. You die for your country. Suppose. (He places his arm on Private\r\nCarr\xe2\x80\x99s sleeve.) Not that I wish it for you. But I say: Let my country\r\ndie for me. Up to the present it has done so. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t want it to die.\r\nDamn death. Long live life!\r\n\r\nEDWARD THE SEVENTH: (Levitates over heaps of slain, in the garb and with\r\nthe halo of Joking Jesus, a white jujube in his phosphorescent face.)\r\n\r\n      My methods are new and are causing surprise.\r\n      To make the blind see I throw dust in their eyes.\r\n\r\nSTEPHEN: Kings and unicorns! (He falls back a pace.) Come somewhere and\r\nwe\xe2\x80\x99ll... What was that girl saying?...\r\n\r\nPRIVATE COMPTON: Eh, Harry, give him a kick in the knackers. Stick one\r\ninto Jerry.\r\n\r\nBLOOM: (To the privates, softly.) He doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know what he\xe2\x80\x99s saying.\r\nTaken a little more than is good for him. Absinthe. Greeneyed monster. I\r\nknow him. He\xe2\x80\x99s a gentleman, a poet. It\xe2\x80\x99s all right.\r\n\r\nSTEPHEN: (Nods, smiling and laughing.) Gentleman, patriot, scholar and\r\njudge of impostors.\r\n\r\nPRIVATE CARR: I don\xe2\x80\x99t give a bugger who he is.\r\n\r\nPRIVATE COMPTON: We don\xe2\x80\x99t give a bugger who he is.\r\n\r\nSTEPHEN: I seem to annoy them. Green rag to a bull.\r\n\r\n(Kevin Egan of Paris in black Spanish tasselled shirt and peep-o\xe2\x80\x99-day\r\nboy\xe2\x80\x99s hat signs to Stephen.)\r\n\r\nKEVIN EGAN: H\xe2\x80\x99lo! Bonjour! The vieille ogresse with the dents jaunes.\r\n\r\n(Patrice Egan peeps from behind, his rabbitface nibbling a quince leaf.)\r\n\r\nPATRICE: Socialiste!\r\n\r\nDON EMILE PATRIZIO FRANZ RUPERT POPE HENNESSY: (In medieval hauberk, two\r\nwild geese volant on his helm, with noble indignation points a mailed\r\nhand against the privates.) Werf those eykes to footboden, big grand\r\nporcos of johnyellows todos covered of gravy!\r\n\r\nBLOOM: (To Stephen.) Come home. You\xe2\x80\x99ll get into trouble.\r\n\r\nSTEPHEN: (Swaying.) I don\xe2\x80\x99t avoid it. He provokes my intelligence.\r\n\r\nBIDDY THE CLAP: One immediately observes that he is of patrician\r\nlineage.\r\n\r\nTHE VIRAGO: Green above the red, says he. Wolfe Tone.\r\n\r\nTHE BAWD: The red\xe2\x80\x99s as good as the green. And better. Up the soldiers!\r\nUp King Edward!\r\n\r\nA ROUGH: (Laughs.) Ay! Hands up to De Wet.\r\n\r\nTHE CITIZEN: (With a huge emerald muffler and shillelagh, calls.)\r\n\r\n     May the God above\r\n     Send down a dove\r\n     With teeth as sharp as razors\r\n     To slit the throats\r\n     Of the English dogs\r\n     That hanged our Irish leaders.\r\n\r\nTHE CROPPY BOY: (The ropenoose round his neck, gripes in his issuing\r\nbowels with both hands.)\r\n\r\n      I bear no hate to a living thing,\r\n      But I love my country beyond the king.\r\n\r\nRUMBOLD, DEMON BARBER: (Accompanied by two blackmasked assistants,\r\nadvances with gladstone bag which he opens.) Ladies and gents,\r\ncleaver purchased by Mrs Pearcy to slay Mogg. Knife with which Voisin\r\ndismembered the wife of a compatriot and hid remains in a sheet in the\r\ncellar, the unfortunate female\xe2\x80\x99s throat being cut from ear to ear. Phial\r\ncontaining arsenic retrieved from body of Miss Barron which sent Seddon\r\nto the gallows.\r\n\r\n(He jerks the rope. The assistants leap at the victim\xe2\x80\x99s legs and drag\r\nhim downward, grunting: the croppy boy\xe2\x80\x99s tongue protrudes violently.)\r\n\r\nTHE CROPPY BOY:\r\n\r\n      Horhot ho hray hor hother\xe2\x80\x99s hest.\r\n\r\n(He gives up the ghost. A violent erection of the hanged sends gouts\r\nof sperm spouting through his deathclothes on to the cobblestones. Mrs\r\nBellingham, Mrs Yelverton Barry and the Honourable Mrs Mervyn Talboys\r\nrush forward with their handkerchiefs to sop it up.)\r\n\r\nRUMBOLD: I\xe2\x80\x99m near it myself. (He undoes the noose.) Rope which hanged\r\nthe awful rebel. Ten shillings a time. As applied to Her Royal Highness.\r\n(He plunges his head into the gaping belly of the hanged and draws out\r\nhis head again clotted with coiled and smoking entrails.) My painful\r\nduty has now been done. God save the king!\r\n\r\nEDWARD THE SEVENTH: (Dances slowly, solemnly, rattling his bucket, and\r\nsings with soft contentment.)\r\n\r\n      On coronation day, on coronation day,\r\n      O, won\xe2\x80\x99t we have a merry time,\r\n      Drinking whisky, beer and wine!\r\n\r\nPRIVATE CARR: Here. What are you saying about my king?\r\n\r\nSTEPHEN: (Throws up his hands.) O, this is too monotonous! Nothing. He\r\nwants my money and my life, though want must be his master, for some\r\nbrutish empire of his. Money I haven\xe2\x80\x99t. (He searches his pockets\r\nvaguely.) Gave it to someone.\r\n\r\nPRIVATE CARR: Who wants your bleeding money?\r\n\r\nSTEPHEN: (Tries to move off.) Will someone tell me where I am least\r\nlikely to meet these necessary evils? \xc3\x87a se voit aussi \xc3\xa0 Paris. Not that\r\nI... But, by Saint Patrick...!\r\n\r\n(The women\xe2\x80\x99s heads coalesce. Old Gummy Granny in sugarloaf hat appears\r\nseated on a toadstool, the deathflower of the potato blight on her\r\nbreast.)\r\n\r\nSTEPHEN: Aha! I know you, gammer! Hamlet, revenge! The old sow that eats\r\nher farrow!\r\n\r\nOLD GUMMY GRANNY: (Rocking to and fro.) Ireland\xe2\x80\x99s sweetheart, the king\r\nof Spain\xe2\x80\x99s daughter, alanna. Strangers in my house, bad manners to them!\r\n(She keens with banshee woe.) Ochone! Ochone! Silk of the kine! (She\r\nwails.) You met with poor old Ireland and how does she stand?\r\n\r\nSTEPHEN: How do I stand you? The hat trick! Where\xe2\x80\x99s the third person of\r\nthe Blessed Trinity? Soggarth Aroon? The reverend Carrion Crow.\r\n\r\nCISSY CAFFREY: (Shrill.) Stop them from fighting!\r\n\r\nA ROUGH: Our men retreated.\r\n\r\nPRIVATE CARR: (Tugging at his belt.) I\xe2\x80\x99ll wring the neck of any fucker\r\nsays a word against my fucking king.\r\n\r\nBLOOM: (Terrified.) He said nothing. Not a word. A pure\r\nmisunderstanding.\r\n\r\nTHE CITIZEN: Erin go bragh!\r\n\r\n(Major Tweedy and the Citizen exhibit to each other medals, decorations,\r\ntrophies of war, wounds. Both salute with fierce hostility.)\r\n\r\nPRIVATE COMPTON: Go it, Harry. Do him one in the eye. He\xe2\x80\x99s a proboer.\r\n\r\nSTEPHEN: Did I? When?\r\n\r\nBLOOM: (To the redcoats.) We fought for you in South Africa, Irish\r\nmissile troops. Isn\xe2\x80\x99t that history? Royal Dublin Fusiliers. Honoured by\r\nour monarch.\r\n\r\nTHE NAVVY: (Staggering past.) O, yes! O God, yes! O, make the kwawr a\r\nkrowawr! O! Bo!\r\n\r\n(Casqued halberdiers in armour thrust forward a pentice of gutted\r\nspearpoints. Major Tweedy, moustached like Turko the terrible, in\r\nbearskin cap with hackleplume and accoutrements, with epaulettes, gilt\r\nchevrons and sabretaches, his breast bright with medals, toes the line.\r\nHe gives the pilgrim warrior\xe2\x80\x99s sign of the knights templars.)\r\n\r\nMAJOR TWEEDY: (Growls gruffly.) Rorke\xe2\x80\x99s Drift! Up, guards, and at them!\r\nMahar shalal hashbaz.\r\n\r\nPRIVATE CARR: I\xe2\x80\x99ll do him in.\r\n\r\nPRIVATE COMPTON: (Waves the crowd back.) Fair play, here. Make a\r\nbleeding butcher\xe2\x80\x99s shop of the bugger.\r\n\r\n(Massed bands blare Garryowen and God save the King.)\r\n\r\nCISSY CAFFREY: They\xe2\x80\x99re going to fight. For me!\r\n\r\nCUNTY KATE: The brave and the fair.\r\n\r\nBIDDY THE CLAP: Methinks yon sable knight will joust it with the best.\r\n\r\nCUNTY KATE: (Blushing deeply.) Nay, madam. The gules doublet and merry\r\nsaint George for me!\r\n\r\nSTEPHEN:\r\n\r\n      The harlot\xe2\x80\x99s cry from street to street\r\n      Shall weave Old Ireland\xe2\x80\x99s windingsheet.\r\n\r\nPRIVATE CARR: (Loosening his belt, shouts.) I\xe2\x80\x99ll wring the neck of any\r\nfucking bastard says a word against my bleeding fucking king.\r\n\r\nBLOOM: (Shakes Cissy Caffrey\xe2\x80\x99s shoulders.) Speak, you! Are you struck\r\ndumb? You are the link between nations and generations. Speak, woman,\r\nsacred lifegiver!\r\n\r\nCISSY CAFFREY: (Alarmed, seizes Private Carr\xe2\x80\x99s sleeve.) Amn\xe2\x80\x99t I with\r\nyou? Amn\xe2\x80\x99t I your girl? Cissy\xe2\x80\x99s your girl. (She cries.) Police!\r\n\r\nSTEPHEN: (Ecstatically, to Cissy Caffrey.)\r\n\r\n     White thy fambles, red thy gan\r\n     And thy quarrons dainty is.\r\n\r\nVOICES: Police!\r\n\r\nDISTANT VOICES: Dublin\xe2\x80\x99s burning! Dublin\xe2\x80\x99s burning! On fire, on fire!\r\n\r\n(Brimstone fires spring up. Dense clouds roll past. Heavy Gatling guns\r\nboom. Pandemonium. Troops deploy. Gallop of hoofs. Artillery. Hoarse\r\ncommands. Bells clang. Backers shout. Drunkards bawl. Whores screech.\r\nFoghorns hoot. Cries of valour. Shrieks of dying. Pikes clash on\r\ncuirasses. Thieves rob the slain. Birds of prey, winging from the sea,\r\nrising from marshlands, swooping from eyries, hover screaming, gannets,\r\ncormorants, vultures, goshawks, climbing woodcocks, peregrines, merlins,\r\nblackgrouse, sea eagles, gulls, albatrosses, barnacle geese. The\r\nmidnight sun is darkened. The earth trembles. The dead of Dublin\r\nfrom Prospect and Mount Jerome in white sheepskin overcoats and black\r\ngoatfell cloaks arise and appear to many. A chasm opens with a noiseless\r\nyawn. Tom Rochford, winner, in athlete\xe2\x80\x99s singlet and breeches, arrives\r\nat the head of the national hurdle handicap and leaps into the void.\r\nHe is followed by a race of runners and leapers. In wild attitudes they\r\nspring from the brink. Their bodies plunge. Factory lasses with fancy\r\nclothes toss redhot Yorkshire baraabombs. Society ladies lift their\r\nskirts above their heads to protect themselves. Laughing witches in red\r\ncutty sarks ride through the air on broomsticks. Quakerlyster plasters\r\nblisters. It rains dragons\xe2\x80\x99 teeth. Armed heroes spring up from furrows.\r\nThey exchange in amity the pass of knights of the red cross and fight\r\nduels with cavalry sabres: Wolfe Tone against Henry Grattan, Smith\r\nO\xe2\x80\x99Brien against Daniel O\xe2\x80\x99Connell, Michael Davitt against Isaac Butt,\r\nJustin M\xe2\x80\x99Carthy against Parnell, Arthur Griffith against John Redmond,\r\nJohn O\xe2\x80\x99Leary against Lear O\xe2\x80\x99Johnny, Lord Edward Fitzgerald against Lord\r\nGerald Fitzedward, The O\xe2\x80\x99Donoghue of the Glens against The Glens of\r\nThe O\xe2\x80\x99Donoghue. On an eminence, the centre of the earth, rises the\r\nfieldaltar of Saint Barbara. Black candles rise from its gospel and\r\nepistle horns. From the high barbacans of the tower two shafts of light\r\nfall on the smokepalled altarstone. On the altarstone Mrs Mina Purefoy,\r\ngoddess of unreason, lies, naked, fettered, a chalice resting on her\r\nswollen belly. Father Malachi O\xe2\x80\x99Flynn in a lace petticoat and reversed\r\nchasuble, his two left feet back to the front, celebrates camp mass. The\r\nReverend Mr Hugh C Haines Love M. A. in a plain cassock and mortarboard,\r\nhis head and collar back to the front, holds over the celebrant\xe2\x80\x99s head\r\nan open umbrella.)\r\n\r\nFATHER MALACHI O\xe2\x80\x99FLYNN: Introibo ad altare diaboli.\r\n\r\nTHE REVEREND MR HAINES LOVE: To the devil which hath made glad my young\r\ndays.\r\n\r\nFATHER MALACHI O\xe2\x80\x99FLYNN: (Takes from the chalice and elevates a\r\nblooddripping host.) Corpus meum.\r\n\r\nTHE REVEREND MR HAINES LOVE: (Raises high behind the celebrant\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npetticoat, revealing his grey bare hairy buttocks between which a carrot\r\nis stuck.) My body.\r\n\r\nTHE VOICE OF ALL THE DAMNED: Htengier Tnetopinmo Dog Drol eht rof,\r\nAiulella!\r\n\r\n(From on high the voice of Adonai calls.)\r\n\r\nADONAI: Dooooooooooog!\r\n\r\nTHE VOICE OF ALL THE BLESSED: Alleluia, for the Lord God Omnipotent\r\nreigneth!\r\n\r\n(From on high the voice of Adonai calls.)\r\n\r\nADONAI: Goooooooooood!\r\n\r\n(In strident discord peasants and townsmen of Orange and Green factions\r\nsing Kick the Pope and Daily, daily sing to Mary.)\r\n\r\nPRIVATE CARR: (With ferocious articulation.) I\xe2\x80\x99ll do him in, so help me\r\nfucking Christ! I\xe2\x80\x99ll wring the bastard fucker\xe2\x80\x99s bleeding blasted fucking\r\nwindpipe!\r\n\r\n(The retriever, nosing on the fringe of the crowd, barks noisily.)\r\n\r\nOLD GUMMY GRANNY: (Thrusts a dagger towards Stephen\xe2\x80\x99s hand.) Remove him,\r\nacushla. At 8.35 a.m. you will be in heaven and Ireland will be free.\r\n(She prays.) O good God, take him!\r\n\r\nBLOOM: (Runs to Lynch.) Can\xe2\x80\x99t you get him away?\r\n\r\nLYNCH: He likes dialectic, the universal language. Kitty! (To Bloom.)\r\nGet him away, you. He won\xe2\x80\x99t listen to me.\r\n\r\n(He drags Kitty away.)\r\n\r\nSTEPHEN: (Points.) Exit Judas. Et laqueo se suspendit.\r\n\r\nBLOOM: (Runs to Stephen.) Come along with me now before worse happens.\r\nHere\xe2\x80\x99s your stick.\r\n\r\nSTEPHEN: Stick, no. Reason. This feast of pure reason.\r\n\r\nCISSY CAFFREY: (Pulling Private Carr.) Come on, you\xe2\x80\x99re boosed. He\r\ninsulted me but I forgive him. (Shouting in his ear.) I forgive him for\r\ninsulting me.\r\n\r\nBLOOM: (Over Stephen\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder.) Yes, go. You see he\xe2\x80\x99s incapable.\r\n\r\nPRIVATE CARR: (Breaks loose.) I\xe2\x80\x99ll insult him.\r\n\r\n(He rushes towards Stephen, fist outstretched, and strikes him in the\r\nface. Stephen totters, collapses, falls, stunned. He lies prone, his\r\nface to the sky, his hat rolling to the wall. Bloom follows and picks it\r\nup.)\r\n\r\nMAJOR TWEEDY: (Loudly.) Carbine in bucket! Cease fire! Salute!\r\n\r\nTHE RETRIEVER: (Barking furiously.) Ute ute ute ute ute ute ute ute.\r\n\r\nTHE CROWD: Let him up! Don\xe2\x80\x99t strike him when he\xe2\x80\x99s down! Air! Who? The\r\nsoldier hit him. He\xe2\x80\x99s a professor. Is he hurted? Don\xe2\x80\x99t manhandle him!\r\nHe\xe2\x80\x99s fainted!\r\n\r\nA HAG: What call had the redcoat to strike the gentleman and he under\r\nthe influence.

He gave him the coward\xe2\x80\x99s blow.\r\n\r\n(They grab at each other\xe2\x80\x99s hair, claw at each other and spit.)\r\n\r\nTHE RETRIEVER: (Barking.) Wow wow wow.\r\n\r\nBLOOM: (Shoves them back, loudly.) Get back, stand back!\r\n\r\nPRIVATE COMPTON: (Tugging his comrade.) Here. Bugger off, Harry. Here\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nthe cops! (Two raincaped watch, tall, stand in the group.)\r\n\r\nFIRST WATCH: What\xe2\x80\x99s wrong here?\r\n\r\nPRIVATE COMPTON: We were with this lady. And he insulted us. And\r\nassaulted my chum. (The retriever barks.) Who owns the bleeding tyke?\r\n\r\nCISSY CAFFREY: (With expectation.) Is he bleeding!\r\n\r\nA MAN: (Rising from his knees.) No. Gone off. He\xe2\x80\x99ll come to all right.\r\n\r\nBLOOM: (Glances sharply at the man.) Leave him to me. I can easily...\r\n\r\nSECOND WATCH: Who are you? Do you know him?\r\n\r\nPRIVATE CARR: (Lurches towards the watch.) He insulted my lady friend.\r\n\r\nBLOOM: (Angrily.) You hit him without provocation. I\xe2\x80\x99m a witness.\r\nConstable, take his regimental number.\r\n\r\nSECOND WATCH: I don\xe2\x80\x99t want your instructions in the discharge of my\r\nduty.\r\n\r\nPRIVATE COMPTON: (Pulling his comrade.) Here, bugger off Harry. Or\r\nBennett\xe2\x80\x99ll shove you in the lockup.\r\n\r\nPRIVATE CARR: (Staggering as he is pulled away.) God fuck old Bennett.\r\nHe\xe2\x80\x99s a whitearsed bugger. I don\xe2\x80\x99t give a shit for him.\r\n\r\nFIRST WATCH: (Takes out his notebook.) What\xe2\x80\x99s his name?\r\n\r\nBLOOM: (Peering over the crowd.) I just see a car there. If you give me\r\na hand a second, sergeant...\r\n\r\nFIRST WATCH: Name and address.\r\n\r\n(Corny Kelleher, weepers round his hat, a death wreath in his hand,\r\nappears among the bystanders.)\r\n\r\nBLOOM: (Quickly.) O, the very man! (He whispers.) Simon Dedalus\xe2\x80\x99 son. A\r\nbit sprung. Get those policemen to move those loafers back.\r\n\r\nSECOND WATCH: Night, Mr Kelleher.\r\n\r\nCORNY KELLEHER: (To the watch, with drawling eye.) That\xe2\x80\x99s all right.\r\nI know him. Won a bit on the races. Gold cup. Throwaway. (He laughs.)\r\nTwenty to one. Do you follow me?\r\n\r\nFIRST WATCH: (Turns to the crowd.) Here, what are you all gaping at?\r\nMove on out of that.\r\n\r\n(The crowd disperses slowly, muttering, down the lane.)\r\n\r\nCORNY KELLEHER: Leave it to me, sergeant. That\xe2\x80\x99ll be all right. (He\r\nlaughs, shaking his head.) We were often as bad ourselves, ay or worse.\r\nWhat? Eh, what?\r\n\r\nFIRST WATCH: (Laughs.) I suppose so.\r\n\r\nCORNY KELLEHER: (Nudges the second watch.) Come and wipe your name off\r\nthe slate. (He lilts, wagging his head.) With my tooraloom tooraloom\r\ntooraloom tooraloom. What, eh, do you follow me?\r\n\r\nSECOND WATCH: (Genially.) Ah, sure we were too.\r\n\r\nCORNY KELLEHER: (Winking.) Boys will be boys. I\xe2\x80\x99ve a car round there.\r\n\r\nSECOND WATCH: All right, Mr Kelleher. Good night.\r\n\r\nCORNY KELLEHER: I\xe2\x80\x99ll see to that.\r\n\r\nBLOOM: (Shakes hands with both of the watch in turn.) Thank you very\r\nmuch, gentlemen. Thank you. (He mumbles confidentially.) We don\xe2\x80\x99t want\r\nany scandal, you understand. Father is a wellknown highly respected\r\ncitizen. Just a little wild oats, you understand.\r\n\r\nFIRST WATCH: O. I understand, sir.\r\n\r\nSECOND WATCH: That\xe2\x80\x99s all right, sir.\r\n\r\nFIRST WATCH: It was only in case of corporal injuries I\xe2\x80\x99d have to report\r\nit at the station.\r\n\r\nBLOOM: (Nods rapidly.) Naturally. Quite right. Only your bounden duty.\r\n\r\nSECOND WATCH: It\xe2\x80\x99s our duty.\r\n\r\nCORNY KELLEHER: Good night, men.\r\n\r\nTHE WATCH: (Saluting together.) Night, gentlemen. (They move off with\r\nslow heavy tread.)\r\n\r\nBLOOM: (Blows.) Providential you came on the scene. You have a car?...\r\n\r\nCORNY KELLEHER: (Laughs, pointing his thumb over his right shoulder to\r\nthe car brought up against the scaffolding.) Two commercials that were\r\nstanding fizz in Jammet\xe2\x80\x99s. Like princes, faith. One of them lost two\r\nquid on the race. Drowning his grief. And were on for a go with the\r\njolly girls. So I landed them up on Behan\xe2\x80\x99s car and down to nighttown.\r\n\r\nBLOOM: I was just going home by Gardiner street when I happened to...\r\n\r\nCORNY KELLEHER: (Laughs.) Sure they wanted me to join in with the mots.\r\nNo, by God, says I. Not for old stagers like myself and yourself. (He\r\nlaughs again and leers with lacklustre eye.) Thanks be to God we have it\r\nin the house, what, eh, do you follow me? Hah, hah, hah!\r\n\r\nBLOOM: (Tries to laugh.) He, he, he! Yes. Matter of fact I was just\r\nvisiting an old friend of mine there, Virag, you don\xe2\x80\x99t know him (poor\r\nfellow, he\xe2\x80\x99s laid up for the past week) and we had a liquor together and\r\nI was just making my way home...\r\n\r\n(The horse neighs.)\r\n\r\nTHE HORSE: Hohohohohohoh! Hohohohome!\r\n\r\nCORNY KELLEHER: Sure it was Behan our jarvey there that told me after\r\nwe left the two commercials in Mrs Cohen\xe2\x80\x99s and I told him to pull up and\r\ngot off to see. (He laughs.) Sober hearsedrivers a speciality. Will I\r\ngive him a lift home? Where does he hang out? Somewhere in Cabra, what?\r\n\r\nBLOOM: No, in Sandycove, I believe, from what he let drop.\r\n\r\n(Stephen, prone, breathes to the stars. Corny Kelleher, asquint, drawls\r\nat the horse. Bloom, in gloom, looms down.)\r\n\r\nCORNY KELLEHER: (Scratches his nape.) Sandycove! (He bends down and\r\ncalls to Stephen.) Eh! (He calls again.) Eh! He\xe2\x80\x99s covered with shavings\r\nanyhow. Take care they didn\xe2\x80\x99t lift anything off him.\r\n\r\nBLOOM: No, no, no. I have his money and his hat here and stick.\r\n\r\nCORNY KELLEHER: Ah, well, he\xe2\x80\x99ll get over it. No bones broken. Well, I\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\nshove along. (He laughs.) I\xe2\x80\x99ve a rendezvous in the morning. Burying the\r\ndead. Safe home!\r\n\r\nTHE HORSE: (Neighs.) Hohohohohome.\r\n\r\nBLOOM: Good night. I\xe2\x80\x99ll just wait and take him along in a few...\r\n\r\n(Corny Kelleher returns to the outside car and mounts it. The horse\r\nharness jingles.)\r\n\r\nCORNY KELLEHER: (From the car, standing.) Night.\r\n\r\nBLOOM: Night.\r\n\r\n(The jarvey chucks the reins and raises his whip encouragingly. The\r\ncar and horse back slowly, awkwardly, and turn. Corny Kelleher on the\r\nsideseat sways his head to and fro in sign of mirth at Bloom\xe2\x80\x99s plight.\r\nThe jarvey joins in the mute pantomimic merriment nodding from the\r\nfarther seat. Bloom shakes his head in mute mirthful reply. With thumb\r\nand palm Corny Kelleher reassures that the two bobbies will allow the\r\nsleep to continue for what else is to be done. With a slow nod Bloom\r\nconveys his gratitude as that is exactly what Stephen needs. The car\r\njingles tooraloom round the corner of the tooraloom lane. Corny Kelleher\r\nagain reassuralooms with his hand. Bloom with his hand assuralooms Corny\r\nKelleher that he is reassuraloomtay. The tinkling hoofs and jingling\r\nharness grow fainter with their tooralooloo looloo lay. Bloom, holding\r\nin his hand Stephen\xe2\x80\x99s hat, festooned with shavings, and ashplant, stands\r\nirresolute. Then he bends to him and shakes him by the shoulder.)\r\n\r\nBLOOM: Eh! Ho! (There is no answer; he bends again.) Mr Dedalus! (There\r\nis no answer.) The name if you call. Somnambulist. (He bends again\r\nand, hesitating, brings his mouth near the face of the prostrate form.)\r\nStephen! (There is no answer. He calls again.) Stephen!\r\n\r\nSTEPHEN: (Groans.) Who? Black panther. Vampire. (He sighs and stretches\r\nhimself, then murmurs thickly with prolonged vowels.)\r\n\r\n     Who... drive... Fergus now\r\n     And pierce... wood\xe2\x80\x99s woven shade?...\r\n\r\n(He turns on his left side, sighing, doubling himself together.)\r\n\r\nBLOOM: Poetry. Well educated. Pity. (He bends again and undoes\r\nthe buttons of Stephen\xe2\x80\x99s waistcoat.) To breathe. (He brushes the\r\nwoodshavings from Stephen\xe2\x80\x99s clothes with light hand and fingers.) One\r\npound seven. Not hurt anyhow. (He listens.) What?\r\n\r\nSTEPHEN: (Murmurs.)\r\n\r\n    ... shadows... the woods\r\n    ... white breast... dim sea.\r\n\r\n(He stretches out his arms, sighs again and curls his body. Bloom,\r\nholding the hat and ashplant, stands erect. A dog barks in the distance.\r\nBloom tightens and loosens his grip on the ashplant. He looks down on\r\nStephen\xe2\x80\x99s face and form.)\r\n\r\nBLOOM: (Communes with the night.) Face reminds me of his poor mother.\r\nIn the shady wood. The deep white breast. Ferguson, I think I caught.\r\nA girl. Some girl. Best thing could happen him. (He murmurs.)... swear\r\nthat I will always hail, ever conceal, never reveal, any part or parts,\r\nart or arts... (He murmurs.)... in the rough sands of the sea... a\r\ncabletow\xe2\x80\x99s length from the shore... where the tide ebbs... and flows ...\r\n\r\n(Silent, thoughtful, alert he stands on guard, his fingers at his lips\r\nin the attitude of secret master. Against the dark wall a figure appears\r\nslowly, a fairy boy of eleven, a changeling, kidnapped, dressed in an\r\nEton suit with glass shoes and a little bronze helmet, holding a book\r\nin his hand. He reads from right to left inaudibly, smiling, kissing the\r\npage.)\r\n\r\nBLOOM: (Wonderstruck, calls inaudibly.) Rudy!\r\n\r\nRUDY: (Gazes, unseeing, into Bloom\xe2\x80\x99s eyes and goes on reading, kissing,\r\nsmiling. He has a delicate mauve face. On his suit he has diamond and\r\nruby buttons. In his free left hand he holds a slim ivory cane with a\r\nviolet bowknot. A white lambkin peeps out of his waistcoat pocket.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94 III \xe2\x80\x94\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[ 16 ]\r\n\r\nPreparatory to anything else Mr Bloom brushed off the greater bulk of\r\nthe shavings and handed Stephen the hat and ashplant and bucked him up\r\ngenerally in orthodox Samaritan fashion which he very badly needed. His\r\n(Stephen\xe2\x80\x99s) mind was not exactly what you would call wandering but a bit\r\nunsteady and on his expressed desire for some beverage to drink Mr\r\nBloom in view of the hour it was and there being no pump of Vartry water\r\navailable for their ablutions let alone drinking purposes hit upon an\r\nexpedient by suggesting, off the reel, the propriety of the cabman\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nshelter, as it was called, hardly a stonesthrow away near Butt bridge\r\nwhere they might hit upon some drinkables in the shape of a milk and\r\nsoda or a mineral. But how to get there was the rub. For the nonce he\r\nwas rather nonplussed but inasmuch as the duty plainly devolved upon him\r\nto take some measures on the subject he pondered suitable ways and means\r\nduring which Stephen repeatedly yawned. So far as he could see he was\r\nrather pale in the face so that it occurred to him as highly advisable\r\nto get a conveyance of some description which would answer in their\r\nthen condition, both of them being e.d.ed, particularly Stephen, always\r\nassuming that there was such a thing to be found. Accordingly after a\r\nfew such preliminaries as brushing, in spite of his having forgotten\r\nto take up his rather soapsuddy handkerchief after it had done yeoman\r\nservice in the shaving line, they both walked together along Beaver\r\nstreet or, more properly, lane as far as the farrier\xe2\x80\x99s and the\r\ndistinctly fetid atmosphere of the livery stables at the corner of\r\nMontgomery street where they made tracks to the left from thence\r\ndebouching into Amiens street round by the corner of Dan Bergin\xe2\x80\x99s. But\r\nas he confidently anticipated there was not a sign of a Jehu plying for\r\nhire anywhere to be seen except a fourwheeler, probably engaged by some\r\nfellows inside on the spree, outside the North Star hotel and there was\r\nno symptom of its budging a quarter of an inch when Mr Bloom, who was\r\nanything but a professional whistler, endeavoured to hail it by emitting\r\na kind of a whistle, holding his arms arched over his head, twice.\r\n\r\nThis was a quandary but, bringing common sense to bear on it, evidently\r\nthere was nothing for it but put a good face on the matter and foot it\r\nwhich they accordingly did. So, bevelling around by Mullett\xe2\x80\x99s and the\r\nSignal House which they shortly reached, they proceeded perforce in the\r\ndirection of Amiens street railway terminus, Mr Bloom being handicapped\r\nby the circumstance that one of the back buttons of his trousers had,\r\nto vary the timehonoured adage, gone the way of all buttons though,\r\nentering thoroughly into the spirit of the thing, he heroically made\r\nlight of the mischance. So as neither of them were particularly pressed\r\nfor time, as it happened, and the temperature refreshing since it\r\ncleared up after the recent visitation of Jupiter Pluvius, they dandered\r\nalong past by where the empty vehicle was waiting without a fare or a\r\njarvey. As it so happened a Dublin United Tramways Company\xe2\x80\x99s sandstrewer\r\nhappened to be returning and the elder man recounted to his companion\r\n\xc3\xa0 propos of the incident his own truly miraculous escape of some little\r\nwhile back. They passed the main entrance of the Great Northern railway\r\nstation, the starting point for Belfast, where of course all traffic was\r\nsuspended at that late hour and passing the backdoor of the morgue\r\n(a not very enticing locality, not to say gruesome to a degree, more\r\nespecially at night) ultimately gained the Dock Tavern and in due course\r\nturned into Store street, famous for its C division police station.\r\nBetween this point and the high at present unlit warehouses of Beresford\r\nplace Stephen thought to think of Ibsen, associated with Baird\xe2\x80\x99s the\r\nstonecutter\xe2\x80\x99s in his mind somehow in Talbot place, first turning on the\r\nright, while the other who was acting as his fidus Achates inhaled with\r\ninternal satisfaction the smell of James Rourke\xe2\x80\x99s city bakery, situated\r\nquite close to where they were, the very palatable odour indeed of\r\nour daily bread, of all commodities of the public the primary and most\r\nindispensable. Bread, the staff of life, earn your bread, O tell me\r\nwhere is fancy bread, at Rourke\xe2\x80\x99s the baker\xe2\x80\x99s it is said.\r\n\r\nEn route to his taciturn and, not to put too fine a point on it, not\r\nyet perfectly sober companion Mr Bloom who at all events was in complete\r\npossession of his faculties, never more so, in fact disgustingly sober,\r\nspoke a word of caution re the dangers of nighttown, women of ill fame\r\nand swell mobsmen, which, barely permissible once in a while though not\r\nas a habitual practice, was of the nature of a regular deathtrap for\r\nyoung fellows of his age particularly if they had acquired drinking\r\nhabits under the influence of liquor unless you knew a little jiujitsu\r\nfor every contingency as even a fellow on the broad of his back could\r\nadminister a nasty kick if you didn\xe2\x80\x99t look out. Highly providential\r\nwas the appearance on the scene of Corny Kelleher when Stephen was\r\nblissfully unconscious but for that man in the gap turning up at the\r\neleventh hour the finis might have been that he might have been a\r\ncandidate for the accident ward or, failing that, the bridewell and\r\nan appearance in the court next day before Mr Tobias or, he being the\r\nsolicitor rather, old Wall, he meant to say, or Mahony which simply\r\nspelt ruin for a chap when it got bruited about. The reason he mentioned\r\nthe fact was that a lot of those policemen, whom he cordially disliked,\r\nwere admittedly unscrupulous in the service of the Crown and, as Mr\r\nBloom put it, recalling a case or two in the A division in Clanbrassil\r\nstreet, prepared to swear a hole through a ten gallon pot. Never on\r\nthe spot when wanted but in quiet parts of the city, Pembroke road for\r\nexample, the guardians of the law were well in evidence, the obvious\r\nreason being they were paid to protect the upper classes. Another thing\r\nhe commented on was equipping soldiers with firearms or sidearms of\r\nany description liable to go off at any time which was tantamount to\r\ninciting them against civilians should by any chance they fall out over\r\nanything. You frittered away your time, he very sensibly maintained, and\r\nhealth and also character besides which, the squandermania of the thing,\r\nfast women of the demimonde ran away with a lot of \xc2\xa3. s. d. into the\r\nbargain and the greatest danger of all was who you got drunk with\r\nthough, touching the much vexed question of stimulants, he relished a\r\nglass of choice old wine in season as both nourishing and bloodmaking\r\nand possessing aperient virtues (notably a good burgundy which he was\r\na staunch believer in) still never beyond a certain point where he\r\ninvariably drew the line as it simply led to trouble all round to say\r\nnothing of your being at the tender mercy of others practically. Most\r\nof all he commented adversely on the desertion of Stephen by all his\r\npubhunting confr\xc3\xa8res but one, a most glaring piece of ratting on the\r\npart of his brother medicos under all the circs.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94And that one was Judas, Stephen said, who up to then had said nothing\r\nwhatsoever of any kind.\r\n\r\nDiscussing these and kindred topics they made a beeline across the back\r\nof the Customhouse and passed under the Loop Line bridge where a brazier\r\nof coke burning in front of a sentrybox or something like one attracted\r\ntheir rather lagging footsteps. Stephen of his own accord stopped for\r\nno special reason to look at the heap of barren cobblestones and by\r\nthe light emanating from the brazier he could just make out the darker\r\nfigure of the corporation watchman inside the gloom of the sentrybox. He\r\nbegan to remember that this had happened or had been mentioned as having\r\nhappened before but it cost him no small effort before he remembered\r\nthat he recognised in the sentry a quondam friend of his father\xe2\x80\x99s,\r\nGumley. To avoid a meeting he drew nearer to the pillars of the railway\r\nbridge.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Someone saluted you, Mr Bloom said.\r\n\r\nA figure of middle height on the prowl evidently under the arches\r\nsaluted again, calling:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Night!\r\n\r\nStephen of course started rather dizzily and stopped to return the\r\ncompliment. Mr Bloom actuated by motives of inherent delicacy inasmuch\r\nas he always believed in minding his own business moved off but\r\nnevertheless remained on the qui vive with just a shade of anxiety\r\nthough not funkyish in the least. Though unusual in the Dublin area he\r\nknew that it was not by any means unknown for desperadoes who had next\r\nto nothing to live on to be abroad waylaying and generally terrorising\r\npeaceable pedestrians by placing a pistol at their head in some\r\nsecluded spot outside the city proper, famished loiterers of the\r\nThames embankment category they might be hanging about there or simply\r\nmarauders ready to decamp with whatever boodle they could in one fell\r\nswoop at a moment\xe2\x80\x99s notice, your money or your life, leaving you there\r\nto point a moral, gagged and garrotted.\r\n\r\nStephen, that is when the accosting figure came to close quarters,\r\nthough he was not in an over sober state himself recognised Corley\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nbreath redolent of rotten cornjuice. Lord John Corley some called him\r\nand his genealogy came about in this wise. He was the eldest son of\r\ninspector Corley of the G division, lately deceased, who had married\r\na certain Katherine Brophy, the daughter of a Louth farmer. His\r\ngrandfather Patrick Michael Corley of New Ross had married the widow\r\nof a publican there whose maiden name had been Katherine (also) Talbot.\r\nRumour had it (though not proved) that she descended from the house of\r\nthe lords Talbot de Malahide in whose mansion, really an unquestionably\r\nfine residence of its kind and well worth seeing, her mother or aunt or\r\nsome relative, a woman, as the tale went, of extreme beauty, had enjoyed\r\nthe distinction of being in service in the washkitchen. This therefore\r\nwas the reason why the still comparatively young though dissolute\r\nman who now addressed Stephen was spoken of by some with facetious\r\nproclivities as Lord John Corley.\r\n\r\nTaking Stephen on one side he had the customary doleful ditty to tell.\r\nNot as much as a farthing to purchase a night\xe2\x80\x99s lodgings. His friends\r\nhad all deserted him. Furthermore he had a row with Lenehan and called\r\nhim to Stephen a mean bloody swab with a sprinkling of a number of other\r\nuncalledfor expressions. He was out of a job and implored of Stephen to\r\ntell him where on God\xe2\x80\x99s earth he could get something, anything at all,\r\nto do. No, it was the daughter of the mother in the washkitchen that\r\nwas fostersister to the heir of the house or else they were connected\r\nthrough the mother in some way, both occurrences happening at the same\r\ntime if the whole thing wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a complete fabrication from start to\r\nfinish. Anyhow he was all in.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t ask you only, pursued he, on my solemn oath and God knows\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99m on the rocks.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94There\xe2\x80\x99ll be a job tomorrow or next day, Stephen told him, in a boys\xe2\x80\x99\r\nschool at Dalkey for a gentleman usher. Mr Garrett Deasy. Try it. You\r\nmay mention my name.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Ah, God, Corley replied, sure I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t teach in a school, man. I was\r\nnever one of your bright ones, he added with a half laugh. I got stuck\r\ntwice in the junior at the christian brothers.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I have no place to sleep myself, Stephen informed him.\r\n\r\nCorley at the first go-off was inclined to suspect it was something to\r\ndo with Stephen being fired out of his digs for bringing in a bloody\r\ntart off the street. There was a dosshouse in Marlborough street, Mrs\r\nMaloney\xe2\x80\x99s, but it was only a tanner touch and full of undesirables but\r\nM\xe2\x80\x99Conachie told him you got a decent enough do in the Brazen Head over\r\nin Winetavern street (which was distantly suggestive to the person\r\naddressed of friar Bacon) for a bob. He was starving too though he\r\nhadn\xe2\x80\x99t said a word about it.\r\n\r\nThough this sort of thing went on every other night or very near it\r\nstill Stephen\xe2\x80\x99s feelings got the better of him in a sense though he knew\r\nthat Corley\xe2\x80\x99s brandnew rigmarole on a par with the others was hardly\r\ndeserving of much credence. However haud ignarus malorum miseris\r\nsuccurrere disco etcetera as the Latin poet remarks especially as luck\r\nwould have it he got paid his screw after every middle of the month on\r\nthe sixteenth which was the date of the month as a matter of fact though\r\na good bit of the wherewithal was demolished. But the cream of the joke\r\nwas nothing would get it out of Corley\xe2\x80\x99s head that he was living in\r\naffluence and hadn\xe2\x80\x99t a thing to do but hand out the needful. Whereas.\r\nHe put his hand in a pocket anyhow not with the idea of finding any food\r\nthere but thinking he might lend him anything up to a bob or so in lieu\r\nso that he might endeavour at all events and get sufficient to eat but\r\nthe result was in the negative for, to his chagrin, he found his cash\r\nmissing. A few broken biscuits were all the result of his investigation.\r\nHe tried his hardest to recollect for the moment whether he had lost\r\nas well he might have or left because in that contingency it was not a\r\npleasant lookout, very much the reverse in fact. He was altogether too\r\nfagged out to institute a thorough search though he tried to recollect.\r\nAbout biscuits he dimly remembered. Who now exactly gave them he\r\nwondered or where was or did he buy. However in another pocket he came\r\nacross what he surmised in the dark were pennies, erroneously however,\r\nas it turned out.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Those are halfcrowns, man, Corley corrected him.\r\n\r\nAnd so in point of fact they turned out to be. Stephen anyhow lent him\r\none of them.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Thanks, Corley answered, you\xe2\x80\x99re a gentleman. I\xe2\x80\x99ll pay you back one\r\ntime. Who\xe2\x80\x99s that with you? I saw him a few times in the Bleeding Horse\r\nin Camden street with Boylan, the billsticker. You might put in a good\r\nword for us to get me taken on there. I\xe2\x80\x99d carry a sandwichboard only\r\nthe girl in the office told me they\xe2\x80\x99re full up for the next three weeks,\r\nman. God, you\xe2\x80\x99ve to book ahead, man, you\xe2\x80\x99d think it was for the Carl\r\nRosa. I don\xe2\x80\x99t give a shite anyway so long as I get a job, even as a\r\ncrossing sweeper.\r\n\r\nSubsequently being not quite so down in the mouth after the two and six\r\nhe got he informed Stephen about a fellow by the name of Bags Comisky\r\nthat he said Stephen knew well out of Fullam\xe2\x80\x99s, the shipchandler\xe2\x80\x99s,\r\nbookkeeper there that used to be often round in Nagle\xe2\x80\x99s back with O\xe2\x80\x99Mara\r\nand a little chap with a stutter the name of Tighe. Anyhow he was lagged\r\nthe night before last and fined ten bob for a drunk and disorderly and\r\nrefusing to go with the constable.\r\n\r\nMr Bloom in the meanwhile kept dodging about in the vicinity of the\r\ncobblestones near the brazier of coke in front of the corporation\r\nwatchman\xe2\x80\x99s sentrybox who evidently a glutton for work, it struck him,\r\nwas having a quiet forty winks for all intents and purposes on his own\r\nprivate account while Dublin slept. He threw an odd eye at the same time\r\nnow and then at Stephen\xe2\x80\x99s anything but immaculately attired interlocutor\r\nas if he had seen that nobleman somewhere or other though where he was\r\nnot in a position to truthfully state nor had he the remotest idea when.\r\nBeing a levelheaded individual who could give points to not a few in\r\npoint of shrewd observation he also remarked on his very dilapidated\r\nhat and slouchy wearing apparel generally testifying to a chronic\r\nimpecuniosity. Palpably he was one of his hangerson but for the\r\nmatter of that it was merely a question of one preying on his nextdoor\r\nneighbour all round, in every deep, so to put it, a deeper depth and for\r\nthe matter of that if the man in the street chanced to be in the dock\r\nhimself penal servitude with or without the option of a fine would be\r\na very rara avis altogether. In any case he had a consummate amount of\r\ncool assurance intercepting people at that hour of the night or morning.\r\nPretty thick that was certainly.\r\n\r\nThe pair parted company and Stephen rejoined Mr Bloom who, with his\r\npractised eye, was not without perceiving that he had succumbed to the\r\nblandiloquence of the other parasite. Alluding to the encounter he said,\r\nlaughingly, Stephen, that is:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94He is down on his luck. He asked me to ask you to ask somebody named\r\nBoylan, a billsticker, to give him a job as a sandwichman.\r\n\r\nAt this intelligence, in which he seemingly evinced little interest, Mr\r\nBloom gazed abstractedly for the space of a half a second or so in the\r\ndirection of a bucketdredger, rejoicing in the farfamed name of Eblana,\r\nmoored alongside Customhouse quay and quite possibly out of repair,\r\nwhereupon he observed evasively:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Everybody gets their own ration of luck, they say. Now you mention it\r\nhis face was familiar to me. But, leaving that for the moment, how much\r\ndid you part with, he queried, if I am not too inquisitive?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Half a crown, Stephen responded. I daresay he needs it to sleep\r\nsomewhere.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Needs! Mr Bloom ejaculated, professing not the least surprise at\r\nthe intelligence, I can quite credit the assertion and I guarantee he\r\ninvariably does. Everyone according to his needs or everyone according\r\nto his deeds. But, talking about things in general, where, added he with\r\na smile, will you sleep yourself? Walking to Sandycove is out of\r\nthe question. And even supposing you did you won\xe2\x80\x99t get in after what\r\noccurred at Westland Row station. Simply fag out there for nothing. I\r\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t mean to presume to dictate to you in the slightest degree but why\r\ndid you leave your father\xe2\x80\x99s house?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94To seek misfortune, was Stephen\xe2\x80\x99s answer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I met your respected father on a recent occasion, Mr Bloom\r\ndiplomatically returned, today in fact, or to be strictly accurate, on\r\nyesterday. Where does he live at present? I gathered in the course of\r\nconversation that he had moved.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I believe he is in Dublin somewhere, Stephen answered unconcernedly.\r\nWhy?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94A gifted man, Mr Bloom said of Mr Dedalus senior, in more respects than\r\none and a born raconteur if ever there was one. He takes great pride,\r\nquite legitimate, out of you. You could go back perhaps, he hasarded,\r\nstill thinking of the very unpleasant scene at Westland Row terminus\r\nwhen it was perfectly evident that the other two, Mulligan, that is, and\r\nthat English tourist friend of his, who eventually euchred their third\r\ncompanion, were patently trying as if the whole bally station belonged\r\nto them to give Stephen the slip in the confusion, which they did.\r\n\r\nThere was no response forthcoming to the suggestion however, such as it\r\nwas, Stephen\xe2\x80\x99s mind\xe2\x80\x99s eye being too busily engaged in repicturing his\r\nfamily hearth the last time he saw it with his sister Dilly sitting by\r\nthe ingle, her hair hanging down, waiting for some weak Trinidad shell\r\ncocoa that was in the sootcoated kettle to be done so that she and he\r\ncould drink it with the oatmealwater for milk after the Friday herrings\r\nthey had eaten at two a penny with an egg apiece for Maggy, Boody and\r\nKatey, the cat meanwhile under the mangle devouring a mess of eggshells\r\nand charred fish heads and bones on a square of brown paper, in\r\naccordance with the third precept of the church to fast and abstain\r\non the days commanded, it being quarter tense or if not, ember days or\r\nsomething like that.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94No, Mr Bloom repeated again, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t personally repose much trust\r\nin that boon companion of yours who contributes the humorous element, Dr\r\nMulligan, as a guide, philosopher and friend if I were in your shoes. He\r\nknows which side his bread is buttered on though in all probability he\r\nnever realised what it is to be without regular meals. Of course you\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t notice as much as I did. But it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t occasion me the least\r\nsurprise to learn that a pinch of tobacco or some narcotic was put in\r\nyour drink for some ulterior object.\r\n\r\nHe understood however from all he heard that Dr Mulligan was a versatile\r\nallround man, by no means confined to medicine only, who was rapidly\r\ncoming to the fore in his line and, if the report was verified, bade\r\nfair to enjoy a flourishing practice in the not too distant future as\r\na tony medical practitioner drawing a handsome fee for his services\r\nin addition to which professional status his rescue of that man from\r\ncertain drowning by artificial respiration and what they call first\r\naid at Skerries, or Malahide was it?, was, he was bound to admit, an\r\nexceedingly plucky deed which he could not too highly praise, so that\r\nfrankly he was utterly at a loss to fathom what earthly reason could be\r\nat the back of it except he put it down to sheer cussedness or jealousy,\r\npure and simple.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Except it simply amounts to one thing and he is what they call picking\r\nyour brains, he ventured to throw out.\r\n\r\nThe guarded glance of half solicitude half curiosity augmented by\r\nfriendliness which he gave at Stephen\xe2\x80\x99s at present morose expression\r\nof features did not throw a flood of light, none at all in fact on the\r\nproblem as to whether he had let himself be badly bamboozled to judge by\r\ntwo or three lowspirited remarks he let drop or the other way about saw\r\nthrough the affair and for some reason or other best known to himself\r\nallowed matters to more or less. Grinding poverty did have that effect\r\nand he more than conjectured that, high educational abilities though he\r\npossessed, he experienced no little difficulty in making both ends meet.\r\n\r\nAdjacent to the men\xe2\x80\x99s public urinal they perceived an icecream car round\r\nwhich a group of presumably Italians in heated altercation were getting\r\nrid of voluble expressions in their vivacious language in a particularly\r\nanimated way, there being some little differences between the parties.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Puttana madonna, che ci dia i quattrini! Ho ragione? Culo rotto!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Intendiamoci. Mezzo sovrano pi\xc3\xb9...\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Dice lui, per\xc3\xb2!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Mezzo.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Farabutto! Mortacci sui!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Ma ascolta! Cinque la testa pi\xc3\xb9...\r\n\r\nMr Bloom and Stephen entered the cabman\xe2\x80\x99s shelter, an unpretentious\r\nwooden structure, where, prior to then, he had rarely if ever been\r\nbefore, the former having previously whispered to the latter a few\r\nhints anent the keeper of it said to be the once famous Skin-the-Goat\r\nFitzharris, the invincible, though he could not vouch for the actual\r\nfacts which quite possibly there was not one vestige of truth in. A few\r\nmoments later saw our two noctambules safely seated in a discreet corner\r\nonly to be greeted by stares from the decidedly miscellaneous collection\r\nof waifs and strays and other nondescript specimens of the genus homo\r\nalready there engaged in eating and drinking diversified by conversation\r\nfor whom they seemingly formed an object of marked curiosity.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Now touching a cup of coffee, Mr Bloom ventured to plausibly suggest\r\nto break the ice, it occurs to me you ought to sample something in the\r\nshape of solid food, say, a roll of some description.\r\n\r\nAccordingly his first act was with characteristic sangfroid to order\r\nthese commodities quietly. The hoi polloi of jarvies or stevedores\r\nor whatever they were after a cursory examination turned their eyes\r\napparently dissatisfied, away though one redbearded bibulous individual,\r\nportion of whose hair was greyish, a sailor probably, still stared for\r\nsome appreciable time before transferring his rapt attention to the\r\nfloor. Mr Bloom, availing himself of the right of free speech, he having\r\njust a bowing acquaintance with the language in dispute, though, to be\r\nsure, rather in a quandary over voglio, remarked to his prot\xc3\xa9g\xc3\xa9 in an\r\naudible tone of voice \xc3\xa0 propos of the battle royal in the street which\r\nwas still raging fast and furious:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94A beautiful language. I mean for singing purposes. Why do you not write\r\nyour poetry in that language? Bella Poetria! It is so melodious and\r\nfull. Belladonna. Voglio.\r\n\r\nStephen, who was trying his dead best to yawn if he could, suffering\r\nfrom lassitude generally, replied:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94To fill the ear of a cow elephant. They were haggling over money.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Is that so? Mr Bloom asked. Of course, he subjoined pensively, at the\r\ninward reflection of there being more languages to start with than were\r\nabsolutely necessary, it may be only the southern glamour that surrounds\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThe keeper of the shelter in the middle of this t\xc3\xaate-\xc3\xa0-t\xc3\xaate put a\r\nboiling swimming cup of a choice concoction labelled coffee on the table\r\nand a rather antediluvian specimen of a bun, or so it seemed. After\r\nwhich he beat a retreat to his counter, Mr Bloom determining to have\r\na good square look at him later on so as not to appear to. For which\r\nreason he encouraged Stephen to proceed with his eyes while he did\r\nthe honours by surreptitiously pushing the cup of what was temporarily\r\nsupposed to be called coffee gradually nearer him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Sounds are impostures, Stephen said after a pause of some little time,\r\nlike names. Cicero, Podmore, Napoleon, Mr Goodbody. Jesus, Mr Doyle.\r\nShakespeares were as common as Murphies. What\xe2\x80\x99s in a name?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Yes, to be sure, Mr Bloom unaffectedly concurred. Of course. Our name\r\nwas changed too, he added, pushing the socalled roll across.\r\n\r\nThe redbearded sailor who had his weather eye on the newcomers boarded\r\nStephen, whom he had singled out for attention in particular, squarely\r\nby asking:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94And what might your name be?\r\n\r\nJust in the nick of time Mr Bloom touched his companion\xe2\x80\x99s boot but\r\nStephen, apparently disregarding the warm pressure from an unexpected\r\nquarter, answered:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Dedalus.\r\n\r\nThe sailor stared at him heavily from a pair of drowsy baggy eyes,\r\nrather bunged up from excessive use of boose, preferably good old\r\nHollands and water.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94You know Simon Dedalus? he asked at length.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard of him, Stephen said.\r\n\r\nMr Bloom was all at sea for a moment, seeing the others evidently\r\neavesdropping too.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94He\xe2\x80\x99s Irish, the seaman bold affirmed, staring still in much the same\r\nway and nodding. All Irish.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94All too Irish, Stephen rejoined.\r\n\r\nAs for Mr Bloom he could neither make head or tail of the whole business\r\nand he was just asking himself what possible connection when the sailor\r\nof his own accord turned to the other occupants of the shelter with the\r\nremark:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I seen him shoot two eggs off two bottles at fifty yards over his\r\nshoulder. The lefthand dead shot.\r\n\r\nThough he was slightly hampered by an occasional stammer and his\r\ngestures being also clumsy as it was still he did his best to explain.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Bottles out there, say. Fifty yards measured. Eggs on the bottles.\r\nCocks his gun over his shoulder. Aims.\r\n\r\nHe turned his body half round, shut up his right eye completely. Then he\r\nscrewed his features up someway sideways and glared out into the night\r\nwith an unprepossessing cast of countenance.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Pom! he then shouted once.\r\n\r\nThe entire audience waited, anticipating an additional detonation, there\r\nbeing still a further egg.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Pom! he shouted twice.\r\n\r\nEgg two evidently demolished, he nodded and winked, adding\r\nbloodthirstily:\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x94Buffalo Bill shoots to kill,\r\n      Never missed nor he never will.\r\n\r\nA silence ensued till Mr Bloom for agreeableness\xe2\x80\x99 sake just felt like\r\nasking him whether it was for a marksmanship competition like the\r\nBisley.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Beg pardon, the sailor said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Long ago? Mr Bloom pursued without flinching a hairsbreadth.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Why, the sailor replied, relaxing to a certain extent under the magic\r\ninfluence of diamond cut diamond, it might be a matter of ten years. He\r\ntoured the wide world with Hengler\xe2\x80\x99s Royal Circus. I seen him do that in\r\nStockholm.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Curious coincidence, Mr Bloom confided to Stephen unobtrusively.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Murphy\xe2\x80\x99s my name, the sailor continued. D. B. Murphy of Carrigaloe.\r\nKnow where that is?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Queenstown harbour, Stephen replied.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94That\xe2\x80\x99s right, the sailor said. Fort Camden and Fort Carlisle. That\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwhere I hails from. I belongs there. That\xe2\x80\x99s where I hails from. My\r\nlittle woman\xe2\x80\x99s down there. She\xe2\x80\x99s waiting for me, I know. For England,\r\nhome and beauty. She\xe2\x80\x99s my own true wife I haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen for seven years\r\nnow, sailing about.\r\n\r\nMr Bloom could easily picture his advent on this scene, the homecoming\r\nto the mariner\xe2\x80\x99s roadside shieling after having diddled Davy Jones,\r\na rainy night with a blind moon. Across the world for a wife. Quite a\r\nnumber of stories there were on that particular Alice Ben Bolt topic,\r\nEnoch Arden and Rip van Winkle and does anybody hereabouts remember Caoc\r\nO\xe2\x80\x99Leary, a favourite and most trying declamation piece by the way of\r\npoor John Casey and a bit of perfect poetry in its own small way.\r\nNever about the runaway wife coming back, however much devoted to the\r\nabsentee. The face at the window! Judge of his astonishment when he\r\nfinally did breast the tape and the awful truth dawned upon him anent\r\nhis better half, wrecked in his affections. You little expected me but\r\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve come to stay and make a fresh start. There she sits, a grasswidow,\r\nat the selfsame fireside. Believes me dead, rocked in the cradle of the\r\ndeep. And there sits uncle Chubb or Tomkin, as the case might be, the\r\npublican of the Crown and Anchor, in shirtsleeves, eating rumpsteak and\r\nonions. No chair for father. Broo! The wind! Her brandnew arrival is\r\non her knee, post mortem child. With a high ro! and a randy ro! and my\r\ngalloping tearing tandy, O! Bow to the inevitable. Grin and bear it. I\r\nremain with much love your brokenhearted husband D B Murphy.\r\n\r\nThe sailor, who scarcely seemed to be a Dublin resident, turned to one\r\nof the jarvies with the request:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94You don\xe2\x80\x99t happen to have such a thing as a spare chaw about you?\r\n\r\nThe jarvey addressed as it happened had not but the keeper took a die of\r\nplug from his good jacket hanging on a nail and the desired object was\r\npassed from hand to hand.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Thank you, the sailor said.\r\n\r\nHe deposited the quid in his gob and, chewing and with some slow\r\nstammers, proceeded:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94We come up this morning eleven o\xe2\x80\x99clock. The threemaster Rosevean from\r\nBridgwater with bricks. I shipped to get over. Paid off this afternoon.\r\nThere\xe2\x80\x99s my discharge. See? D. B. Murphy. A. B. S.\r\n\r\nIn confirmation of which statement he extricated from an inside pocket\r\nand handed to his neighbour a not very cleanlooking folded document.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94You must have seen a fair share of the world, the keeper remarked,\r\nleaning on the counter.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Why, the sailor answered upon reflection upon it, I\xe2\x80\x99ve circumnavigated\r\na bit since I first joined on. I was in the Red Sea. I was in China and\r\nNorth America and South America. We was chased by pirates one voyage.\r\nI seen icebergs plenty, growlers. I was in Stockholm and the Black Sea,\r\nthe Dardanelles under Captain Dalton, the best bloody man that ever\r\nscuttled a ship. I seen Russia. Gospodi pomilyou. That\xe2\x80\x99s how the\r\nRussians prays.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94You seen queer sights, don\xe2\x80\x99t be talking, put in a jarvey.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Why, the sailor said, shifting his partially chewed plug. I seen queer\r\nthings too, ups and downs. I seen a crocodile bite the fluke of an\r\nanchor same as I chew that quid.\r\n\r\nHe took out of his mouth the pulpy quid and, lodging it between his\r\nteeth, bit ferociously:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Khaan! Like that. And I seen maneaters in Peru that eats corpses and\r\nthe livers of horses. Look here. Here they are. A friend of mine sent\r\nme.\r\n\r\nHe fumbled out a picture postcard from his inside pocket which seemed to\r\nbe in its way a species of repository and pushed it along the table. The\r\nprinted matter on it stated: Choza de Indios. Beni, Bolivia.\r\n\r\nAll focussed their attention at the scene exhibited, a group of savage\r\nwomen in striped loincloths, squatted, blinking, suckling, frowning,\r\nsleeping amid a swarm of infants (there must have been quite a score of\r\nthem) outside some primitive shanties of osier.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Chews coca all day, the communicative tarpaulin added. Stomachs like\r\nbreadgraters. Cuts off their diddies when they can\xe2\x80\x99t bear no more\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\nSee them sitting there stark ballocknaked eating a dead horse\xe2\x80\x99s liver\r\nraw.\r\n\r\nHis postcard proved a centre of attraction for Messrs the greenhorns for\r\nseveral minutes if not more.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Know how to keep them off? he inquired generally.\r\n\r\nNobody volunteering a statement he winked, saying:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Glass. That boggles \xe2\x80\x98em. Glass.\r\n\r\nMr Bloom, without evincing surprise, unostentatiously turned over the\r\ncard to peruse the partially obliterated address and postmark. It ran\r\nas follows: Tarjeta Postal, Se\xc3\xb1or A Boudin, Galeria Becche, Santiago,\r\nChile. There was no message evidently, as he took particular notice.\r\nThough not an implicit believer in the lurid story narrated (or the\r\neggsniping transaction for that matter despite William Tell and the\r\nLazarillo-Don Cesar de Bazan incident depicted in Maritana on which\r\noccasion the former\xe2\x80\x99s ball passed through the latter\xe2\x80\x99s hat) having\r\ndetected a discrepancy between his name (assuming he was the person\r\nhe represented himself to be and not sailing under false colours\r\nafter having boxed the compass on the strict q.t. somewhere) and\r\nthe fictitious addressee of the missive which made him nourish some\r\nsuspicions of our friend\xe2\x80\x99s bona fides nevertheless it reminded him in a\r\nway of a longcherished plan he meant to one day realise some Wednesday\r\nor Saturday of travelling to London via long sea not to say that he had\r\never travelled extensively to any great extent but he was at heart a\r\nborn adventurer though by a trick of fate he had consistently remained\r\na landlubber except you call going to Holyhead which was his longest.\r\nMartin Cunningham frequently said he would work a pass through Egan but\r\nsome deuced hitch or other eternally cropped up with the net result that\r\nthe scheme fell through. But even suppose it did come to planking\r\ndown the needful and breaking Boyd\xe2\x80\x99s heart it was not so dear, purse\r\npermitting, a few guineas at the outside considering the fare to\r\nMullingar where he figured on going was five and six, there and back.\r\nThe trip would benefit health on account of the bracing ozone and be in\r\nevery way thoroughly pleasurable, especially for a chap whose liver was\r\nout of order, seeing the different places along the route, Plymouth,\r\nFalmouth, Southampton and so on culminating in an instructive tour of\r\nthe sights of the great metropolis, the spectacle of our modern Babylon\r\nwhere doubtless he would see the greatest improvement, tower, abbey,\r\nwealth of Park lane to renew acquaintance with. Another thing just\r\nstruck him as a by no means bad notion was he might have a gaze around\r\non the spot to see about trying to make arrangements about a concert\r\ntour of summer music embracing the most prominent pleasure resorts,\r\nMargate with mixed bathing and firstrate hydros and spas, Eastbourne,\r\nScarborough, Margate and so on, beautiful Bournemouth, the Channel\r\nislands and similar bijou spots, which might prove highly remunerative.\r\nNot, of course, with a hole and corner scratch company or local ladies\r\non the job, witness Mrs C P M\xe2\x80\x99Coy type lend me your valise and I\xe2\x80\x99ll post\r\nyou the ticket. No, something top notch, an all star Irish caste, the\r\nTweedy-Flower grand opera company with his own legal consort as leading\r\nlady as a sort of counterblast to the Elster Grimes and Moody-Manners,\r\nperfectly simple matter and he was quite sanguine of success, providing\r\npuffs in the local papers could be managed by some fellow with a bit of\r\nbounce who could pull the indispensable wires and thus combine business\r\nwith pleasure. But who? That was the rub.\r\n\r\nAlso, without being actually positive, it struck him a great field was\r\nto be opened up in the line of opening up new routes to keep pace with\r\nthe times apropos of the Fishguard-Rosslare route which, it was mooted,\r\nwas once more on the tapis in the circumlocution departments with the\r\nusual quantity of red tape and dillydallying of effete fogeydom and\r\ndunderheads generally. A great opportunity there certainly was for push\r\nand enterprise to meet the travelling needs of the public at large, the\r\naverage man, i.e. Brown, Robinson and Co.\r\n\r\nIt was a subject of regret and absurd as well on the face of it and no\r\nsmall blame to our vaunted society that the man in the street, when the\r\nsystem really needed toning up, for the matter of a couple of paltry\r\npounds was debarred from seeing more of the world they lived in instead\r\nof being always and ever cooped up since my old stick-in-the-mud took me\r\nfor a wife. After all, hang it, they had their eleven and more humdrum\r\nmonths of it and merited a radical change of venue after the grind\r\nof city life in the summertime for choice when dame Nature is at her\r\nspectacular best constituting nothing short of a new lease of life.\r\nThere were equally excellent opportunities for vacationists in the home\r\nisland, delightful sylvan spots for rejuvenation, offering a plethora\r\nof attractions as well as a bracing tonic for the system in and around\r\nDublin and its picturesque environs even, Poulaphouca to which there was\r\na steamtram, but also farther away from the madding crowd in Wicklow,\r\nrightly termed the garden of Ireland, an ideal neighbourhood for elderly\r\nwheelmen so long as it didn\xe2\x80\x99t come down, and in the wilds of Donegal\r\nwhere if report spoke true the coup d\xe2\x80\x99\xc5\x93il was exceedingly grand though\r\nthe lastnamed locality was not easily getatable so that the influx of\r\nvisitors was not as yet all that it might be considering the\r\nsignal benefits to be derived from it while Howth with its historic\r\nassociations and otherwise, Silken Thomas, Grace O\xe2\x80\x99Malley, George IV,\r\nrhododendrons several hundred feet above sealevel was a favourite haunt\r\nwith all sorts and conditions of men especially in the spring when young\r\nmen\xe2\x80\x99s fancy, though it had its own toll of deaths by falling off the\r\ncliffs by design or accidentally, usually, by the way, on their left\r\nleg, it being only about three quarters of an hour\xe2\x80\x99s run from the\r\npillar. Because of course uptodate tourist travelling was as yet merely\r\nin its infancy, so to speak, and the accommodation left much to be\r\ndesired. Interesting to fathom it seemed to him from a motive of\r\ncuriosity, pure and simple, was whether it was the traffic that created\r\nthe route or viceversa or the two sides in fact. He turned back the\r\nother side of the card, picture, and passed it along to Stephen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I seen a Chinese one time, related the doughty narrator, that had\r\nlittle pills like putty and he put them in the water and they opened and\r\nevery pill was something different. One was a ship, another was a house,\r\nanother was a flower. Cooks rats in your soup, he appetisingly added,\r\nthe chinks does.\r\n\r\nPossibly perceiving an expression of dubiosity on their faces the\r\nglobetrotter went on, adhering to his adventures.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94And I seen a man killed in Trieste by an Italian chap. Knife in his\r\nback. Knife like that.\r\n\r\nWhilst speaking he produced a dangerouslooking claspknife quite in\r\nkeeping with his character and held it in the striking position.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94In a knockingshop it was count of a tryon between two smugglers. Fellow\r\nhid behind a door, come up behind him. Like that. Prepare to meet your\r\nGod, says he. Chuk! It went into his back up to the butt.\r\n\r\nHis heavy glance drowsily roaming about kind of defied their further\r\nquestions even should they by any chance want to.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94That\xe2\x80\x99s a good bit of steel, repeated he, examining his formidable\r\nstiletto.\r\n\r\nAfter which harrowing d\xc3\xa9nouement sufficient to appal the stoutest he\r\nsnapped the blade to and stowed the weapon in question away as before in\r\nhis chamber of horrors, otherwise pocket.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94They\xe2\x80\x99re great for the cold steel, somebody who was evidently quite in\r\nthe dark said for the benefit of them all. That was why they thought\r\nthe park murders of the invincibles was done by foreigners on account of\r\nthem using knives.\r\n\r\nAt this remark passed obviously in the spirit of where ignorance\r\nis bliss Mr B. and Stephen, each in his own particular way, both\r\ninstinctively exchanged meaning glances, in a religious silence of the\r\nstrictly entre nous variety however, towards where Skin-the-Goat, alias\r\nthe keeper, not turning a hair, was drawing spurts of liquid from his\r\nboiler affair. His inscrutable face which was really a work of art, a\r\nperfect study in itself, beggaring description, conveyed the impression\r\nthat he didn\xe2\x80\x99t understand one jot of what was going on. Funny, very!\r\n\r\nThere ensued a somewhat lengthy pause. One man was reading in fits and\r\nstarts a stained by coffee evening journal, another the card with the\r\nnatives choza de, another the seaman\xe2\x80\x99s discharge. Mr Bloom, so far as he\r\nwas personally concerned, was just pondering in pensive mood. He\r\nvividly recollected when the occurrence alluded to took place as well\r\nas yesterday, roughly some score of years previously in the days of the\r\nland troubles, when it took the civilised world by storm, figuratively\r\nspeaking, early in the eighties, eightyone to be correct, when he was\r\njust turned fifteen.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Ay, boss, the sailor broke in. Give us back them papers.\r\n\r\nThe request being complied with he clawed them up with a scrape.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Have you seen the rock of Gibraltar? Mr Bloom inquired.\r\n\r\nThe sailor grimaced, chewing, in a way that might be read as yes, ay or\r\nno.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Ah, you\xe2\x80\x99ve touched there too, Mr Bloom said, Europa point, thinking he\r\nhad, in the hope that the rover might possibly by some reminiscences but\r\nhe failed to do so, simply letting spirt a jet of spew into the sawdust,\r\nand shook his head with a sort of lazy scorn.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94What year would that be about? Mr B interrogated. Can you recall the\r\nboats?\r\n\r\nOur soi-disant sailor munched heavily awhile hungrily before answering:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99m tired of all them rocks in the sea, he said, and boats and ships.\r\nSalt junk all the time.\r\n\r\nTired seemingly, he ceased. His questioner perceiving that he was not\r\nlikely to get a great deal of change out of such a wily old customer,\r\nfell to woolgathering on the enormous dimensions of the water about the\r\nglobe, suffice it to say that, as a casual glance at the map revealed,\r\nit covered fully three fourths of it and he fully realised accordingly\r\nwhat it meant to rule the waves. On more than one occasion, a dozen\r\nat the lowest, near the North Bull at Dollymount he had remarked a\r\nsuperannuated old salt, evidently derelict, seated habitually near the\r\nnot particularly redolent sea on the wall, staring quite obliviously at\r\nit and it at him, dreaming of fresh woods and pastures new as someone\r\nsomewhere sings. And it left him wondering why. Possibly he had tried to\r\nfind out the secret for himself, floundering up and down the antipodes\r\nand all that sort of thing and over and under, well, not exactly under,\r\ntempting the fates. And the odds were twenty to nil there was really no\r\nsecret about it at all. Nevertheless, without going into the minutiae of\r\nthe business, the eloquent fact remained that the sea was there in all\r\nits glory and in the natural course of things somebody or other had to\r\nsail on it and fly in the face of providence though it merely went to\r\nshow how people usually contrived to load that sort of onus on to the\r\nother fellow like the hell idea and the lottery and insurance which were\r\nrun on identically the same lines so that for that very reason if no\r\nother lifeboat Sunday was a highly laudable institution to which the\r\npublic at large, no matter where living inland or seaside, as the case\r\nmight be, having it brought home to them like that should extend its\r\ngratitude also to the harbourmasters and coastguard service who had\r\nto man the rigging and push off and out amid the elements whatever the\r\nseason when duty called Ireland expects that every man and so on and\r\nsometimes had a terrible time of it in the wintertime not forgetting the\r\nIrish lights, Kish and others, liable to capsize at any moment, rounding\r\nwhich he once with his daughter had experienced some remarkably choppy,\r\nnot to say stormy, weather.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94There was a fellow sailed with me in the Rover, the old seadog, himself\r\na rover, proceeded, went ashore and took up a soft job as gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nvalet at six quid a month. Them are his trousers I\xe2\x80\x99ve on me and he gave\r\nme an oilskin and that jackknife. I\xe2\x80\x99m game for that job, shaving and\r\nbrushup. I hate roaming about. There\xe2\x80\x99s my son now, Danny, run off to\r\nsea and his mother got him took in a draper\xe2\x80\x99s in Cork where he could be\r\ndrawing easy money.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94What age is he? queried one hearer who, by the way, seen from the side,\r\nbore a distant resemblance to Henry Campbell, the townclerk, away from\r\nthe carking cares of office, unwashed of course and in a seedy getup and\r\na strong suspicion of nosepaint about the nasal appendage.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Why, the sailor answered with a slow puzzled utterance, my son, Danny?\r\nHe\xe2\x80\x99d be about eighteen now, way I figure it.\r\n\r\nThe Skibbereen father hereupon tore open his grey or unclean anyhow\r\nshirt with his two hands and scratched away at his chest on which was to\r\nbe seen an image tattooed in blue Chinese ink intended to represent an\r\nanchor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94There was lice in that bunk in Bridgwater, he remarked, sure as nuts. I\r\nmust get a wash tomorrow or next day. It\xe2\x80\x99s them black lads I objects to.\r\nI hate those buggers. Suck your blood dry, they does.\r\n\r\nSeeing they were all looking at his chest he accommodatingly dragged\r\nhis shirt more open so that on top of the timehonoured symbol of the\r\nmariner\xe2\x80\x99s hope and rest they had a full view of the figure 16 and a\r\nyoung man\xe2\x80\x99s sideface looking frowningly rather.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Tattoo, the exhibitor explained. That was done when we were Iying\r\nbecalmed off Odessa in the Black Sea under Captain Dalton. Fellow, the\r\nname of Antonio, done that. There he is himself, a Greek.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Did it hurt much doing it? one asked the sailor.\r\n\r\nThat worthy, however, was busily engaged in collecting round the.\r\nSomeway in his. Squeezing or.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94See here, he said, showing Antonio. There he is cursing the mate. And\r\nthere he is now, he added, the same fellow, pulling the skin with his\r\nfingers, some special knack evidently, and he laughing at a yarn.\r\n\r\nAnd in point of fact the young man named Antonio\xe2\x80\x99s livid face did\r\nactually look like forced smiling and the curious effect excited the\r\nunreserved admiration of everybody including Skin-the-Goat, who this\r\ntime stretched over.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Ay, ay, sighed the sailor, looking down on his manly chest. He\xe2\x80\x99s gone\r\ntoo. Ate by sharks after. Ay, ay.\r\n\r\nHe let go of the skin so that the profile resumed the normal expression\r\nof before.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Neat bit of work, one longshoreman said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94And what\xe2\x80\x99s the number for? loafer number two queried.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Eaten alive? a third asked the sailor.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Ay, ay, sighed again the latter personage, more cheerily this time with\r\nsome sort of a half smile for a brief duration only in the direction of\r\nthe questioner about the number. Ate. A Greek he was.\r\n\r\nAnd then he added with rather gallowsbird humour considering his alleged\r\nend:\r\n\r\n      \xe2\x80\x94As bad as old Antonio,\r\n      For he left me on my ownio.\r\n\r\nThe face of a streetwalker glazed and haggard under a black straw hat\r\npeered askew round the door of the shelter palpably reconnoitring on\r\nher own with the object of bringing more grist to her mill. Mr\r\nBloom, scarcely knowing which way to look, turned away on the moment\r\nflusterfied but outwardly calm, and, picking up from the table the pink\r\nsheet of the Abbey street organ which the jarvey, if such he was, had\r\nlaid aside, he picked it up and looked at the pink of the paper though\r\nwhy pink. His reason for so doing was he recognised on the moment\r\nround the door the same face he had caught a fleeting glimpse of that\r\nafternoon on Ormond quay, the partially idiotic female, namely, of the\r\nlane who knew the lady in the brown costume does be with you (Mrs B.)\r\nand begged the chance of his washing. Also why washing which seemed\r\nrather vague than not, your washing. Still candour compelled him to\r\nadmit he had washed his wife\xe2\x80\x99s undergarments when soiled in Holles\r\nstreet and women would and did too a man\xe2\x80\x99s similar garments initialled\r\nwith Bewley and Draper\xe2\x80\x99s marking ink (hers were, that is) if they really\r\nloved him, that is to say, love me, love my dirty shirt. Still just\r\nthen, being on tenterhooks, he desired the female\xe2\x80\x99s room more than her\r\ncompany so it came as a genuine relief when the keeper made her a rude\r\nsign to take herself off. Round the side of the Evening Telegraph he\r\njust caught a fleeting glimpse of her face round the side of the door\r\nwith a kind of demented glassy grin showing that she was not exactly all\r\nthere, viewing with evident amusement the group of gazers round skipper\r\nMurphy\xe2\x80\x99s nautical chest and then there was no more of her.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94The gunboat, the keeper said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94It beats me, Mr Bloom confided to Stephen, medically I am speaking,\r\nhow a wretched creature like that from the Lock hospital reeking with\r\ndisease can be barefaced enough to solicit or how any man in his sober\r\nsenses, if he values his health in the least. Unfortunate creature! Of\r\ncourse I suppose some man is ultimately responsible for her condition.\r\nStill no matter what the cause is from...\r\n\r\nStephen had not noticed her and shrugged his shoulders, merely\r\nremarking:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94In this country people sell much more than she ever had and do a\r\nroaring trade. Fear not them that sell the body but have not power to\r\nbuy the soul. She is a bad merchant. She buys dear and sells cheap.\r\n\r\nThe elder man, though not by any manner of means an old maid or a prude,\r\nsaid it was nothing short of a crying scandal that ought to be put a\r\nstop to instanter to say that women of that stamp (quite apart from any\r\noldmaidish squeamishness on the subject), a necessary evil, were not\r\nlicensed and medically inspected by the proper authorities, a thing, he\r\ncould truthfully state, he, as a paterfamilias, was a stalwart advocate\r\nof from the very first start. Whoever embarked on a policy of the sort,\r\nhe said, and ventilated the matter thoroughly would confer a lasting\r\nboon on everybody concerned.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94You as a good catholic, he observed, talking of body and soul, believe\r\nin the soul. Or do you mean the intelligence, the brainpower as such,\r\nas distinct from any outside object, the table, let us say, that cup. I\r\nbelieve in that myself because it has been explained by competent men as\r\nthe convolutions of the grey matter. Otherwise we would never have such\r\ninventions as X rays, for instance. Do you?\r\n\r\nThus cornered, Stephen had to make a superhuman effort of memory to try\r\nand concentrate and remember before he could say:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94They tell me on the best authority it is a simple substance and\r\ntherefore incorruptible. It would be immortal, I understand, but for the\r\npossibility of its annihilation by its First Cause Who, from all I\r\ncan hear, is quite capable of adding that to the number of His other\r\npractical jokes, corruptio per se and corruptio per accidens both being\r\nexcluded by court etiquette.\r\n\r\nMr Bloom thoroughly acquiesced in the general gist of this though the\r\nmystical finesse involved was a bit out of his sublunary depth still\r\nhe felt bound to enter a demurrer on the head of simple, promptly\r\nrejoining:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Simple? I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t think that is the proper word. Of course, I grant\r\nyou, to concede a point, you do knock across a simple soul once in a\r\nblue moon. But what I am anxious to arrive at is it is one thing for\r\ninstance to invent those rays R\xc3\xb6ntgen did or the telescope like Edison,\r\nthough I believe it was before his time Galileo was the man, I mean,\r\nand the same applies to the laws, for example, of a farreaching natural\r\nphenomenon such as electricity but it\xe2\x80\x99s a horse of quite another colour\r\nto say you believe in the existence of a supernatural God.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94O that, Stephen expostulated, has been proved conclusively by several\r\nof the bestknown passages in Holy Writ, apart from circumstantial\r\nevidence.\r\n\r\nOn this knotty point however the views of the pair, poles apart as they\r\nwere both in schooling and everything else with the marked difference in\r\ntheir respective ages, clashed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Has been? the more experienced of the two objected, sticking to his\r\noriginal point with a smile of unbelief. I\xe2\x80\x99m not so sure about that.\r\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s a matter for everyman\xe2\x80\x99s opinion and, without dragging in the\r\nsectarian side of the business, I beg to differ with you in toto there.\r\nMy belief is, to tell you the candid truth, that those bits were genuine\r\nforgeries all of them put in by monks most probably or it\xe2\x80\x99s the big\r\nquestion of our national poet over again, who precisely wrote them like\r\nHamlet and Bacon, as, you who know your Shakespeare infinitely better\r\nthan I, of course I needn\xe2\x80\x99t tell you. Can\xe2\x80\x99t you drink that coffee, by\r\nthe way? Let me stir it. And take a piece of that bun. It\xe2\x80\x99s like one\r\nof our skipper\xe2\x80\x99s bricks disguised. Still no-one can give what he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\ngot. Try a bit.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Couldn\xe2\x80\x99t, Stephen contrived to get out, his mental organs for the\r\nmoment refusing to dictate further.\r\n\r\nFaultfinding being a proverbially bad hat Mr Bloom thought well to stir\r\nor try to the clotted sugar from the bottom and reflected with something\r\napproaching acrimony on the Coffee Palace and its temperance (and\r\nlucrative) work. To be sure it was a legitimate object and beyond yea or\r\nnay did a world of good, shelters such as the present one they were in\r\nrun on teetotal lines for vagrants at night, concerts, dramatic evenings\r\nand useful lectures (admittance free) by qualified men for the lower\r\norders. On the other hand he had a distinct and painful recollection\r\nthey paid his wife, Madam Marion Tweedy who had been prominently\r\nassociated with it at one time, a very modest remuneration indeed for\r\nher pianoplaying. The idea, he was strongly inclined to believe, was\r\nto do good and net a profit, there being no competition to speak\r\nof. Sulphate of copper poison SO4 or something in some dried peas he\r\nremembered reading of in a cheap eatinghouse somewhere but he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nremember when it was or where. Anyhow inspection, medical inspection,\r\nof all eatables seemed to him more than ever necessary which possibly\r\naccounted for the vogue of Dr Tibble\xe2\x80\x99s Vi-Cocoa on account of the\r\nmedical analysis involved.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Have a shot at it now, he ventured to say of the coffee after being\r\nstirred.\r\n\r\nThus prevailed on to at any rate taste it Stephen lifted the heavy mug\r\nfrom the brown puddle it clopped out of when taken up by the handle and\r\ntook a sip of the offending beverage.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Still it\xe2\x80\x99s solid food, his good genius urged, I\xe2\x80\x99m a stickler for solid\r\nfood, his one and only reason being not gormandising in the least but\r\nregular meals as the sine qua non for any kind of proper work, mental\r\nor manual. You ought to eat more solid food. You would feel a different\r\nman.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Liquids I can eat, Stephen said. But O, oblige me by taking away that\r\nknife. I can\xe2\x80\x99t look at the point of it. It reminds me of Roman history.\r\n\r\nMr Bloom promptly did as suggested and removed the incriminated article,\r\na blunt hornhandled ordinary knife with nothing particularly Roman or\r\nantique about it to the lay eye, observing that the point was the least\r\nconspicuous point about it.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Our mutual friend\xe2\x80\x99s stories are like himself, Mr Bloom apropos of\r\nknives remarked to his confidante sotto voce. Do you think they are\r\ngenuine? He could spin those yarns for hours on end all night long and\r\nlie like old boots. Look at him.\r\n\r\nYet still though his eyes were thick with sleep and sea air life was\r\nfull of a host of things and coincidences of a terrible nature and it\r\nwas quite within the bounds of possibility that it was not an\r\nentire fabrication though at first blush there was not much inherent\r\nprobability in all the spoof he got off his chest being strictly\r\naccurate gospel.\r\n\r\nHe had been meantime taking stock of the individual in front of him and\r\nSherlockholmesing him up ever since he clapped eyes on him. Though a\r\nwellpreserved man of no little stamina, if a trifle prone to baldness,\r\nthere was something spurious in the cut of his jib that suggested a jail\r\ndelivery and it required no violent stretch of imagination to associate\r\nsuch a weirdlooking specimen with the oakum and treadmill fraternity. He\r\nmight even have done for his man supposing it was his own case he told,\r\nas people often did about others, namely, that he killed him himself\r\nand had served his four or five goodlooking years in durance vile to say\r\nnothing of the Antonio personage (no relation to the dramatic personage\r\nof identical name who sprang from the pen of our national poet) who\r\nexpiated his crimes in the melodramatic manner above described. On the\r\nother hand he might be only bluffing, a pardonable weakness because\r\nmeeting unmistakable mugs, Dublin residents, like those jarvies waiting\r\nnews from abroad would tempt any ancient mariner who sailed the ocean\r\nseas to draw the long bow about the schooner Hesperus and etcetera. And\r\nwhen all was said and done the lies a fellow told about himself couldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nprobably hold a proverbial candle to the wholesale whoppers other\r\nfellows coined about him.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Mind you, I\xe2\x80\x99m not saying that it\xe2\x80\x99s all a pure invention, he resumed.\r\nAnalogous scenes are occasionally, if not often, met with. Giants,\r\nthough that is rather a far cry, you see once in a way, Marcella the\r\nmidget queen. In those waxworks in Henry street I myself saw some\r\nAztecs, as they are called, sitting bowlegged, they couldn\xe2\x80\x99t straighten\r\ntheir legs if you paid them because the muscles here, you see, he\r\nproceeded, indicating on his companion the brief outline of the sinews\r\nor whatever you like to call them behind the right knee, were utterly\r\npowerless from sitting that way so long cramped up, being adored as\r\ngods. There\xe2\x80\x99s an example again of simple souls.\r\n\r\nHowever reverting to friend Sinbad and his horrifying adventures (who\r\nreminded him a bit of Ludwig, alias Ledwidge, when he occupied\r\nthe boards of the Gaiety when Michael Gunn was identified with the\r\nmanagement in the Flying Dutchman, a stupendous success, and his host\r\nof admirers came in large numbers, everyone simply flocking to hear him\r\nthough ships of any sort, phantom or the reverse, on the stage usually\r\nfell a bit flat as also did trains) there was nothing intrinsically\r\nincompatible about it, he conceded. On the contrary that stab in the\r\nback touch was quite in keeping with those italianos though candidly he\r\nwas none the less free to admit those icecreamers and friers in the fish\r\nway not to mention the chip potato variety and so forth over in little\r\nItaly there near the Coombe were sober thrifty hardworking fellows\r\nexcept perhaps a bit too given to pothunting the harmless necessary\r\nanimal of the feline persuasion of others at night so as to have a good\r\nold succulent tuckin with garlic de rigueur off him or her next day on\r\nthe quiet and, he added, on the cheap.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Spaniards, for instance, he continued, passionate temperaments like\r\nthat, impetuous as Old Nick, are given to taking the law into their own\r\nhands and give you your quietus doublequick with those poignards they\r\ncarry in the abdomen. It comes from the great heat, climate generally.\r\nMy wife is, so to speak, Spanish, half that is. Point of fact she could\r\nactually claim Spanish nationality if she wanted, having been born in\r\n(technically) Spain, i.e. Gibraltar. She has the Spanish type. Quite\r\ndark, regular brunette, black. I for one certainly believe climate\r\naccounts for character. That\xe2\x80\x99s why I asked you if you wrote your poetry\r\nin Italian.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94The temperaments at the door, Stephen interposed with, were very\r\npassionate about ten shillings. Roberto ruba roba sua.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Quite so, Mr Bloom dittoed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Then, Stephen said staring and rambling on to himself or some unknown\r\nlistener somewhere, we have the impetuosity of Dante and the isosceles\r\ntriangle miss Portinari he fell in love with and Leonardo and san\r\nTommaso Mastino.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94It\xe2\x80\x99s in the blood, Mr Bloom acceded at once. All are washed in the\r\nblood of the sun. Coincidence I just happened to be in the Kildare\r\nstreet museum today, shortly prior to our meeting if I can so call it,\r\nand I was just looking at those antique statues there. The splendid\r\nproportions of hips, bosom. You simply don\xe2\x80\x99t knock against those kind of\r\nwomen here. An exception here and there. Handsome yes, pretty in a way\r\nyou find but what I\xe2\x80\x99m talking about is the female form. Besides they\r\nhave so little taste in dress, most of them, which greatly enhances a\r\nwoman\xe2\x80\x99s natural beauty, no matter what you say. Rumpled stockings, it\r\nmay be, possibly is, a foible of mine but still it\xe2\x80\x99s a thing I simply\r\nhate to see.\r\n\r\nInterest, however, was starting to flag somewhat all round and then the\r\nothers got on to talking about accidents at sea, ships lost in a fog,\r\ncollisions with icebergs, all that sort of thing. Shipahoy of course\r\nhad his own say to say. He had doubled the cape a few odd times and\r\nweathered a monsoon, a kind of wind, in the China seas and through all\r\nthose perils of the deep there was one thing, he declared, stood to him\r\nor words to that effect, a pious medal he had that saved him.\r\n\r\nSo then after that they drifted on to the wreck off Daunt\xe2\x80\x99s rock, wreck\r\nof that illfated Norwegian barque nobody could think of her name for\r\nthe moment till the jarvey who had really quite a look of Henry Campbell\r\nremembered it Palme on Booterstown strand. That was the talk of the town\r\nthat year (Albert William Quill wrote a fine piece of original verse of\r\ndistinctive merit on the topic for the Irish Times), breakers running\r\nover her and crowds and crowds on the shore in commotion petrified with\r\nhorror. Then someone said something about the case of the s. s. Lady\r\nCairns of Swansea run into by the Mona which was on an opposite tack\r\nin rather muggyish weather and lost with all hands on deck. No aid was\r\ngiven. Her master, the Mona\xe2\x80\x99s, said he was afraid his collision bulkhead\r\nwould give way. She had no water, it appears, in her hold.\r\n\r\nAt this stage an incident happened. It having become necessary for him\r\nto unfurl a reef the sailor vacated his seat.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Let me cross your bows mate, he said to his neighbour who was just\r\ngently dropping off into a peaceful doze.\r\n\r\nHe made tracks heavily, slowly with a dumpy sort of a gait to the door,\r\nstepped heavily down the one step there was out of the shelter and bore\r\ndue left. While he was in the act of getting his bearings Mr Bloom who\r\nnoticed when he stood up that he had two flasks of presumably ship\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nrum sticking one out of each pocket for the private consumption of his\r\nburning interior, saw him produce a bottle and uncork it or unscrew and,\r\napplying its nozzle to his lips, take a good old delectable swig out of\r\nit with a gurgling noise. The irrepressible Bloom, who also had a\r\nshrewd suspicion that the old stager went out on a man\xc5\x93uvre after the\r\ncounterattraction in the shape of a female who however had disappeared\r\nto all intents and purposes, could by straining just perceive him, when\r\nduly refreshed by his rum puncheon exploit, gaping up at the piers and\r\ngirders of the Loop line rather out of his depth as of course it was all\r\nradically altered since his last visit and greatly improved. Some person\r\nor persons invisible directed him to the male urinal erected by the\r\ncleansing committee all over the place for the purpose but after a brief\r\nspace of time during which silence reigned supreme the sailor, evidently\r\ngiving it a wide berth, eased himself closer at hand, the noise of his\r\nbilgewater some little time subsequently splashing on the ground where\r\nit apparently awoke a horse of the cabrank. A hoof scooped anyway for\r\nnew foothold after sleep and harness jingled. Slightly disturbed in his\r\nsentrybox by the brazier of live coke the watcher of the corporation\r\nstones who, though now broken down and fast breaking up, was none other\r\nin stern reality than the Gumley aforesaid, now practically on the\r\nparish rates, given the temporary job by Pat Tobin in all human\r\nprobability from dictates of humanity knowing him before shifted about\r\nand shuffled in his box before composing his limbs again in to the arms\r\nof Morpheus, a truly amazing piece of hard lines in its most virulent\r\nform on a fellow most respectably connected and familiarised with decent\r\nhome comforts all his life who came in for a cool \xc2\xa3 100 a year at one\r\ntime which of course the doublebarrelled ass proceeded to make general\r\nducks and drakes of. And there he was at the end of his tether after\r\nhaving often painted the town tolerably pink without a beggarly stiver.\r\nHe drank needless to be told and it pointed only once more a moral\r\nwhen he might quite easily be in a large way of business if\xe2\x80\x94a big if,\r\nhowever\xe2\x80\x94he had contrived to cure himself of his particular partiality.\r\n\r\nAll meantime were loudly lamenting the falling off in Irish shipping,\r\ncoastwise and foreign as well, which was all part and parcel of the same\r\nthing. A Palgrave Murphy boat was put off the ways at Alexandra basin,\r\nthe only launch that year. Right enough the harbours were there only no\r\nships ever called.\r\n\r\nThere were wrecks and wreckers, the keeper said, who was evidently au\r\nfait.\r\n\r\nWhat he wanted to ascertain was why that ship ran bang against the only\r\nrock in Galway bay when the Galway harbour scheme was mooted by a Mr\r\nWorthington or some name like that, eh? Ask the then captain, he advised\r\nthem, how much palmoil the British government gave him for that day\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwork, Captain John Lever of the Lever Line.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Am I right, skipper? he queried of the sailor, now returning after his\r\nprivate potation and the rest of his exertions.\r\n\r\nThat worthy picking up the scent of the fagend of the song or words\r\ngrowled in wouldbe music but with great vim some kind of chanty or other\r\nin seconds or thirds. Mr Bloom\xe2\x80\x99s sharp ears heard him then expectorate\r\nthe plug probably (which it was), so that he must have lodged it for the\r\ntime being in his fist while he did the drinking and making water jobs\r\nand found it a bit sour after the liquid fire in question. Anyhow in\r\nhe rolled after his successful libation-cum-potation, introducing an\r\natmosphere of drink into the soir\xc3\xa9e, boisterously trolling, like a\r\nveritable son of a seacook:\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x94The biscuits was as hard as brass\r\n     And the beef as salt as Lot\xe2\x80\x99s wife\xe2\x80\x99s arse.\r\n     O, Johnny Lever!\r\n     Johnny Lever, O!\r\n\r\nAfter which effusion the redoubtable specimen duly arrived on the scene\r\nand regaining his seat he sank rather than sat heavily on the form\r\nprovided. Skin-the-Goat, assuming he was he, evidently with an axe to\r\ngrind, was airing his grievances in a forcible-feeble philippic anent\r\nthe natural resources of Ireland or something of that sort which he\r\ndescribed in his lengthy dissertation as the richest country bar none on\r\nthe face of God\xe2\x80\x99s earth, far and away superior to England, with coal in\r\nlarge quantities, six million pounds worth of pork exported every year,\r\nten millions between butter and eggs and all the riches drained out of\r\nit by England levying taxes on the poor people that paid through the\r\nnose always and gobbling up the best meat in the market and a lot more\r\nsurplus steam in the same vein. Their conversation accordingly became\r\ngeneral and all agreed that that was a fact. You could grow any mortal\r\nthing in Irish soil, he stated, and there was that colonel Everard down\r\nthere in Navan growing tobacco. Where would you find anywhere the like\r\nof Irish bacon? But a day of reckoning, he stated crescendo with no\r\nuncertain voice, thoroughly monopolising all the conversation, was in\r\nstore for mighty England, despite her power of pelf on account of her\r\ncrimes. There would be a fall and the greatest fall in history.\r\nThe Germans and the Japs were going to have their little lookin, he\r\naffirmed. The Boers were the beginning of the end. Brummagem England was\r\ntoppling already and her downfall would be Ireland, her Achilles heel,\r\nwhich he explained to them about the vulnerable point of Achilles, the\r\nGreek hero, a point his auditors at once seized as he completely gripped\r\ntheir attention by showing the tendon referred to on his boot. His\r\nadvice to every Irishman was: stay in the land of your birth and work\r\nfor Ireland and live for Ireland. Ireland, Parnell said, could not spare\r\na single one of her sons.\r\n\r\nSilence all round marked the termination of his finale. The impervious\r\nnavigator heard these lurid tidings, undismayed.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Take a bit of doing, boss, retaliated that rough diamond palpably a bit\r\npeeved in response to the foregoing truism.\r\n\r\nTo which cold douche referring to downfall and so on the keeper\r\nconcurred but nevertheless held to his main view.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Who\xe2\x80\x99s the best troops in the army? the grizzled old veteran irately\r\ninterrogated. And the best jumpers and racers? And the best admirals and\r\ngenerals we\xe2\x80\x99ve got? Tell me that.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94The Irish, for choice, retorted the cabby like Campbell, facial\r\nblemishes apart.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94That\xe2\x80\x99s right, the old tarpaulin corroborated. The Irish catholic\r\npeasant. He\xe2\x80\x99s the backbone of our empire. You know Jem Mullins?\r\n\r\nWhile allowing him his individual opinions as everyman the keeper added\r\nhe cared nothing for any empire, ours or his, and considered no Irishman\r\nworthy of his salt that served it. Then they began to have a few\r\nirascible words when it waxed hotter, both, needless to say, appealing\r\nto the listeners who followed the passage of arms with interest so long\r\nas they didn\xe2\x80\x99t indulge in recriminations and come to blows.\r\n\r\nFrom inside information extending over a series of years Mr Bloom was\r\nrather inclined to poohpooh the suggestion as egregious balderdash for,\r\npending that consummation devoutly to be or not to be wished for, he was\r\nfully cognisant of the fact that their neighbours across the channel,\r\nunless they were much bigger fools than he took them for, rather\r\nconcealed their strength than the opposite. It was quite on a par with\r\nthe quixotic idea in certain quarters that in a hundred million years\r\nthe coal seam of the sister island would be played out and if, as\r\ntime went on, that turned out to be how the cat jumped all he could\r\npersonally say on the matter was that as a host of contingencies,\r\nequally relevant to the issue, might occur ere then it was highly\r\nadvisable in the interim to try to make the most of both countries even\r\nthough poles apart. Another little interesting point, the amours of\r\nwhores and chummies, to put it in common parlance, reminded him Irish\r\nsoldiers had as often fought for England as against her, more so, in\r\nfact. And now, why? So the scene between the pair of them, the licensee\r\nof the place rumoured to be or have been Fitzharris, the famous\r\ninvincible, and the other, obviously bogus, reminded him forcibly as\r\nbeing on all fours with the confidence trick, supposing, that is, it was\r\nprearranged as the lookeron, a student of the human soul if anything,\r\nthe others seeing least of the game. And as for the lessee or keeper,\r\nwho probably wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the other person at all, he (B.) couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help\r\nfeeling and most properly it was better to give people like that the\r\ngoby unless you were a blithering idiot altogether and refuse to have\r\nanything to do with them as a golden rule in private life and their\r\nfelonsetting, there always being the offchance of a Dannyman coming\r\nforward and turning queen\xe2\x80\x99s evidence or king\xe2\x80\x99s now like Denis or Peter\r\nCarey, an idea he utterly repudiated. Quite apart from that he disliked\r\nthose careers of wrongdoing and crime on principle. Yet, though such\r\ncriminal propensities had never been an inmate of his bosom in any\r\nshape or form, he certainly did feel and no denying it (while inwardly\r\nremaining what he was) a certain kind of admiration for a man who\r\nhad actually brandished a knife, cold steel, with the courage of his\r\npolitical convictions (though, personally, he would never be a party to\r\nany such thing), off the same bat as those love vendettas of the south,\r\nhave her or swing for her, when the husband frequently, after some words\r\npassed between the two concerning her relations with the other lucky\r\nmortal (he having had the pair watched), inflicted fatal injuries on his\r\nadored one as a result of an alternative postnuptial liaison by plunging\r\nhis knife into her, until it just struck him that Fitz, nicknamed\r\nSkin-the-Goat, merely drove the car for the actual perpetrators of the\r\noutrage and so was not, if he was reliably informed, actually party to\r\nthe ambush which, in point of fact, was the plea some legal luminary\r\nsaved his skin on. In any case that was very ancient history by now and\r\nas for our friend, the pseudo Skin-the-etcetera, he had transparently\r\noutlived his welcome. He ought to have either died naturally or on\r\nthe scaffold high. Like actresses, always farewell positively last\r\nperformance then come up smiling again. Generous to a fault of course,\r\ntemperamental, no economising or any idea of the sort, always snapping\r\nat the bone for the shadow. So similarly he had a very shrewd suspicion\r\nthat Mr Johnny Lever got rid of some \xc2\xa3. s. d. in the course of his\r\nperambulations round the docks in the congenial atmosphere of the Old\r\nIreland tavern, come back to Erin and so on. Then as for the other he\r\nhad heard not so long before the same identical lingo as he told Stephen\r\nhow he simply but effectually silenced the offender.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94He took umbrage at something or other, that muchinjured but on the\r\nwhole eventempered person declared, I let slip. He called me a jew and\r\nin a heated fashion offensively. So I without deviating from plain facts\r\nin the least told him his God, I mean Christ, was a jew too and all his\r\nfamily like me though in reality I\xe2\x80\x99m not. That was one for him. A soft\r\nanswer turns away wrath. He hadn\xe2\x80\x99t a word to say for himself as everyone\r\nsaw. Am I not right?\r\n\r\nHe turned a long you are wrong gaze on Stephen of timorous dark pride\r\nat the soft impeachment with a glance also of entreaty for he seemed to\r\nglean in a kind of a way that it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t all exactly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Ex quibus, Stephen mumbled in a noncommittal accent, their two or four\r\neyes conversing, Christus or Bloom his name is or after all any other,\r\nsecundum carnem.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Of course, Mr B. proceeded to stipulate, you must look at both sides of\r\nthe question. It is hard to lay down any hard and fast rules as to right\r\nand wrong but room for improvement all round there certainly is\r\nthough every country, they say, our own distressful included, has the\r\ngovernment it deserves. But with a little goodwill all round. It\xe2\x80\x99s all\r\nvery fine to boast of mutual superiority but what about mutual equality.\r\nI resent violence and intolerance in any shape or form. It never\r\nreaches anything or stops anything. A revolution must come on the due\r\ninstalments plan. It\xe2\x80\x99s a patent absurdity on the face of it to hate\r\npeople because they live round the corner and speak another vernacular,\r\nin the next house so to speak.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Memorable bloody bridge battle and seven minutes\xe2\x80\x99 war, Stephen\r\nassented, between Skinner\xe2\x80\x99s alley and Ormond market.\r\n\r\nYes, Mr Bloom thoroughly agreed, entirely endorsing the remark, that\r\nwas overwhelmingly right. And the whole world was full of that sort of\r\nthing.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94You just took the words out of my mouth, he said. A hocuspocus of\r\nconflicting evidence that candidly you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t remotely...\r\n\r\nAll those wretched quarrels, in his humble opinion, stirring up\r\nbad blood, from some bump of combativeness or gland of some kind,\r\nerroneously supposed to be about a punctilio of honour and a flag, were\r\nvery largely a question of the money question which was at the back of\r\neverything, greed and jealousy, people never knowing when to stop.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94They accuse, remarked he audibly. He turned away from the others, who probably\xe2\x80\xa6 and spoke nearer to, so as the others\xe2\x80\xa6 in case they\xe2\x80\xa6\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Jews, he softly imparted in an aside in Stephen\xe2\x80\x99s ear, are accused of\r\nruining. Not a vestige of truth in it, I can safely say. History, would\r\nyou be surprised to learn, proves up to the hilt Spain decayed when the\r\ninquisition hounded the jews out and England prospered when Cromwell,\r\nan uncommonly able ruffian who in other respects has much to answer for,\r\nimported them. Why? Because they are imbued with the proper spirit. They\r\nare practical and are proved to be so. I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to indulge in any\r\nbecause you know the standard works on the subject and then orthodox as\r\nyou are. But in the economic, not touching religion, domain the priest\r\nspells poverty. Spain again, you saw in the war, compared with goahead\r\nAmerica. Turks. It\xe2\x80\x99s in the dogma. Because if they didn\xe2\x80\x99t believe they\xe2\x80\x99d\r\ngo straight to heaven when they die they\xe2\x80\x99d try to live better, at least\r\nso I think. That\xe2\x80\x99s the juggle on which the p.p.\xe2\x80\x98s raise the wind\r\non false pretences. I\xe2\x80\x99m, he resumed with dramatic force, as good an\r\nIrishman as that rude person I told you about at the outset and I want\r\nto see everyone, concluded he, all creeds and classes pro rata having a\r\ncomfortable tidysized income, in no niggard fashion either, something\r\nin the neighbourhood of \xc2\xa3 300 per annum. That\xe2\x80\x99s the vital issue at stake\r\nand it\xe2\x80\x99s feasible and would be provocative of friendlier intercourse\r\nbetween man and man. At least that\xe2\x80\x99s my idea for what it\xe2\x80\x99s worth. I\r\ncall that patriotism. Ubi patria, as we learned a smattering of in our\r\nclassical days in Alma Mater, vita bene. Where you can live well, the\r\nsense is, if you work.\r\n\r\nOver his untastable apology for a cup of coffee, listening to this\r\nsynopsis of things in general, Stephen stared at nothing in particular.\r\nHe could hear, of course, all kinds of words changing colour like those\r\ncrabs about Ringsend in the morning burrowing quickly into all colours\r\nof different sorts of the same sand where they had a home somewhere\r\nbeneath or seemed to. Then he looked up and saw the eyes that said or\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t say the words the voice he heard said, if you work.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Count me out, he managed to remark, meaning work.\r\n\r\nThe eyes were surprised at this observation because as he, the person\r\nwho owned them pro tem. observed or rather his voice speaking did, all\r\nmust work, have to, together.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I mean, of course, the other hastened to affirm, work in the widest\r\npossible sense. Also literary labour not merely for the kudos of\r\nthe thing. Writing for the newspapers which is the readiest channel\r\nnowadays. That\xe2\x80\x99s work too. Important work. After all, from the little\r\nI know of you, after all the money expended on your education you are\r\nentitled to recoup yourself and command your price. You have every bit\r\nas much right to live by your pen in pursuit of your philosophy as the\r\npeasant has. What? You both belong to Ireland, the brain and the brawn.\r\nEach is equally important.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94You suspect, Stephen retorted with a sort of a half laugh, that I\r\nmay be important because I belong to the faubourg Saint Patrice called\r\nIreland for short.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I would go a step farther, Mr Bloom insinuated.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94But I suspect, Stephen interrupted, that Ireland must be important\r\nbecause it belongs to me.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94What belongs, queried Mr Bloom bending, fancying he was perhaps under\r\nsome misapprehension. Excuse me. Unfortunately, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t catch the\r\nlatter portion. What was it you...?\r\n\r\nStephen, patently crosstempered, repeated and shoved aside his mug of\r\ncoffee or whatever you like to call it none too politely, adding:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94We can\xe2\x80\x99t change the country. Let us change the subject.\r\n\r\nAt this pertinent suggestion Mr Bloom, to change the subject, looked\r\ndown but in a quandary, as he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t tell exactly what construction\r\nto put on belongs to which sounded rather a far cry. The rebuke of some\r\nkind was clearer than the other part. Needless to say the fumes of\r\nhis recent orgy spoke then with some asperity in a curious bitter way\r\nforeign to his sober state. Probably the homelife to which Mr B attached\r\nthe utmost importance had not been all that was needful or he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nbeen familiarised with the right sort of people. With a touch of fear\r\nfor the young man beside him whom he furtively scrutinised with an air\r\nof some consternation remembering he had just come back from Paris,\r\nthe eyes more especially reminding him forcibly of father and sister,\r\nfailing to throw much light on the subject, however, he brought to mind\r\ninstances of cultured fellows that promised so brilliantly nipped in the\r\nbud of premature decay and nobody to blame but themselves. For instance\r\nthere was the case of O\xe2\x80\x99Callaghan, for one, the halfcrazy faddist,\r\nrespectably connected though of inadequate means, with his mad vagaries\r\namong whose other gay doings when rotto and making himself a nuisance\r\nto everybody all round he was in the habit of ostentatiously sporting\r\nin public a suit of brown paper (a fact). And then the usual d\xc3\xa9nouement\r\nafter the fun had gone on fast and furious he got landed into hot water\r\nand had to be spirited away by a few friends, after a strong hint to a\r\nblind horse from John Mallon of Lower Castle Yard, so as not to be made\r\namenable under section two of the criminal law amendment act, certain\r\nnames of those subp\xc5\x93naed being handed in but not divulged for reasons\r\nwhich will occur to anyone with a pick of brains. Briefly, putting two\r\nand two together, six sixteen which he pointedly turned a deaf ear to,\r\nAntonio and so forth, jockeys and esthetes and the tattoo which was\r\nall the go in the seventies or thereabouts even in the house of lords\r\nbecause early in life the occupant of the throne, then heir apparent,\r\nthe other members of the upper ten and other high personages simply\r\nfollowing in the footsteps of the head of the state, he reflected about\r\nthe errors of notorieties and crowned heads running counter to morality\r\nsuch as the Cornwall case a number of years before under their veneer in\r\na way scarcely intended by nature, a thing good Mrs Grundy, as the law\r\nstands, was terribly down on though not for the reason they thought\r\nthey were probably whatever it was except women chiefly who were always\r\nfiddling more or less at one another it being largely a matter of\r\ndress and all the rest of it. Ladies who like distinctive underclothing\r\nshould, and every welltailored man must, trying to make the gap wider\r\nbetween them by innuendo and give more of a genuine filip to acts of\r\nimpropriety between the two, she unbuttoned his and then he untied her,\r\nmind the pin, whereas savages in the cannibal islands, say, at ninety\r\ndegrees in the shade not caring a continental. However, reverting to the\r\noriginal, there were on the other hand others who had forced their way\r\nto the top from the lowest rung by the aid of their bootstraps. Sheer\r\nforce of natural genius, that. With brains, sir.\r\n\r\nFor which and further reasons he felt it was his interest and duty even\r\nto wait on and profit by the unlookedfor occasion though why he could\r\nnot exactly tell being as it was already several shillings to the\r\nbad having in fact let himself in for it. Still to cultivate the\r\nacquaintance of someone of no uncommon calibre who could provide food\r\nfor reflection would amply repay any small. Intellectual stimulation,\r\nas such, was, he felt, from time to time a firstrate tonic for the mind.\r\nAdded to which was the coincidence of meeting, discussion, dance, row,\r\nold salt of the here today and gone tomorrow type, night loafers, the\r\nwhole galaxy of events, all went to make up a miniature cameo of the\r\nworld we live in especially as the lives of the submerged tenth, viz.\r\ncoalminers, divers, scavengers etc., were very much under the microscope\r\nlately. To improve the shining hour he wondered whether he might meet\r\nwith anything approaching the same luck as Mr Philip Beaufoy if taken\r\ndown in writing suppose he were to pen something out of the common\r\ngroove (as he fully intended doing) at the rate of one guinea per\r\ncolumn. My Experiences, let us say, in a Cabman\xe2\x80\x99s Shelter.\r\n\r\nThe pink edition extra sporting of the Telegraph tell a graphic lie\r\nlay, as luck would have it, beside his elbow and as he was just puzzling\r\nagain, far from satisfied, over a country belonging to him and the\r\npreceding rebus the vessel came from Bridgwater and the postcard was\r\naddressed A. Boudin find the captain\xe2\x80\x99s age, his eyes went aimlessly\r\nover the respective captions which came under his special province the\r\nallembracing give us this day our daily press.

P. which, he\r\nreflected, was anything but a gay sendoff. Or a change of address\r\nanyway.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94This morning (Hynes put it in of course) the remains of the late Mr\r\nPatrick Dignam were removed from his residence, no 9 Newbridge Avenue,\r\nSandymount, for interment in Glasnevin. The deceased gentleman was a\r\nmost popular and genial personality in city life and his demise after a\r\nbrief illness came as a great shock to citizens of all classes by whom\r\nhe is deeply regretted. The obsequies, at which many friends of the\r\ndeceased were present, were carried out (certainly Hynes wrote it with\r\na nudge from Corny) by Messrs H. J. O\xe2\x80\x99Neill and Son, 164 North Strand\r\nRoad. The mourners included: Patk. Dignam (son), Bernard Corrigan\r\n(brother-in-law), Jno.

Lord Howard de Walden\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nZinfandel (M. Cannon) 2. Mr W. Bass\xe2\x80\x99s Sceptre 3. Betting 5 to 4 on\r\nZinfandel, 20 to 1 Throwaway (off). Sceptre a shade heavier. Throwaway\r\nand Zinfandel stood close. It was anybody\xe2\x80\x99s race then the rank outsider\r\ndrew to the fore, got long lead, beating Lord Howard de Walden\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nchestnut colt and Mr W. Bass\xe2\x80\x99s bay filly Sceptre on a 2 1/2 mile course.\r\nWinner trained by Braime so that Lenehan\xe2\x80\x99s version of the business was\r\nall pure buncombe. Secured the verdict cleverly by a length. 1000 sovs\r\nwith 3000 in specie. Also ran: J de Bremond\xe2\x80\x99s (French horse Bantam Lyons\r\nwas anxiously inquiring after not in yet but expected any minute)\r\nMaximum II. Different ways of bringing off a coup. Lovemaking damages.\r\nThough that halfbaked Lyons ran off at a tangent in his impetuosity to\r\nget left. Of course gambling eminently lent itself to that sort of thing\r\nthough as the event turned out the poor fool hadn\xe2\x80\x99t much reason to\r\ncongratulate himself on his pick, the forlorn hope. Guesswork it reduced\r\nitself to eventually.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94There was every indication they would arrive at that, he, Bloom, said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Who? the other, whose hand by the way was hurt, said.\r\n\r\nOne morning you would open the paper, the cabman affirmed, and read:\r\nReturn of Parnell. He bet them what they liked. A Dublin fusilier was in\r\nthat shelter one night and said he saw him in South Africa. Pride it was\r\nkilled him. He ought to have done away with himself or lain low for a\r\ntime after committee room no 15 until he was his old self again with\r\nno-one to point a finger at him. Then they would all to a man have gone\r\ndown on their marrowbones to him to come back when he had recovered\r\nhis senses. Dead he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t. Simply absconded somewhere. The coffin they\r\nbrought over was full of stones. He changed his name to De Wet, the Boer\r\ngeneral. He made a mistake to fight the priests. And so forth and so on.\r\n\r\nAll the same Bloom (properly so dubbed) was rather surprised at their\r\nmemories for in nine cases out of ten it was a case of tarbarrels and\r\nnot singly but in their thousands and then complete oblivion because it\r\nwas twenty odd years. Highly unlikely of course there was even a shadow\r\nof truth in the stones and, even supposing, he thought a return highly\r\ninadvisable, all things considered. Something evidently riled them in\r\nhis death. Either he petered out too tamely of acute pneumonia just when\r\nhis various different political arrangements were nearing completion\r\nor whether it transpired he owed his death to his having neglected to\r\nchange his boots and clothes after a wetting when a cold resulted and\r\nfailing to consult a specialist he being confined to his room till he\r\neventually died of it amid widespread regret before a fortnight was at\r\nan end or quite possibly they were distressed to find the job was taken\r\nout of their hands. Of course nobody being acquainted with his movements\r\neven before there was absolutely no clue as to his whereabouts which\r\nwere decidedly of the Alice, where art thou order even prior to his\r\nstarting to go under several aliases such as Fox and Stewart so the\r\nremark which emanated from friend cabby might be within the bounds of\r\npossibility. Naturally then it would prey on his mind as a born leader\r\nof men which undoubtedly he was and a commanding figure, a sixfooter\r\nor at any rate five feet ten or eleven in his stockinged feet, whereas\r\nMessrs So and So who, though they weren\xe2\x80\x99t even a patch on the former\r\nman, ruled the roost after their redeeming features were very few and\r\nfar between. It certainly pointed a moral, the idol with feet of clay,\r\nand then seventytwo of his trusty henchmen rounding on him with mutual\r\nmudslinging. And the identical same with murderers. You had to come\r\nback. That haunting sense kind of drew you. To show the understudy in\r\nthe title r\xc3\xb4le how to. He saw him once on the auspicious occasion when\r\nthey broke up the type in the Insuppressible or was it United Ireland,\r\na privilege he keenly appreciated, and, in point of fact, handed him his\r\nsilk hat when it was knocked off and he said Thank you, excited as he\r\nundoubtedly was under his frigid exterior notwithstanding the little\r\nmisadventure mentioned between the cup and the lip: what\xe2\x80\x99s bred in the\r\nbone. Still as regards return. You were a lucky dog if they didn\xe2\x80\x99t set\r\nthe terrier at you directly you got back. Then a lot of shillyshally\r\nusually followed, Tom for and Dick and Harry against. And then, number\r\none, you came up against the man in possession and had to produce your\r\ncredentials like the claimant in the Tichborne case, Roger Charles\r\nTichborne, Bella was the boat\xe2\x80\x99s name to the best of his recollection\r\nhe, the heir, went down in as the evidence went to show and there was\r\na tattoo mark too in Indian ink, lord Bellew was it, as he might very\r\neasily have picked up the details from some pal on board ship and then,\r\nwhen got up to tally with the description given, introduce himself with:\r\nExcuse me, my name is So and So or some such commonplace remark. A more\r\nprudent course, as Bloom said to the not over effusive, in fact like the\r\ndistinguished personage under discussion beside him, would have been to\r\nsound the lie of the land first.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94That bitch, that English whore, did for him, the shebeen proprietor\r\ncommented. She put the first nail in his coffin.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Fine lump of a woman all the same, the soi-disant townclerk Henry\r\nCampbell remarked, and plenty of her. She loosened many a man\xe2\x80\x99s thighs.\r\nI seen her picture in a barber\xe2\x80\x99s. The husband was a captain or an\r\nofficer.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Ay, Skin-the-Goat amusingly added, he was and a cottonball one.\r\n\r\nThis gratuitous contribution of a humorous character occasioned a fair\r\namount of laughter among his entourage. As regards Bloom he, without the\r\nfaintest suspicion of a smile, merely gazed in the direction of the door\r\nand reflected upon the historic story which had aroused extraordinary\r\ninterest at the time when the facts, to make matters worse, were made\r\npublic with the usual affectionate letters that passed between them full\r\nof sweet nothings. First it was strictly Platonic till nature intervened\r\nand an attachment sprang up between them till bit by bit matters came to\r\na climax and the matter became the talk of the town till the staggering\r\nblow came as a welcome intelligence to not a few evildisposed, however,\r\nwho were resolved upon encompassing his downfall though the thing was\r\npublic property all along though not to anything like the sensational\r\nextent that it subsequently blossomed into. Since their names were\r\ncoupled, though, since he was her declared favourite, where was the\r\nparticular necessity to proclaim it to the rank and file from the\r\nhousetops, the fact, namely, that he had shared her bedroom which came\r\nout in the witnessbox on oath when a thrill went through the packed\r\ncourt literally electrifying everybody in the shape of witnesses\r\nswearing to having witnessed him on such and such a particular date in\r\nthe act of scrambling out of an upstairs apartment with the assistance\r\nof a ladder in night apparel, having gained admittance in the same\r\nfashion, a fact the weeklies, addicted to the lubric a little, simply\r\ncoined shoals of money out of. Whereas the simple fact of the case was\r\nit was simply a case of the husband not being up to the scratch, with\r\nnothing in common between them beyond the name, and then a real man\r\narriving on the scene, strong to the verge of weakness, falling a victim\r\nto her siren charms and forgetting home ties, the usual sequel, to bask\r\nin the loved one\xe2\x80\x99s smiles. The eternal question of the life connubial,\r\nneedless to say, cropped up. Can real love, supposing there happens to\r\nbe another chap in the case, exist between married folk? Poser.\r\nThough it was no concern of theirs absolutely if he regarded her with\r\naffection, carried away by a wave of folly. A magnificent specimen of\r\nmanhood he was truly augmented obviously by gifts of a high order, as\r\ncompared with the other military supernumerary that is (who was just the\r\nusual everyday farewell, my gallant captain kind of an individual in\r\nthe light dragoons, the 18th hussars to be accurate) and inflammable\r\ndoubtless (the fallen leader, that is, not the other) in his own\r\npeculiar way which she of course, woman, quickly perceived as highly\r\nlikely to carve his way to fame which he almost bid fair to do till the\r\npriests and ministers of the gospel as a whole, his erstwhile staunch\r\nadherents, and his beloved evicted tenants for whom he had done yeoman\r\nservice in the rural parts of the country by taking up the cudgels on\r\ntheir behalf in a way that exceeded their most sanguine expectations,\r\nvery effectually cooked his matrimonial goose, thereby heaping coals of\r\nfire on his head much in the same way as the fabled ass\xe2\x80\x99s kick. Looking\r\nback now in a retrospective kind of arrangement all seemed a kind of\r\ndream. And then coming back was the worst thing you ever did because it\r\nwent without saying you would feel out of place as things always moved\r\nwith the times. Why, as he reflected, Irishtown strand, a locality he\r\nhad not been in for quite a number of years looked different somehow\r\nsince, as it happened, he went to reside on the north side. North or\r\nsouth, however, it was just the wellknown case of hot passion, pure and\r\nsimple, upsetting the applecart with a vengeance and just bore out the\r\nvery thing he was saying as she also was Spanish or half so, types that\r\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do things by halves, passionate abandon of the south, casting\r\nevery shred of decency to the winds.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Just bears out what I was saying, he, with glowing bosom said to\r\nStephen, about blood and the sun. And, if I don\xe2\x80\x99t greatly mistake she\r\nwas Spanish too.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94The king of Spain\xe2\x80\x99s daughter, Stephen answered, adding something or\r\nother rather muddled about farewell and adieu to you Spanish onions and\r\nthe first land called the Deadman and from Ramhead to Scilly was so and\r\nso many.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Was she? Bloom ejaculated, surprised though not astonished by any\r\nmeans, I never heard that rumour before. Possible, especially there, it\r\nwas as she lived there. So, Spain.\r\n\r\nCarefully avoiding a book in his pocket Sweets of, which reminded him\r\nby the by of that Capel street library book out of date, he took out his\r\npocketbook and, turning over the various contents it contained rapidly\r\nfinally he.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Do you consider, by the by, he said, thoughtfully selecting a faded\r\nphoto which he laid on the table, that a Spanish type?\r\n\r\nStephen, obviously addressed, looked down on the photo showing a large\r\nsized lady with her fleshy charms on evidence in an open fashion as she\r\nwas in the full bloom of womanhood in evening dress cut ostentatiously\r\nlow for the occasion to give a liberal display of bosom, with more than\r\nvision of breasts, her full lips parted and some perfect teeth, standing\r\nnear, ostensibly with gravity, a piano on the rest of which was In Old\r\nMadrid, a ballad, pretty in its way, which was then all the vogue. Her\r\n(the lady\xe2\x80\x99s) eyes, dark, large, looked at Stephen, about to smile about\r\nsomething to be admired, Lafayette of Westmoreland street, Dublin\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npremier photographic artist, being responsible for the esthetic\r\nexecution.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Mrs Bloom, my wife the prima donna Madam Marion Tweedy, Bloom\r\nindicated. Taken a few years since. In or about ninety six. Very like\r\nher then.\r\n\r\nBeside the young man he looked also at the photo of the lady now his\r\nlegal wife who, he intimated, was the accomplished daughter of Major\r\nBrian Tweedy and displayed at an early age remarkable proficiency as a\r\nsinger having even made her bow to the public when her years numbered\r\nbarely sweet sixteen. As for the face it was a speaking likeness in\r\nexpression but it did not do justice to her figure which came in for a\r\nlot of notice usually and which did not come out to the best advantage\r\nin that getup. She could without difficulty, he said, have posed for the\r\nensemble, not to dwell on certain opulent curves of the. He dwelt, being\r\na bit of an artist in his spare time, on the female form in general\r\ndevelopmentally because, as it so happened, no later than that afternoon\r\nhe had seen those Grecian statues, perfectly developed as works of art,\r\nin the National Museum. Marble could give the original, shoulders, back,\r\nall the symmetry, all the rest. Yes, puritanisme, it does though, Saint\r\nJoseph\xe2\x80\x99s sovereign thievery alors (Bandez!) Figne toi trop. Whereas no\r\nphoto could because it simply wasn\xe2\x80\x99t art in a word.\r\n\r\nThe spirit moving him he would much have liked to follow Jack Tar\xe2\x80\x99s good\r\nexample and leave the likeness there for a very few minutes to speak for\r\nitself on the plea he so that the other could drink in the beauty for\r\nhimself, her stage presence being, frankly, a treat in itself which the\r\ncamera could not at all do justice to. But it was scarcely professional\r\netiquette so. Though it was a warm pleasant sort of a night now yet\r\nwonderfully cool for the season considering, for sunshine after storm.\r\nAnd he did feel a kind of need there and then to follow suit like a\r\nkind of inward voice and satisfy a possible need by moving a motion.\r\nNevertheless he sat tight just viewing the slightly soiled photo creased\r\nby opulent curves, none the worse for wear however, and looked away\r\nthoughtfully with the intention of not further increasing the other\xe2\x80\x99s\r\npossible embarrassment while gauging her symmetry of heaving embonpoint.\r\nIn fact the slight soiling was only an added charm like the case of\r\nlinen slightly soiled, good as new, much better in fact with the starch\r\nout. Suppose she was gone when he? I looked for the lamp which she told\r\nme came into his mind but merely as a passing fancy of his because he\r\nthen recollected the morning littered bed etcetera and the book about\r\nRuby with met him pike hoses (sic) in it which must have fell down\r\nsufficiently appropriately beside the domestic chamberpot with apologies\r\nto Lindley Murray.\r\n\r\nThe vicinity of the young man he certainly relished, educated, distingu\xc3\xa9\r\nand impulsive into the bargain, far and away the pick of the bunch\r\nthough you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t think he had it in him yet you would. Besides he\r\nsaid the picture was handsome which, say what you like, it was though\r\nat the moment she was distinctly stouter. And why not? An awful lot of\r\nmakebelieve went on about that sort of thing involving a lifelong slur\r\nwith the usual splash page of gutterpress about the same old matrimonial\r\ntangle alleging misconduct with professional golfer or the newest\r\nstage favourite instead of being honest and aboveboard about the whole\r\nbusiness. How they were fated to meet and an attachment sprang up\r\nbetween the two so that their names were coupled in the public eye\r\nwas told in court with letters containing the habitual mushy and\r\ncompromising expressions leaving no loophole to show that they openly\r\ncohabited two or three times a week at some wellknown seaside hotel and\r\nrelations, when the thing ran its normal course, became in due course\r\nintimate. Then the decree nisi and the King\xe2\x80\x99s proctor tries to show\r\ncause why and, he failing to quash it, nisi was made absolute. But as\r\nfor that the two misdemeanants, wrapped up as they largely were in one\r\nanother, could safely afford to ignore it as they very largely did till\r\nthe matter was put in the hands of a solicitor who filed a petition for\r\nthe party wronged in due course. He, B, enjoyed the distinction of being\r\nclose to Erin\xe2\x80\x99s uncrowned king in the flesh when the thing occurred on\r\nthe historic fracas when the fallen leader\xe2\x80\x99s, who notoriously stuck to\r\nhis guns to the last drop even when clothed in the mantle of adultery,\r\n(leader\xe2\x80\x99s) trusty henchmen to the number of ten or a dozen or\r\npossibly even more than that penetrated into the printing works of the\r\nInsuppressible or no it was United Ireland (a by no means by the by\r\nappropriate appellative) and broke up the typecases with hammers or\r\nsomething like that all on account of some scurrilous effusions from\r\nthe facile pens of the O\xe2\x80\x99Brienite scribes at the usual mudslinging\r\noccupation reflecting on the erstwhile tribune\xe2\x80\x99s private morals. Though\r\npalpably a radically altered man he was still a commanding figure though\r\ncarelessly garbed as usual with that look of settled purpose which went\r\na long way with the shillyshallyers till they discovered to their vast\r\ndiscomfiture that their idol had feet of clay after placing him upon a\r\npedestal which she, however, was the first to perceive. As those were\r\nparticularly hot times in the general hullaballoo Bloom sustained a\r\nminor injury from a nasty prod of some chap\xe2\x80\x99s elbow in the crowd that\r\nof course congregated lodging some place about the pit of the stomach,\r\nfortunately not of a grave character. His hat (Parnell\xe2\x80\x99s) a silk one was\r\ninadvertently knocked off and, as a matter of strict history, Bloom was\r\nthe man who picked it up in the crush after witnessing the occurrence\r\nmeaning to return it to him (and return it to him he did with the utmost\r\ncelerity) who panting and hatless and whose thoughts were miles away\r\nfrom his hat at the time all the same being a gentleman born with a\r\nstake in the country he, as a matter of fact, having gone into it more\r\nfor the kudos of the thing than anything else, what\xe2\x80\x99s bred in the bone\r\ninstilled into him in infancy at his mother\xe2\x80\x99s knee in the shape of\r\nknowing what good form was came out at once because he turned round to\r\nthe donor and thanked him with perfect aplomb, saying: Thank you, sir,\r\nthough in a very different tone of voice from the ornament of the legal\r\nprofession whose headgear Bloom also set to rights earlier in the course\r\nof the day, history repeating itself with a difference, after the burial\r\nof a mutual friend when they had left him alone in his glory after the\r\ngrim task of having committed his remains to the grave.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand what incensed him more inwardly was the blatant\r\njokes of the cabman and so on who passed it all off as a jest, laughing\r\nimmoderately, pretending to understand everything, the why and the\r\nwherefore, and in reality not knowing their own minds, it being a case\r\nfor the two parties themselves unless it ensued that the legitimate\r\nhusband happened to be a party to it owing to some anonymous letter from\r\nthe usual boy Jones, who happened to come across them at the crucial\r\nmoment in a loving position locked in one another\xe2\x80\x99s arms, drawing\r\nattention to their illicit proceedings and leading up to a domestic\r\nrumpus and the erring fair one begging forgiveness of her lord and\r\nmaster upon her knees and promising to sever the connection and not\r\nreceive his visits any more if only the aggrieved husband would overlook\r\nthe matter and let bygones be bygones with tears in her eyes though\r\npossibly with her tongue in her fair cheek at the same time as quite\r\npossibly there were several others. He personally, being of a sceptical\r\nbias, believed and didn\xe2\x80\x99t make the smallest bones about saying so either\r\nthat man or men in the plural were always hanging around on the waiting\r\nlist about a lady, even supposing she was the best wife in the world\r\nand they got on fairly well together for the sake of argument, when,\r\nneglecting her duties, she chose to be tired of wedded life and was on\r\nfor a little flutter in polite debauchery to press their attentions on\r\nher with improper intent, the upshot being that her affections centred\r\non another, the cause of many liaisons between still attractive married\r\nwomen getting on for fair and forty and younger men, no doubt as several\r\nfamous cases of feminine infatuation proved up to the hilt.\r\n\r\nIt was a thousand pities a young fellow, blessed with an allowance of\r\nbrains as his neighbour obviously was, should waste his valuable time\r\nwith profligate women who might present him with a nice dose to last him\r\nhis lifetime. In the nature of single blessedness he would one day take\r\nunto himself a wife when Miss Right came on the scene but in the interim\r\nladies\xe2\x80\x99 society was a conditio sine qua non though he had the gravest\r\npossible doubts, not that he wanted in the smallest to pump Stephen\r\nabout Miss Ferguson (who was very possibly the particular lodestar who\r\nbrought him down to Irishtown so early in the morning), as to whether he\r\nwould find much satisfaction basking in the boy and girl courtship idea\r\nand the company of smirking misses without a penny to their names bi or\r\ntriweekly with the orthodox preliminary canter of complimentplaying and\r\nwalking out leading up to fond lovers\xe2\x80\x99 ways and flowers and chocs. To\r\nthink of him house and homeless, rooked by some landlady worse than any\r\nstepmother, was really too bad at his age. The queer suddenly things\r\nhe popped out with attracted the elder man who was several years the\r\nother\xe2\x80\x99s senior or like his father but something substantial he certainly\r\nought to eat even were it only an eggflip made on unadulterated maternal\r\nnutriment or, failing that, the homely Humpty Dumpty boiled.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94At what o\xe2\x80\x99clock did you dine? he questioned of the slim form and tired\r\nthough unwrinkled face.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Some time yesterday, Stephen said.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Yesterday! exclaimed Bloom till he remembered it was already tomorrow\r\nFriday. Ah, you mean it\xe2\x80\x99s after twelve!\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94The day before yesterday, Stephen said, improving on himself.\r\n\r\nLiterally astounded at this piece of intelligence Bloom reflected.\r\nThough they didn\xe2\x80\x99t see eye to eye in everything a certain analogy there\r\nsomehow was as if both their minds were travelling, so to speak, in the\r\none train of thought. At his age when dabbling in politics roughly\r\nsome score of years previously when he had been a quasi aspirant to\r\nparliamentary honours in the Buckshot Foster days he too recollected in\r\nretrospect (which was a source of keen satisfaction in itself) he had\r\na sneaking regard for those same ultra ideas. For instance when the\r\nevicted tenants question, then at its first inception, bulked largely in\r\npeople\xe2\x80\x99s mind though, it goes without saying, not contributing a copper\r\nor pinning his faith absolutely to its dictums, some of which wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\nexactly hold water, he at the outset in principle at all events was in\r\nthorough sympathy with peasant possession as voicing the trend of modern\r\nopinion (a partiality, however, which, realising his mistake, he was\r\nsubsequently partially cured of) and even was twitted with going a\r\nstep farther than Michael Davitt in the striking views he at one time\r\ninculcated as a backtothelander, which was one reason he strongly\r\nresented the innuendo put upon him in so barefaced a fashion by our\r\nfriend at the gathering of the clans in Barney Kiernan\xe2\x80\x99s so that he,\r\nthough often considerably misunderstood and the least pugnacious of\r\nmortals, be it repeated, departed from his customary habit to give\r\nhim (metaphorically) one in the gizzard though, so far as politics\r\nthemselves were concerned, he was only too conscious of the casualties\r\ninvariably resulting from propaganda and displays of mutual animosity\r\nand the misery and suffering it entailed as a foregone conclusion on\r\nfine young fellows, chiefly, destruction of the fittest, in a word.\r\n\r\nAnyhow upon weighing up the pros and cons, getting on for one, as it\r\nwas, it was high time to be retiring for the night. The crux was it\r\nwas a bit risky to bring him home as eventualities might possibly ensue\r\n(somebody having a temper of her own sometimes) and spoil the hash\r\naltogether as on the night he misguidedly brought home a dog (breed\r\nunknown) with a lame paw (not that the cases were either identical or\r\nthe reverse though he had hurt his hand too) to Ontario Terrace as he\r\nvery distinctly remembered, having been there, so to speak. On the\r\nother hand it was altogether far and away too late for the Sandymount\r\nor Sandycove suggestion so that he was in some perplexity as to which of\r\nthe two alternatives. Everything pointed to the fact that it behoved him\r\nto avail himself to the full of the opportunity, all things considered.\r\nHis initial impression was he was a shade standoffish or not over\r\neffusive but it grew on him someway. For one thing he mightn\xe2\x80\x99t what you\r\ncall jump at the idea, if approached, and what mostly worried him was\r\nhe didn\xe2\x80\x99t know how to lead up to it or word it exactly, supposing he\r\ndid entertain the proposal, as it would afford him very great personal\r\npleasure if he would allow him to help to put coin in his way or some\r\nwardrobe, if found suitable. At all events he wound up by concluding,\r\neschewing for the nonce hidebound precedent, a cup of Epps\xe2\x80\x99s cocoa and\r\na shakedown for the night plus the use of a rug or two and overcoat\r\ndoubled into a pillow at least he would be in safe hands and as warm as\r\na toast on a trivet he failed to perceive any very vast amount of harm\r\nin that always with the proviso no rumpus of any sort was kicked up.\r\nA move had to be made because that merry old soul, the grasswidower\r\nin question who appeared to be glued to the spot, didn\xe2\x80\x99t appear in any\r\nparticular hurry to wend his way home to his dearly beloved Queenstown\r\nand it was highly likely some sponger\xe2\x80\x99s bawdyhouse of retired beauties\r\nwhere age was no bar off Sheriff street lower would be the best clue\r\nto that equivocal character\xe2\x80\x99s whereabouts for a few days to come,\r\nalternately racking their feelings (the mermaids\xe2\x80\x99) with sixchamber\r\nrevolver anecdotes verging on the tropical calculated to freeze\r\nthe marrow of anybody\xe2\x80\x99s bones and mauling their largesized charms\r\nbetweenwhiles with rough and tumble gusto to the accompaniment of large\r\npotations of potheen and the usual blarney about himself for as to who\r\nhe in reality was let x equal my right name and address, as Mr Algebra\r\nremarks passim. At the same time he inwardly chuckled over his gentle\r\nrepartee to the blood and ouns champion about his god being a jew.\r\nPeople could put up with being bitten by a wolf but what properly riled\r\nthem was a bite from a sheep. The most vulnerable point too of tender\r\nAchilles. Your god was a jew. Because mostly they appeared to imagine he\r\ncame from Carrick-on-Shannon or somewhereabouts in the county Sligo.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94I propose, our hero eventually suggested after mature reflection while\r\nprudently pocketing her photo, as it\xe2\x80\x99s rather stuffy here you just come\r\nhome with me and talk things over. My diggings are quite close in the\r\nvicinity. You can\xe2\x80\x99t drink that stuff. Do you like cocoa? Wait. I\xe2\x80\x99ll just\r\npay this lot.\r\n\r\nThe best plan clearly being to clear out, the remainder being plain\r\nsailing, he beckoned, while prudently pocketing the photo, to the keeper\r\nof the shanty who didn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Yes, that\xe2\x80\x99s the best, he assured Stephen to whom for the matter of that\r\nBrazen Head or him or anywhere else was all more or less.\r\n\r\nAll kinds of Utopian plans were flashing through his (B\xe2\x80\x99s) busy brain,\r\neducation (the genuine article), literature, journalism, prize titbits,\r\nup to date billing, concert tours in English watering resorts packed\r\nwith hydros and seaside theatres, turning money away, duets in Italian\r\nwith the accent perfectly true to nature and a quantity of other\r\nthings, no necessity, of course, to tell the world and his wife from the\r\nhousetops about it, and a slice of luck. An opening was all was wanted.\r\nBecause he more than suspected he had his father\xe2\x80\x99s voice to bank his\r\nhopes on which it was quite on the cards he had so it would be just as\r\nwell, by the way no harm, to trail the conversation in the direction of\r\nthat particular red herring just to.\r\n\r\nThe cabby read out of the paper he had got hold of that the former\r\nviceroy, earl Cadogan, had presided at the cabdrivers\xe2\x80\x99 association\r\ndinner in London somewhere. Silence with a yawn or two accompanied this\r\nthrilling announcement. Then the old specimen in the corner who appeared\r\nto have some spark of vitality left read out that sir Anthony MacDonnell\r\nhad left Euston for the chief secretary\xe2\x80\x99s lodge or words to that effect.\r\nTo which absorbing piece of intelligence echo answered why.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Give us a squint at that literature, grandfather, the ancient mariner\r\nput in, manifesting some natural impatience.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94And welcome, answered the elderly party thus addressed.\r\n\r\nThe sailor lugged out from a case he had a pair of greenish goggles\r\nwhich he very slowly hooked over his nose and both ears.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Are you bad in the eyes? the sympathetic personage like the townclerk\r\nqueried.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Why, answered the seafarer with the tartan beard, who seemingly was\r\na bit of a literary cove in his own small way, staring out of seagreen\r\nportholes as you might well describe them as, I uses goggles reading.\r\nSand in the Red Sea done that. One time I could read a book in the dark,\r\nmanner of speaking. The Arabian Nights Entertainment was my favourite\r\nand Red as a Rose is She.\r\n\r\nHereupon he pawed the journal open and pored upon Lord only knows what,\r\nfound drowned or the exploits of King Willow, Iremonger having made a\r\nhundred and something second wicket not out for Notts, during which\r\ntime (completely regardless of Ire) the keeper was intensely occupied\r\nloosening an apparently new or secondhand boot which manifestly pinched\r\nhim as he muttered against whoever it was sold it, all of them who were\r\nsufficiently awake enough to be picked out by their facial expressions,\r\nthat is to say, either simply looking on glumly or passing a trivial\r\nremark.\r\n\r\nTo cut a long story short Bloom, grasping the situation, was the first\r\nto rise from his seat so as not to outstay their welcome having first\r\nand foremost, being as good as his word that he would foot the bill for\r\nthe occasion, taken the wise precaution to unobtrusively motion to mine\r\nhost as a parting shot a scarcely perceptible sign when the others were\r\nnot looking to the effect that the amount due was forthcoming, making a\r\ngrand total of fourpence (the amount he deposited unobtrusively in\r\nfour coppers, literally the last of the Mohicans), he having previously\r\nspotted on the printed pricelist for all who ran to read opposite him\r\nin unmistakable figures, coffee 2d, confectionery do, and honestly well\r\nworth twice the money once in a way, as Wetherup used to remark.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Come, he counselled to close the s\xc3\xa9ance.\r\n\r\nSeeing that the ruse worked and the coast was clear they left the\r\nshelter or shanty together and the \xc3\xa9lite society of oilskin and company\r\nwhom nothing short of an earthquake would move out of their dolce far\r\nniente. Stephen, who confessed to still feeling poorly and fagged out,\r\npaused at the, for a moment, the door.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94One thing I never understood, he said to be original on the spur of the\r\nmoment. Why they put tables upside down at night, I mean chairs upside\r\ndown, on the tables in caf\xc3\xa9s. To which impromptu the neverfailing Bloom\r\nreplied without a moment\xe2\x80\x99s hesitation, saying straight off:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94To sweep the floor in the morning.\r\n\r\nSo saying he skipped around, nimbly considering, frankly at the same\r\ntime apologetic to get on his companion\xe2\x80\x99s right, a habit of his, by the\r\nbye, his right side being, in classical idiom, his tender Achilles. The\r\nnight air was certainly now a treat to breathe though Stephen was a bit\r\nweak on his pins.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94It will (the air) do you good, Bloom said, meaning also the walk, in\r\na moment. The only thing is to walk then you\xe2\x80\x99ll feel a different man.\r\nCome. It\xe2\x80\x99s not far. Lean on me.\r\n\r\nAccordingly he passed his left arm in Stephen\xe2\x80\x99s right and led him on\r\naccordingly.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Yes, Stephen said uncertainly because he thought he felt a strange kind\r\nof flesh of a different man approach him, sinewless and wobbly and all\r\nthat.\r\n\r\nAnyhow they passed the sentrybox with stones, brazier etc. where\r\nthe municipal supernumerary, ex Gumley, was still to all intents and\r\npurposes wrapped in the arms of Murphy, as the adage has it, dreaming\r\nof fresh fields and pastures new. And apropos of coffin of stones the\r\nanalogy was not at all bad as it was in fact a stoning to death on the\r\npart of seventytwo out of eighty odd constituencies that ratted at the\r\ntime of the split and chiefly the belauded peasant class, probably the\r\nselfsame evicted tenants he had put in their holdings.\r\n\r\nSo they turned on to chatting about music, a form of art for which\r\nBloom, as a pure amateur, possessed the greatest love, as they made\r\ntracks arm in arm across Beresford place. Wagnerian music, though\r\nconfessedly grand in its way, was a bit too heavy for Bloom and hard\r\nto follow at the first go-off but the music of Mercadante\xe2\x80\x99s Huguenots,\r\nMeyerbeer\xe2\x80\x99s Seven Last Words on the Cross and Mozart\xe2\x80\x99s Twelfth Mass he\r\nsimply revelled in, the Gloria in that being, to his mind, the acme of\r\nfirst class music as such, literally knocking everything else into a\r\ncocked hat. He infinitely preferred the sacred music of the catholic\r\nchurch to anything the opposite shop could offer in that line such\r\nas those Moody and Sankey hymns or Bid me to live and I will live thy\r\nprotestant to be. He also yielded to none in his admiration of Rossini\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nStabat Mater, a work simply abounding in immortal numbers, in which his\r\nwife, Madam Marion Tweedy, made a hit, a veritable sensation, he might\r\nsafely say, greatly adding to her other laurels and putting the others\r\ntotally in the shade, in the jesuit fathers\xe2\x80\x99 church in upper Gardiner\r\nstreet, the sacred edifice being thronged to the doors to hear her with\r\nvirtuosos, or virtuosi rather. There was the unanimous opinion that\r\nthere was none to come up to her and suffice it to say in a place of\r\nworship for music of a sacred character there was a generally voiced\r\ndesire for an encore. On the whole though favouring preferably light\r\nopera of the Don Giovanni description and Martha, a gem in its line,\r\nhe had a penchant, though with only a surface knowledge, for the severe\r\nclassical school such as Mendelssohn. And talking of that, taking it\r\nfor granted he knew all about the old favourites, he mentioned par\r\nexcellence Lionel\xe2\x80\x99s air in Martha, M\xe2\x80\x99appari, which, curiously enough, he\r\nhad heard or overheard, to be more accurate, on yesterday, a privilege\r\nhe keenly appreciated, from the lips of Stephen\xe2\x80\x99s respected father, sung\r\nto perfection, a study of the number, in fact, which made all the others\r\ntake a back seat. Stephen, in reply to a politely put query, said he\r\ndidn\xe2\x80\x99t sing it but launched out into praises of Shakespeare\xe2\x80\x99s songs,\r\nat least of in or about that period, the lutenist Dowland who lived\r\nin Fetter lane near Gerard the herbalist, who anno ludendo hausi,\r\nDoulandus, an instrument he was contemplating purchasing from Mr Arnold\r\nDolmetsch, whom B. did not quite recall though the name certainly\r\nsounded familiar, for sixtyfive guineas and Farnaby and son with their\r\ndux and comes conceits and Byrd (William) who played the virginals,\r\nhe said, in the Queen\xe2\x80\x99s chapel or anywhere else he found them and one\r\nTomkins who made toys or airs and John Bull.\r\n\r\nOn the roadway which they were approaching whilst still speaking beyond\r\nthe swingchains a horse, dragging a sweeper, paced on the paven ground,\r\nbrushing a long swathe of mire up so that with the noise Bloom was not\r\nperfectly certain whether he had caught aright the allusion to sixtyfive\r\nguineas and John Bull. He inquired if it was John Bull the political\r\ncelebrity of that ilk, as it struck him, the two identical names, as a\r\nstriking coincidence.\r\n\r\nBy the chains the horse slowly swerved to turn, which perceiving, Bloom,\r\nwho was keeping a sharp lookout as usual, plucked the other\xe2\x80\x99s sleeve\r\ngently, jocosely remarking:\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94Our lives are in peril tonight. Beware of the steamroller.\r\n\r\nThey thereupon stopped. Bloom looked at the head of a horse not worth\r\nanything like sixtyfive guineas, suddenly in evidence in the dark quite\r\nnear so that it seemed new, a different grouping of bones and even flesh\r\nbecause palpably it was a fourwalker, a hipshaker, a blackbuttocker, a\r\ntaildangler, a headhanger putting his hind foot foremost the while the\r\nlord of his creation sat on the perch, busy with his thoughts. But such\r\na good poor brute he was sorry he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t a lump of sugar but, as he\r\nwisely reflected, you could scarcely be prepared for every emergency\r\nthat might crop up. He was just a big nervous foolish noodly kind of a\r\nhorse, without a second care in the world. But even a dog, he reflected,\r\ntake that mongrel in Barney Kiernan\xe2\x80\x99s, of the same size, would be a holy\r\nhorror to face. But it was no animal\xe2\x80\x99s fault in particular if he was\r\nbuilt that way like the camel, ship of the desert, distilling grapes\r\ninto potheen in his hump. Nine tenths of them all could be caged or\r\ntrained, nothing beyond the art of man barring the bees. Whale with a\r\nharpoon hairpin, alligator tickle the small of his back and he sees the\r\njoke, chalk a circle for a rooster, tiger my eagle eye. These timely\r\nreflections anent the brutes of the field occupied his mind somewhat\r\ndistracted from Stephen\xe2\x80\x99s words while the ship of the street was\r\nman\xc5\x93uvring and Stephen went on about the highly interesting old.\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\x94What\xe2\x80\x99s this I was saying? Ah, yes! My wife, he intimated, plunging\r\nin medias res, would have the greatest of pleasure in making your\r\nacquaintance as she is passionately attached to music of any kind.\r\n\r\nHe looked sideways in a friendly fashion at the sideface of Stephen,\r\nimage of his mother, which was not quite the same as the usual handsome\r\nblackguard type they unquestionably had an insatiable hankering after as\r\nhe was perhaps not that way built.\r\n\r\nStill, supposing he had his father\xe2\x80\x99s gift as he more than suspected,\r\nit opened up new vistas in his mind such as Lady Fingall\xe2\x80\x99s Irish\r\nindustries, concert on the preceding Monday, and aristocracy in general.\r\n\r\nExquisite variations he was now describing on an air Youth here has End\r\nby Jans Pieter Sweelinck, a Dutchman of Amsterdam where the frows come\r\nfrom. Even more he liked an old German song of Johannes Jeep about\r\nthe clear sea and the voices of sirens, sweet murderers of men, which\r\nboggled Bloom a bit:\r\n\r\n     Von der Sirenen Listigkeit\r\n     Tun die Poeten dichten.\r\n\r\nThese opening bars he sang and translated extempore. Bloom, nodding,\r\nsaid he perfectly understood and begged him to go on by all means which\r\nhe did.\r\n\r\nA phenomenally beautiful tenor voice like that, the rarest of boons,\r\nwhich Bloom appreciated at the very first note he got out, could easily,\r\nif properly handled by some recognised authority on voice production\r\nsuch as Barraclough and being able to read music into the bargain,\r\ncommand its own price where baritones were ten a penny and procure for\r\nits fortunate possessor in the near future an entr\xc3\xa9e into fashionable\r\nhouses in the best residential quarters of financial magnates in a large\r\nway of business and titled people where with his university degree of\r\nB. A. (a huge ad in its way) and gentlemanly bearing to all the more\r\ninfluence the good impression he would infallibly score a distinct\r\nsuccess, being blessed with brains which also could be utilised for the\r\npurpose and other requisites, if his clothes were properly attended\r\nto so as to the better worm his way into their good graces as he, a\r\nyouthful tyro in society\xe2\x80\x99s sartorial niceties, hardly understood how a\r\nlittle thing like that could militate against you. It was in fact only a\r\nmatter of months and he could easily foresee him participating in\r\ntheir musical and artistic conversaziones during the festivities of the\r\nChristmas season, for choice, causing a slight flutter in the dovecotes\r\nof the fair sex and being made a lot of by ladies out for sensation,\r\ncases of which, as he happened to know, were on record\xe2\x80\x94in fact, without\r\ngiving the show away, he himself once upon a time, if he cared to, could\r\neasily have. Added to which of course would be the pecuniary emolument\r\nby no means to be sneezed at, going hand in hand with his tuition\r\nfees. Not, he parenthesised, that for the sake of filthy lucre he need\r\nnecessarily embrace the lyric platform as a walk in life for any lengthy\r\nspace of time. But a step in the required direction it was beyond yea or\r\nnay and both monetarily and mentally it contained no reflection on his\r\ndignity in the smallest and it often turned in uncommonly handy to\r\nbe handed a cheque at a muchneeded moment when every little helped.\r\nBesides, though taste latterly had deteriorated to a degree, original\r\nmusic like that, different from the conventional rut, would rapidly\r\nhave a great vogue as it would be a decided novelty for Dublin\xe2\x80\x99s musical\r\nworld after the usual hackneyed run of catchy tenor solos foisted on a\r\nconfiding public by Ivan St Austell and Hilton St Just and their genus\r\nomne. Yes, beyond a shadow of a doubt he could with all the cards in his\r\nhand and he had a capital opening to make a name for himself and win a\r\nhigh place in the city\xe2\x80\x99s esteem where he could command a stiff figure\r\nand, booking ahead, give a grand concert for the patrons of the King\r\nstreet house, given a backerup, if one were forthcoming to kick him\r\nupstairs, so to speak, a big if, however, with some impetus of the\r\ngoahead sort to obviate the inevitable procrastination which often\r\ntripped up a too much f\xc3\xaated prince of good fellows. And it need not\r\ndetract from the other by one iota as, being his own master, he would\r\nhave heaps of time to practise literature in his spare moments when\r\ndesirous of so doing without its clashing with his vocal career or\r\ncontaining anything derogatory whatsoever as it was a matter for himself\r\nalone. In fact, he had the ball at his feet and that was the very reason\r\nwhy the other, possessed of a remarkably sharp nose for smelling a rat\r\nof any sort, hung on to him at all.\r\n\r\nThe horse was just then. And later on at a propitious opportunity he\r\npurposed (Bloom did), without anyway prying into his private affairs\r\non the fools step in where angels principle, advising him to sever his\r\nconnection with a certain budding practitioner who, he noticed, was\r\nprone to disparage and even to a slight extent with some hilarious\r\npretext when not present, deprecate him, or whatever you like to call it\r\nwhich in Bloom\xe2\x80\x99s humble opinion threw a nasty sidelight on that side of\r\na person\xe2\x80\x99s character, no pun intended.\r\n\r\nThe horse having reached the end of his tether, so to speak, halted and,\r\nrearing high a proud feathering tail, added his quota by letting fall on\r\nthe floor which the brush would soon brush up and polish, three smoking\r\nglobes of turds. Slowly three times, one after another, from a full\r\ncrupper he mired. And humanely his driver waited till he (or she) had\r\nended, patient in his scythed car.\r\n\r\nSide by side Bloom, profiting by the contretemps, with Stephen passed\r\nthrough the gap of the chains, divided by the upright, and, stepping\r\nover a strand of mire, went across towards Gardiner street lower,\r\nStephen singing more boldly, but not loudly, the end of the ballad.\r\n\r\n      Und alle Schiffe br\xc3\xbccken.\r\n\r\nThe driver never said a word, good, bad or indifferent, but merely\r\nwatched the two figures, as he sat on his lowbacked car, both black, one\r\nfull, one lean, walk towards the railway bridge, to be married by Father\r\nMaher. As they walked they at times stopped and walked again continuing\r\ntheir t\xc3\xaate \xc3\xa0 t\xc3\xaate (which, of course, he was utterly out of) about\r\nsirens, enemies of man\xe2\x80\x99s reason, mingled with a number of other topics\r\nof the same category, usurpers, historical cases of the kind while the\r\nman in the sweeper car or you might as well call it in the sleeper car\r\nwho in any case couldn\xe2\x80\x99t possibly hear because they were too far simply\r\nsat in his seat near the end of lower Gardiner street and looked after\r\ntheir lowbacked car.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[ 17 ]\r\n\r\nWhat parallel courses did Bloom and Stephen follow returning?\r\n\r\nStarting united both at normal walking pace from Beresford place they\r\nfollowed in the order named Lower and Middle Gardiner streets and\r\nMountjoy square, west: then, at reduced pace, each bearing left,\r\nGardiner\xe2\x80\x99s place by an inadvertence as far as the farther corner of\r\nTemple street: then, at reduced pace with interruptions of halt, bearing\r\nright, Temple street, north, as far as Hardwicke place. Approaching,\r\ndisparate, at relaxed walking pace they crossed both the circus before\r\nGeorge\xe2\x80\x99s church diametrically, the chord in any circle being less than\r\nthe arc which it subtends.\r\n\r\nOf what did the duumvirate deliberate during their itinerary?\r\n\r\nMusic, literature, Ireland, Dublin, Paris, friendship, woman,\r\nprostitution, diet, the influence of gaslight or the light of arc and\r\nglowlamps on the growth of adjoining paraheliotropic trees, exposed\r\ncorporation emergency dustbuckets, the Roman catholic church,\r\necclesiastical celibacy, the Irish nation, jesuit education, careers,\r\nthe study of medicine, the past day, the maleficent influence of the\r\npresabbath, Stephen\xe2\x80\x99s collapse.\r\n\r\nDid Bloom discover common factors of similarity between their respective\r\nlike and unlike reactions to experience?\r\n\r\nBoth were sensitive to artistic impressions, musical in preference to\r\nplastic or pictorial. Both preferred a continental to an insular manner\r\nof life, a cisatlantic to a transatlantic place of residence. Both\r\nindurated by early domestic training and an inherited tenacity of\r\nheterodox resistance professed their disbelief in many orthodox\r\nreligious, national, social and ethical doctrines. Both admitted\r\nthe alternately stimulating and obtunding influence of heterosexual\r\nmagnetism.\r\n\r\nWere their views on some points divergent?\r\n\r\nStephen dissented openly from Bloom\xe2\x80\x99s views on the importance of dietary\r\nand civic selfhelp while Bloom dissented tacitly from Stephen\xe2\x80\x99s views\r\non the eternal affirmation of the spirit of man in literature. Bloom\r\nassented covertly to Stephen\xe2\x80\x99s rectification of the anachronism\r\ninvolved in assigning the date of the conversion of the Irish nation to\r\nchristianity from druidism by Patrick son of Calpornus, son of Potitus,\r\nson of Odyssus, sent by pope Celestine I in the year 432 in the reign\r\nof Leary to the year 260 or thereabouts in the reign of Cormac MacArt (\xe2\x80\xa0\r\n266 A.D.), suffocated by imperfect deglutition of aliment at Sletty\r\nand interred at Rossnaree. The collapse which Bloom ascribed to\r\ngastric inanition and certain chemical compounds of varying degrees of\r\nadulteration and alcoholic strength, accelerated by mental exertion and\r\nthe velocity of rapid circular motion in a relaxing atmosphere, Stephen\r\nattributed to the reapparition of a matutinal cloud (perceived by both\r\nfrom two different points of observation Sandycove and Dublin) at first\r\nno bigger than a woman\xe2\x80\x99s hand.\r\n\r\nWas there one point on which their views were equal and negative?\r\n\r\nThe influence of gaslight or electric light on the growth of adjoining\r\nparaheliotropic trees.\r\n\r\nHad Bloom discussed similar subjects during nocturnal perambulations in\r\nthe past?\r\n\r\nIn 1884 with Owen Goldberg and Cecil Turnbull at night on public\r\nthoroughfares between Longwood avenue and Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s corner and Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ncorner and Synge street and Synge street and Bloomfield avenue. In 1885\r\nwith Percy Apjohn in the evenings, reclined against the wall between\r\nGibraltar villa and Bloomfield house in Crumlin, barony of Uppercross.\r\nIn 1886 occasionally with casual acquaintances and prospective\r\npurchasers on doorsteps, in front parlours, in third class railway\r\ncarriages of suburban lines. In 1888 frequently with major Brian Tweedy\r\nand his daughter Miss Marion Tweedy, together and separately on the\r\nlounge in Matthew Dillon\xe2\x80\x99s house in Roundtown. Once in 1892 and once in\r\n1893 with Julius (Juda) Mastiansky, on both occasions in the parlour of\r\nhis (Bloom\xe2\x80\x99s) house in Lombard street, west.\r\n\r\nWhat reflection concerning the irregular sequence of dates 1884, 1885,\r\n1886, 1888, 1892, 1893, 1904 did Bloom make before their arrival at\r\ntheir destination?\r\n\r\nHe reflected that the progressive extension of the field of individual\r\ndevelopment and experience was regressively accompanied by a restriction\r\nof the converse domain of interindividual relations.\r\n\r\nAs in what ways?\r\n\r\nFrom inexistence to existence he came to many and was as one received:\r\nexistence with existence he was with any as any with any: from existence\r\nto nonexistence gone he would be by all as none perceived.\r\n\r\nWhat act did Bloom make on their arrival at their destination?\r\n\r\nAt the housesteps of the 4th of the equidifferent uneven numbers, number\r\n7 Eccles street, he inserted his hand mechanically into the back pocket\r\nof his trousers to obtain his latchkey.\r\n\r\nWas it there?\r\n\r\nIt was in the corresponding pocket of the trousers which he had worn on\r\nthe day but one preceding.\r\n\r\nWhy was he doubly irritated?\r\n\r\nBecause he had forgotten and because he remembered that he had reminded\r\nhimself twice not to forget.\r\n\r\nWhat were then the alternatives before the, premeditatedly\r\n(respectively) and inadvertently, keyless couple?\r\n\r\nTo enter or not to enter. To knock or not to knock.\r\n\r\nBloom\xe2\x80\x99s decision?\r\n\r\nA stratagem. Resting his feet on the dwarf wall, he climbed over the\r\narea railings, compressed his hat on his head, grasped two points at\r\nthe lower union of rails and stiles, lowered his body gradually by its\r\nlength of five feet nine inches and a half to within two feet ten inches\r\nof the area pavement and allowed his body to move freely in space by\r\nseparating himself from the railings and crouching in preparation for\r\nthe impact of the fall.\r\n\r\nDid he fall?\r\n\r\nBy his body\xe2\x80\x99s known weight of eleven stone and four pounds in\r\navoirdupois measure, as certified by the graduated machine for\r\nperiodical selfweighing in the premises of Francis Froedman,\r\npharmaceutical chemist of 19 Frederick street, north, on the last feast\r\nof the Ascension, to wit, the twelfth day of May of the bissextile year\r\none thousand nine hundred and four of the christian era (jewish era five\r\nthousand six hundred and sixtyfour, mohammadan era one thousand three\r\nhundred and twentytwo), golden number 5, epact 13, solar cycle 9,\r\ndominical letters C B, Roman indiction 2, Julian period 6617, MCMIV.\r\n\r\nDid he rise uninjured by concussion?\r\n\r\nRegaining new stable equilibrium he rose uninjured though concussed by\r\nthe impact, raised the latch of the area door by the exertion of force\r\nat its freely moving flange and by leverage of the first kind applied\r\nat its fulcrum, gained retarded access to the kitchen through the\r\nsubadjacent scullery, ignited a lucifer match by friction, set free\r\ninflammable coal gas by turning on the ventcock, lit a high flame which,\r\nby regulating, he reduced to quiescent candescence and lit finally a\r\nportable candle.\r\n\r\nWhat discrete succession of images did Stephen meanwhile perceive?\r\n\r\nReclined against the area railings he perceived through the transparent\r\nkitchen panes a man regulating a gasflame of 14 CP, a man lighting a\r\ncandle of 1 CP, a man removing in turn each of his two boots, a man\r\nleaving the kitchen holding a candle.\r\n\r\nDid the man reappear elsewhere?\r\n\r\nAfter a lapse of four minutes the glimmer of his candle was discernible\r\nthrough the semitransparent semicircular glass fanlight over the\r\nhalldoor. The halldoor turned gradually on its hinges. In the open space\r\nof the doorway the man reappeared without his hat, with his candle.\r\n\r\nDid Stephen obey his sign?\r\n\r\nYes, entering softly, he helped to close and chain the door and followed\r\nsoftly along the hallway the man\xe2\x80\x99s back and listed feet and lighted\r\ncandle past a lighted crevice of doorway on the left and carefully down\r\na turning staircase of more than five steps into the kitchen of Bloom\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\nWhat did Bloom do?\r\n\r\nHe extinguished the candle by a sharp expiration of breath upon its\r\nflame, drew two spoonseat deal chairs to the hearthstone, one for\r\nStephen with its back to the area window, the other for himself when\r\nnecessary, knelt on one knee, composed in the grate a pyre of crosslaid\r\nresintipped sticks and various coloured papers and irregular polygons\r\nof best Abram coal at twentyone shillings a ton from the yard of Messrs\r\nFlower and M\xe2\x80\x99Donald of 14 D\xe2\x80\x99Olier street, kindled it at three projecting\r\npoints of paper with one ignited lucifer match, thereby releasing\r\nthe potential energy contained in the fuel by allowing its carbon and\r\nhydrogen elements to enter into free union with the oxygen of the air.\r\n\r\nOf what similar apparitions did Stephen think?\r\n\r\nOf others elsewhere in other times who, kneeling on one knee or on two,\r\nhad kindled fires for him, of Brother Michael in the infirmary of the\r\ncollege of the Society of Jesus at Clongowes Wood, Sallins, in the\r\ncounty of Kildare: of his father, Simon Dedalus, in an unfurnished room\r\nof his first residence in Dublin, number thirteen Fitzgibbon street:\r\nof his godmother Miss Kate Morkan in the house of her dying sister Miss\r\nJulia Morkan at 15 Usher\xe2\x80\x99s Island: of his aunt Sara, wife of Richie\r\n(Richard) Goulding, in the kitchen of their lodgings at 62 Clanbrassil\r\nstreet: of his mother Mary, wife of Simon Dedalus, in the kitchen of\r\nnumber twelve North Richmond street on the morning of the feast of\r\nSaint Francis Xavier 1898: of the dean of studies, Father Butt, in the\r\nphysics\xe2\x80\x99 theatre of university College, 16 Stephen\xe2\x80\x99s Green, north: of\r\nhis sister Dilly (Delia) in his father\xe2\x80\x99s house in Cabra.\r\n\r\nWhat did Stephen see on raising his gaze to the height of a yard from\r\nthe fire towards the opposite wall?\r\n\r\nUnder a row of five coiled spring housebells a curvilinear rope,\r\nstretched between two holdfasts athwart across the recess beside the\r\nchimney pier, from which hung four smallsized square handkerchiefs\r\nfolded unattached consecutively in adjacent rectangles and one pair of\r\nladies\xe2\x80\x99 grey hose with Lisle suspender tops and feet in their habitual\r\nposition clamped by three erect wooden pegs two at their outer\r\nextremities and the third at their point of junction.\r\n\r\nWhat did Bloom see on the range?\r\n\r\nOn the right (smaller) hob a blue enamelled saucepan: on the left\r\n(larger) hob a black iron kettle.\r\n\r\nWhat did Bloom do at the range?\r\n\r\nHe removed the saucepan to the left hob, rose and carried the iron\r\nkettle to the sink in order to tap the current by turning the faucet to\r\nlet it flow.\r\n\r\nDid it flow?\r\n\r\nYes. From Roundwood reservoir in county Wicklow of a cubic capacity of\r\n2400 million gallons, percolating through a subterranean aqueduct of\r\nfilter mains of single and double pipeage constructed at an initial\r\nplant cost of \xc2\xa3 5 per linear yard by way of the Dargle, Rathdown, Glen\r\nof the Downs and Callowhill to the 26 acre reservoir at Stillorgan, a\r\ndistance of 22 statute miles, and thence, through a system of relieving\r\ntanks, by a gradient of 250 feet to the city boundary at Eustace bridge,\r\nupper Leeson street, though from prolonged summer drouth and daily\r\nsupply of 12 1/2 million gallons the water had fallen below the sill of\r\nthe overflow weir for which reason the borough surveyor and waterworks\r\nengineer, Mr Spencer Harty, C. E., on the instructions of the waterworks\r\ncommittee had prohibited the use of municipal water for purposes other\r\nthan those of consumption (envisaging the possibility of recourse being\r\nhad to the impotable water of the Grand and Royal canals as in 1893)\r\nparticularly as the South Dublin Guardians, notwithstanding their ration\r\nof 15 gallons per day per pauper supplied through a 6 inch meter, had\r\nbeen convicted of a wastage of 20,000 gallons per night by a reading of\r\ntheir meter on the affirmation of the law agent of the corporation, Mr\r\nIgnatius Rice, solicitor, thereby acting to the detriment of another\r\nsection of the public, selfsupporting taxpayers, solvent, sound.\r\n\r\nWhat in water did Bloom, waterlover, drawer of water, watercarrier,\r\nreturning to the range, admire?\r\n\r\nIts universality: its democratic equality and constancy to its nature\r\nin seeking its own level: its vastness in the ocean of Mercator\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nprojection: its unplumbed profundity in the Sundam trench of the Pacific\r\nexceeding 8000 fathoms: the restlessness of its waves and surface\r\nparticles visiting in turn all points of its seaboard: the independence\r\nof its units: the variability of states of sea: its hydrostatic\r\nquiescence in calm: its hydrokinetic turgidity in neap and spring tides:\r\nits subsidence after devastation: its sterility in the circumpolar\r\nicecaps, arctic and antarctic: its climatic and commercial significance:\r\nits preponderance of 3 to 1 over the dry land of the globe: its\r\nindisputable hegemony extending in square leagues over all the region\r\nbelow the subequatorial tropic of Capricorn: the multisecular stability\r\nof its primeval basin: its luteofulvous bed: its capacity to dissolve\r\nand hold in solution all soluble substances including millions of\r\ntons of the most precious metals: its slow erosions of peninsulas and\r\nislands, its persistent formation of homothetic islands, peninsulas\r\nand downwardtending promontories: its alluvial deposits: its weight and\r\nvolume and density: its imperturbability in lagoons and highland tarns:\r\nits gradation of colours in the torrid and temperate and frigid zones:\r\nits vehicular ramifications in continental lakecontained streams and\r\nconfluent oceanflowing rivers with their tributaries and transoceanic\r\ncurrents, gulfstream, north and south equatorial courses: its violence\r\nin seaquakes, waterspouts, Artesian wells, eruptions, torrents, eddies,\r\nfreshets, spates, groundswells, watersheds, waterpartings, geysers,\r\ncataracts, whirlpools, maelstroms, inundations, deluges, cloudbursts:\r\nits vast circumterrestrial ahorizontal curve: its secrecy in springs and\r\nlatent humidity, revealed by rhabdomantic or hygrometric instruments\r\nand exemplified by the well by the hole in the wall at Ashtown\r\ngate, saturation of air, distillation of dew: the simplicity of its\r\ncomposition, two constituent parts of hydrogen with one constituent part\r\nof oxygen: its healing virtues: its buoyancy in the waters of the Dead\r\nSea: its persevering penetrativeness in runnels, gullies, inadequate\r\ndams, leaks on shipboard: its properties for cleansing, quenching thirst\r\nand fire, nourishing vegetation: its infallibility as paradigm and\r\nparagon: its metamorphoses as vapour, mist, cloud, rain, sleet, snow,\r\nhail: its strength in rigid hydrants: its variety of forms in loughs\r\nand bays and gulfs and bights and guts and lagoons and atolls and\r\narchipelagos and sounds and fjords and minches and tidal estuaries and\r\narms of sea: its solidity in glaciers, icebergs, icefloes: its docility\r\nin working hydraulic millwheels, turbines, dynamos, electric power\r\nstations, bleachworks, tanneries, scutchmills: its utility in canals,\r\nrivers, if navigable, floating and graving docks: its potentiality\r\nderivable from harnessed tides or watercourses falling from level\r\nto level: its submarine fauna and flora (anacoustic, photophobe),\r\nnumerically, if not literally, the inhabitants of the globe: its\r\nubiquity as constituting 90 % of the human body: the noxiousness of its\r\neffluvia in lacustrine marshes, pestilential fens, faded flowerwater,\r\nstagnant pools in the waning moon.\r\n\r\nHaving set the halffilled kettle on the now burning coals, why did he\r\nreturn to the stillflowing tap?\r\n\r\nTo wash his soiled hands with a partially consumed tablet of\r\nBarrington\xe2\x80\x99s lemonflavoured soap, to which paper still adhered, (bought\r\nthirteen hours previously for fourpence and still unpaid for), in fresh\r\ncold neverchanging everchanging water and dry them, face and hands, in a\r\nlong redbordered holland cloth passed over a wooden revolving roller.\r\n\r\nWhat reason did Stephen give for declining Bloom\xe2\x80\x99s offer?\r\n\r\nThat he was hydrophobe, hating partial contact by immersion or total by\r\nsubmersion in cold water, (his last bath having taken place in the month\r\nof October of the preceding year), disliking the aqueous substances of\r\nglass and crystal, distrusting aquacities of thought and language.\r\n\r\nWhat impeded Bloom from giving Stephen counsels of hygiene and\r\nprophylactic to which should be added suggestions concerning a\r\npreliminary wetting of the head and contraction of the muscles with\r\nrapid splashing of the face and neck and thoracic and epigastric region\r\nin case of sea or river bathing, the parts of the human anatomy most\r\nsensitive to cold being the nape, stomach and thenar or sole of foot?\r\n\r\nThe incompatibility of aquacity with the erratic originality of genius.\r\n\r\nWhat additional didactic counsels did he similarly repress?\r\n\r\nDietary: concerning the respective percentage of protein and caloric\r\nenergy in bacon, salt ling and butter, the absence of the former in the\r\nlastnamed and the abundance of the latter in the firstnamed.\r\n\r\nWhich seemed to the host to be the predominant qualities of his guest?\r\n\r\nConfidence in himself, an equal and opposite power of abandonment and\r\nrecuperation.\r\n\r\nWhat concomitant phenomenon took place in the vessel of liquid by the\r\nagency of fire?\r\n\r\nThe phenomenon of ebullition. Fanned by a constant updraught of\r\nventilation between the kitchen and the chimneyflue, ignition was\r\ncommunicated from the faggots of precombustible fuel to polyhedral\r\nmasses of bituminous coal, containing in compressed mineral form the\r\nfoliated fossilised decidua of primeval forests which had in turn\r\nderived their vegetative existence from the sun, primal source of heat\r\n(radiant), transmitted through omnipresent luminiferous diathermanous\r\nether. Heat (convected), a mode of motion developed by such\r\ncombustion, was constantly and increasingly conveyed from the source\r\nof calorification to the liquid contained in the vessel, being radiated\r\nthrough the uneven unpolished dark surface of the metal iron, in part\r\nreflected, in part absorbed, in part transmitted, gradually raising\r\nthe temperature of the water from normal to boiling point, a rise in\r\ntemperature expressible as the result of an expenditure of 72 thermal\r\nunits needed to raise 1 pound of water from 50\xc2\xb0 to 212\xc2\xb0 Fahrenheit.\r\n\r\nWhat announced the accomplishment of this rise in temperature?\r\n\r\nA double falciform ejection of water vapour from under the kettlelid at\r\nboth sides simultaneously.\r\n\r\nFor what personal purpose could Bloom have applied the water so boiled?\r\n\r\nTo shave himself.\r\n\r\nWhat advantages attended shaving by night?\r\n\r\nA softer beard: a softer brush if intentionally allowed to remain from\r\nshave to shave in its agglutinated lather: a softer skin if unexpectedly\r\nencountering female acquaintances in remote places at incustomary hours:\r\nquiet reflections upon the course of the day: a cleaner sensation when\r\nawaking after a fresher sleep since matutinal noises, premonitions and\r\nperturbations, a clattered milkcan, a postman\xe2\x80\x99s double knock, a paper\r\nread, reread while lathering, relathering the same spot, a shock, a\r\nshoot, with thought of aught he sought though fraught with nought might\r\ncause a faster rate of shaving and a nick on which incision plaster with\r\nprecision cut and humected and applied adhered: which was to be done.\r\n\r\nWhy did absence of light disturb him less than presence of noise?\r\n\r\nBecause of the surety of the sense of touch in his firm full masculine\r\nfeminine passive active hand.\r\n\r\nWhat quality did it (his hand) possess but with what counteracting\r\ninfluence?\r\n\r\nThe operative surgical quality but that he was reluctant to shed human\r\nblood even when the end justified the means, preferring, in their\r\nnatural order, heliotherapy, psychophysicotherapeutics, osteopathic\r\nsurgery.\r\n\r\nWhat lay under exposure on the lower, middle and upper shelves of the\r\nkitchen dresser, opened by Bloom?\r\n\r\nOn the lower shelf five vertical breakfast plates, six horizontal\r\nbreakfast saucers on which rested inverted breakfast cups, a\r\nmoustachecup, uninverted, and saucer of Crown Derby, four white\r\ngoldrimmed eggcups, an open shammy purse displaying coins, mostly\r\ncopper, and a phial of aromatic (violet) comfits. On the middle shelf\r\na chipped eggcup containing pepper, a drum of table salt, four\r\nconglomerated black olives in oleaginous paper, an empty pot of\r\nPlumtree\xe2\x80\x99s potted meat, an oval wicker basket bedded with fibre and\r\ncontaining one Jersey pear, a halfempty bottle of William Gilbey and\r\nCo\xe2\x80\x99s white invalid port, half disrobed of its swathe of coralpink tissue\r\npaper, a packet of Epps\xe2\x80\x99s soluble cocoa, five ounces of Anne Lynch\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nchoice tea at 2/- per lb in a crinkled leadpaper bag, a cylindrical\r\ncanister containing the best crystallised lump sugar, two onions, one,\r\nthe larger, Spanish, entire, the other, smaller, Irish, bisected with\r\naugmented surface and more redolent, a jar of Irish Model Dairy\xe2\x80\x99s cream,\r\na jug of brown crockery containing a naggin and a quarter of soured\r\nadulterated milk, converted by heat into water, acidulous serum and\r\nsemisolidified curds, which added to the quantity subtracted for Mr\r\nBloom\xe2\x80\x99s and Mrs Fleming\xe2\x80\x99s breakfasts, made one imperial pint, the total\r\nquantity originally delivered, two cloves, a halfpenny and a small dish\r\ncontaining a slice of fresh ribsteak. On the upper shelf a battery of\r\njamjars (empty) of various sizes and proveniences.\r\n\r\nWhat attracted his attention lying on the apron of the dresser?\r\n\r\nFour polygonal fragments of two lacerated scarlet betting tickets,\r\nnumbered 8 87, 88 6.\r\n\r\nWhat reminiscences temporarily corrugated his brow?\r\n\r\nReminiscences of coincidences, truth stranger than fiction,\r\npreindicative of the result of the Gold Cup flat handicap, the official\r\nand definitive result of which he had read in the Evening Telegraph,\r\nlate pink edition, in the cabman\xe2\x80\x99s shelter, at Butt bridge.\r\n\r\nWhere had previous intimations of the result, effected or projected,\r\nbeen received by him?\r\n\r\nIn Bernard Kiernan\xe2\x80\x99s licensed premises 8, 9 and 10 little Britain\r\nstreet: in David Byrne\xe2\x80\x99s licensed premises, 14 Duke street: in O\xe2\x80\x99Connell\r\nstreet lower, outside Graham Lemon\xe2\x80\x99s when a dark man had placed in\r\nhis hand a throwaway (subsequently thrown away), advertising Elijah,\r\nrestorer of the church in Zion: in Lincoln place outside the premises of\r\nF. W. Sweny and Co (Limited), dispensing chemists, when, when Frederick\r\nM. (Bantam) Lyons had rapidly and successively requested, perused and\r\nrestituted the copy of the current issue of the Freeman\xe2\x80\x99s Journal and\r\nNational Press which he had been about to throw away (subsequently\r\nthrown away), he had proceeded towards the oriental edifice of\r\nthe Turkish and Warm Baths, 11 Leinster street, with the light of\r\ninspiration shining in his countenance and bearing in his arms the\r\nsecret of the race, graven in the language of prediction.\r\n\r\nWhat qualifying considerations allayed his perturbations?\r\n\r\nThe difficulties of interpretation since the significance of any event\r\nfollowed its occurrence as variably as the acoustic report followed the\r\nelectrical discharge and of counterestimating against an actual loss\r\nby failure to interpret the total sum of possible losses proceeding\r\noriginally from a successful interpretation.\r\n\r\nHis mood?\r\n\r\nHe had not risked, he did not expect, he had not been disappointed, he\r\nwas satisfied.\r\n\r\nWhat satisfied him?\r\n\r\nTo have sustained no positive loss. To have brought a positive gain to\r\nothers. Light to the gentiles.\r\n\r\nHow did Bloom prepare a collation for a gentile?\r\n\r\nHe poured into two teacups two level spoonfuls, four in all, of Epps\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nsoluble cocoa and proceeded according to the directions for use printed\r\non the label, to each adding after sufficient time for infusion the\r\nprescribed ingredients for diffusion in the manner and in the quantity\r\nprescribed.\r\n\r\nWhat supererogatory marks of special hospitality did the host show his\r\nguest?\r\n\r\nRelinquishing his symposiarchal right to the moustache cup of imitation\r\nCrown Derby presented to him by his only daughter, Millicent (Milly),\r\nhe substituted a cup identical with that of his guest and served\r\nextraordinarily to his guest and, in reduced measure, to himself the\r\nviscous cream ordinarily reserved for the breakfast of his wife Marion\r\n(Molly).\r\n\r\nWas the guest conscious of and did he acknowledge these marks of\r\nhospitality?\r\n\r\nHis attention was directed to them by his host jocosely, and he accepted\r\nthem seriously as they drank in jocoserious silence Epps\xe2\x80\x99s massproduct,\r\nthe creature cocoa.\r\n\r\nWere there marks of hospitality which he contemplated but suppressed,\r\nreserving them for another and for himself on future occasions to\r\ncomplete the act begun?\r\n\r\nThe reparation of a fissure of the length of 1 1/2 inches in the right\r\nside of his guest\xe2\x80\x99s jacket. A gift to his guest of one of the four\r\nlady\xe2\x80\x99s handkerchiefs, if and when ascertained to be in a presentable\r\ncondition.\r\n\r\nWho drank more quickly?\r\n\r\nBloom, having the advantage of ten seconds at the initiation and taking,\r\nfrom the concave surface of a spoon along the handle of which a steady\r\nflow of heat was conducted, three sips to his opponent\xe2\x80\x99s one, six to\r\ntwo, nine to three.\r\n\r\nWhat cerebration accompanied his frequentative act?\r\n\r\nConcluding by inspection but erroneously that his silent companion was\r\nengaged in mental composition he reflected on the pleasures derived from\r\nliterature of instruction rather than of amusement as he himself had\r\napplied to the works of William Shakespeare more than once for the\r\nsolution of difficult problems in imaginary or real life.\r\n\r\nHad he found their solution?\r\n\r\nIn spite of careful and repeated reading of certain classical passages,\r\naided by a glossary, he had derived imperfect conviction from the text,\r\nthe answers not bearing in all points.\r\n\r\nWhat lines concluded his first piece of original verse written by him,\r\npotential poet, at the age of 11 in 1877 on the occasion of the offering\r\nof three prizes of 10/-, 5/- and 2/6 respectively for competition by the\r\nShamrock, a weekly newspaper?\r\n\r\n     An ambition to squint\r\n     At my verses in print\r\n     Makes me hope that for these you\xe2\x80\x99ll find room.\r\n     If you so condescend?\r\n     Then please place at the end\r\n     The name of yours truly, L. Bloom.\r\n\r\nDid he find four separating forces between his temporary guest and him?\r\n\r\nName, age, race, creed.\r\n\r\nWhat anagrams had he made on his name in youth?\r\n\r\n     Leopold Bloom\r\n     Ellpodbomool\r\n     Molldopeloob\r\n     Bollopedoom\r\n     Old Ollebo, M. P.\r\n\r\nWhat acrostic upon the abbreviation of his first name had he (kinetic\r\npoet) sent to Miss Marion (Molly) Tweedy on the 14 February 1888?\r\n\r\n     Poets oft have sung in rhyme\r\n     Of music sweet their praise divine.\r\n     Let them hymn it nine times nine.\r\n     Dearer far than song or wine.\r\n     You are mine. The world is mine.\r\n\r\nWhat had prevented him from completing a topical song (music by R. G.\r\nJohnston) on the events of the past, or fixtures for the actual, years,\r\nentitled If Brian Boru could but come back and see old Dublin now,\r\ncommissioned by Michael Gunn, lessee of the Gaiety Theatre, 46, 47, 48,\r\n49 South King street, and to be introduced into the sixth scene, the\r\nvalley of diamonds, of the second edition (30 January 1893) of the grand\r\nannual Christmas pantomime Sinbad the Sailor (produced by R. Shelton\r\n26 December 1892, written by Greenleaf Whittier, scenery by George\r\nA. Jackson and Cecil Hicks, costumes by Mrs and Miss Whelan under\r\nthe personal supervision of Mrs Michael Gunn, ballets by Jessie Noir,\r\nharlequinade by Thomas Otto) and sung by Nelly Bouverist, principal\r\ngirl?\r\n\r\nFirstly, oscillation between events of imperial and of local interest,\r\nthe anticipated diamond jubilee of Queen Victoria (born 1820, acceded\r\n1837) and the posticipated opening of the new municipal fish market:\r\nsecondly, apprehension of opposition from extreme circles on the\r\nquestions of the respective visits of Their Royal Highnesses the\r\nduke and duchess of York (real) and of His Majesty King Brian Boru\r\n(imaginary): thirdly, a conflict between professional etiquette and\r\nprofessional emulation concerning the recent erections of the Grand\r\nLyric Hall on Burgh Quay and the Theatre Royal in Hawkins street:\r\nfourthly, distraction resultant from compassion for Nelly Bouverist\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nnon-intellectual, non-political, non-topical expression of countenance\r\nand concupiscence caused by Nelly Bouverist\xe2\x80\x99s revelations of white\r\narticles of non-intellectual, non-political, non-topical underclothing\r\nwhile she (Nelly Bouverist) was in the articles: fifthly, the\r\ndifficulties of the selection of appropriate music and humorous\r\nallusions from Everybody\xe2\x80\x99s Book of Jokes (1000 pages and a laugh in\r\nevery one): sixthly, the rhymes, homophonous and cacophonous, associated\r\nwith the names of the new lord mayor, Daniel Tallon, the new high\r\nsheriff, Thomas Pile and the new solicitorgeneral, Dunbar Plunket\r\nBarton.\r\n\r\nWhat relation existed between their ages?\r\n\r\n16 years before in 1888 when Bloom was of Stephen\xe2\x80\x99s present age Stephen\r\nwas 6. 16 years after in 1920 when Stephen would be of Bloom\xe2\x80\x99s present\r\nage Bloom would be 54. In 1936 when Bloom would be 70 and Stephen 54\r\ntheir ages initially in the ratio of 16 to 0 would be as 17 1/2 to 13\r\n1/2, the proportion increasing and the disparity diminishing according\r\nas arbitrary future years were added, for if the proportion existing in\r\n1883 had continued immutable, conceiving that to be possible, till then\r\n1904 when Stephen was 22 Bloom would be 374 and in 1920 when Stephen\r\nwould be 38, as Bloom then was, Bloom would be 646 while in 1952 when\r\nStephen would have attained the maximum postdiluvian age of 70 Bloom,\r\nbeing 1190 years alive having been born in the year 714, would have\r\nsurpassed by 221 years the maximum antediluvian age, that of Methusalah,\r\n969 years, while, if Stephen would continue to live until he would\r\nattain that age in the year 3072 A.D., Bloom would have been obliged to\r\nhave been alive 83,300 years, having been obliged to have been born in\r\nthe year 81,396 B.C.\r\n\r\nWhat events might nullify these calculations?\r\n\r\nThe cessation of existence of both or either, the inauguration of a\r\nnew era or calendar, the annihilation of the world and consequent\r\nextermination of the human species, inevitable but impredictable.\r\n\r\nHow many previous encounters proved their preexisting acquaintance?\r\n\r\nTwo. The first in the lilacgarden of Matthew Dillon\xe2\x80\x99s house, Medina\r\nVilla, Kimmage road, Roundtown, in 1887, in the company of Stephen\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nmother, Stephen being then of the age of 5 and reluctant to give his\r\nhand in salutation. The second in the coffeeroom of Breslin\xe2\x80\x99s hotel on a\r\nrainy Sunday in the January of 1892, in the company of Stephen\xe2\x80\x99s father\r\nand Stephen\xe2\x80\x99s granduncle, Stephen being then 5 years older.\r\n\r\nDid Bloom accept the invitation to dinner given then by the son and\r\nafterwards seconded by the father?\r\n\r\nVery gratefully, with grateful appreciation, with sincere appreciative\r\ngratitude, in appreciatively grateful sincerity of regret, he declined.\r\n\r\nDid their conversation on the subject of these reminiscences reveal a\r\nthird connecting link between them?\r\n\r\nMrs Riordan (Dante), a widow of independent means, had resided in the\r\nhouse of Stephen\xe2\x80\x99s parents from 1 September 1888 to 29 December 1891 and\r\nhad also resided during the years 1892, 1893 and 1894 in the City Arms\r\nHotel owned by Elizabeth O\xe2\x80\x99Dowd of 54 Prussia street where, during parts\r\nof the years 1893 and 1894, she had been a constant informant of Bloom\r\nwho resided also in the same hotel, being at that time a clerk in the\r\nemployment of Joseph Cuffe of 5 Smithfield for the superintendence of\r\nsales in the adjacent Dublin Cattle market on the North Circular road.\r\n\r\nHad he performed any special corporal work of mercy for her?\r\n\r\nHe had sometimes propelled her on warm summer evenings, an infirm widow\r\nof independent, if limited, means, in her convalescent bathchair\r\nwith slow revolutions of its wheels as far as the corner of the North\r\nCircular road opposite Mr Gavin Low\xe2\x80\x99s place of business where she had\r\nremained for a certain time scanning through his onelensed binocular\r\nfieldglasses unrecognisable citizens on tramcars, roadster bicycles\r\nequipped with inflated pneumatic tyres, hackney carriages, tandems,\r\nprivate and hired landaus, dogcarts, ponytraps and brakes passing from\r\nthe city to the Ph\xc5\x93nix Park and _vice versa_.\r\n\r\nWhy could he then support that his vigil with the greater equanimity?\r\n\r\nBecause in middle youth he had often sat observing through a rondel\r\nof bossed glass of a multicoloured pane the spectacle offered with\r\ncontinual changes of the thoroughfare without, pedestrians, quadrupeds,\r\nvelocipedes, vehicles, passing slowly, quickly, evenly, round and round\r\nand round the rim of a round and round precipitous globe.\r\n\r\nWhat distinct different memories had each of her now eight years\r\ndeceased?\r\n\r\nThe older, her bezique cards and counters, her Skye terrier, her\r\nsuppositious wealth, her lapses of responsiveness and incipient\r\ncatarrhal deafness: the younger, her lamp of colza oil before the statue\r\nof the Immaculate Conception, her green and maroon brushes for Charles\r\nStewart Parnell and for Michael Davitt, her tissue papers.\r\n\r\nWere there no means still remaining to him to achieve the rejuvenation\r\nwhich these reminiscences divulged to a younger companion rendered the\r\nmore desirable?\r\n\r\nThe indoor exercises, formerly intermittently practised, subsequently\r\nabandoned, prescribed in Eugen Sandow\xe2\x80\x99s Physical Strength and How to\r\nObtain It which, designed particularly for commercial men engaged in\r\nsedentary occupations, were to be made with mental concentration in\r\nfront of a mirror so as to bring into play the various families of\r\nmuscles and produce successively a pleasant rigidity, a more pleasant\r\nrelaxation and the most pleasant repristination of juvenile agility.\r\n\r\nHad any special agility been his in earlier youth?\r\n\r\nThough ringweight lifting had been beyond his strength and the full\r\ncircle gyration beyond his courage yet as a High school scholar he\r\nhad excelled in his stable and protracted execution of the half lever\r\nmovement on the parallel bars in consequence of his abnormally developed\r\nabdominal muscles.\r\n\r\nDid either openly allude to their racial difference?\r\n\r\nNeither.\r\n\r\nWhat, reduced to their simplest reciprocal form, were Bloom\xe2\x80\x99s thoughts\r\nabout Stephen\xe2\x80\x99s thoughts about Bloom and about Stephen\xe2\x80\x99s thoughts about\r\nBloom\xe2\x80\x99s thoughts about Stephen?\r\n\r\nHe thought that he thought that he was a jew whereas he knew that he\r\nknew that he knew that he was not.\r\n\r\nWhat, the enclosures of reticence removed, were their respective\r\nparentages?\r\n\r\nBloom, only born male transubstantial heir of Rudolf Virag (subsequently\r\nRudolph Bloom) of Szombathely, Vienna, Budapest, Milan, London and\r\nDublin and of Ellen Higgins, second daughter of Julius Higgins (born\r\nKaroly) and Fanny Higgins (born Hegarty). Stephen, eldest surviving male\r\nconsubstantial heir of Simon Dedalus of Cork and Dublin and of Mary,\r\ndaughter of Richard and Christina Goulding (born Grier).\r\n\r\nHad Bloom and Stephen been baptised, and where and by whom, cleric or\r\nlayman?\r\n\r\nBloom (three times), by the reverend Mr Gilmer Johnston M. A., alone,\r\nin the protestant church of Saint Nicholas Without, Coombe, by James\r\nO\xe2\x80\x99Connor, Philip Gilligan and James Fitzpatrick, together, under a pump\r\nin the village of Swords, and by the reverend Charles Malone C. C., in\r\nthe church of the Three Patrons, Rathgar. Stephen (once) by the reverend\r\nCharles Malone C. C., alone, in the church of the Three Patrons,\r\nRathgar.\r\n\r\nDid they find their educational careers similar?\r\n\r\nSubstituting Stephen for Bloom Stoom would have passed successively\r\nthrough a dame\xe2\x80\x99s school and the high school. Substituting Bloom for\r\nStephen Blephen would have passed successively through the preparatory,\r\njunior, middle and senior grades of the intermediate and through the\r\nmatriculation, first arts, second arts and arts degree courses of the\r\nroyal university.\r\n\r\nWhy did Bloom refrain from stating that he had frequented the university\r\nof life?\r\n\r\nBecause of his fluctuating incertitude as to whether this observation\r\nhad or had not been already made by him to Stephen or by Stephen to him.\r\n\r\nWhat two temperaments did they individually represent?\r\n\r\nThe scientific. The artistic.\r\n\r\nWhat proofs did Bloom adduce to prove that his tendency was towards\r\napplied, rather than towards pure, science?\r\n\r\nCertain possible inventions of which he had cogitated when reclining\r\nin a state of supine repletion to aid digestion, stimulated by his\r\nappreciation of the importance of inventions now common but once\r\nrevolutionary, for example, the aeronautic parachute, the reflecting\r\ntelescope, the spiral corkscrew, the safety pin, the mineral water\r\nsiphon, the canal lock with winch and sluice, the suction pump.\r\n\r\nWere these inventions principally intended for an improved scheme of\r\nkindergarten?\r\n\r\nYes, rendering obsolete popguns, elastic airbladders, games of hazard,\r\ncatapults. They comprised astronomical kaleidoscopes exhibiting the\r\ntwelve constellations of the zodiac from Aries to Pisces, miniature\r\nmechanical orreries, arithmetical gelatine lozenges, geometrical\r\nto correspond with zoological biscuits, globemap playing balls,\r\nhistorically costumed dolls.\r\n\r\nWhat also stimulated him in his cogitations?\r\n\r\nThe financial success achieved by Ephraim Marks and Charles A. James,\r\nthe former by his 1d bazaar at 42 George\xe2\x80\x99s street, south, the latter\r\nat his 6 1/2d shop and world\xe2\x80\x99s fancy fair and waxwork exhibition at 30\r\nHenry street, admission 2d, children 1d: and the infinite possibilities\r\nhitherto unexploited of the modern art of advertisement if condensed\r\nin triliteral monoideal symbols, vertically of maximum visibility\r\n(divined), horizontally of maximum legibility (deciphered) and of\r\nmagnetising efficacy to arrest involuntary attention, to interest, to\r\nconvince, to decide.\r\n\r\nSuch as?\r\n\r\nK. 11.

Nannetti, M. P., Rotunda\r\nWard, 19 Hardwicke street, under the obituary notices and anniversaries\r\nof deceases. The name on the label is Plumtree. A plumtree in a meatpot,\r\nregistered trade mark. Beware of imitations. Peatmot. Trumplee. Moutpat.\r\nPlamtroo.\r\n\r\nWhich example did he adduce to induce Stephen to deduce that\r\noriginality, though producing its own reward, does not invariably\r\nconduce to success?\r\n\r\nHis own ideated and rejected project of an illuminated showcart, drawn\r\nby a beast of burden, in which two smartly dressed girls were to be\r\nseated engaged in writing.\r\n\r\nWhat suggested scene was then constructed by Stephen?\r\n\r\nSolitary hotel in mountain pass. Autumn. Twilight. Fire lit. In dark\r\ncorner young man seated. Young woman enters. Restless. Solitary. She\r\nsits. She goes to window. She stands. She sits. Twilight. She thinks.\r\nOn solitary hotel paper she writes. She thinks. She writes. She sighs.\r\nWheels and hoofs. She hurries out. He comes from his dark corner. He\r\nseizes solitary paper. He holds it towards fire. Twilight. He reads.\r\nSolitary.\r\n\r\nWhat?\r\n\r\nIn sloping, upright and backhands: Queen\xe2\x80\x99s Hotel, Queen\xe2\x80\x99s Hotel, Queen\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nHotel. Queen\xe2\x80\x99s Ho...\r\n\r\nWhat suggested scene was then reconstructed by Bloom?\r\n\r\nThe Queen\xe2\x80\x99s Hotel, Ennis, county Clare, where Rudolph Bloom (Rudolf\r\nVirag) died on the evening of the 27 June 1886, at some hour unstated,\r\nin consequence of an overdose of monkshood (aconite) selfadministered in\r\nthe form of a neuralgic liniment composed of 2 parts of aconite liniment\r\nto 1 of chloroform liniment (purchased by him at 10.20 a.m. on the\r\nmorning of 27 June 1886 at the medical hall of Francis Dennehy, 17\r\nChurch street, Ennis) after having, though not in consequence of having,\r\npurchased at 3.15 p.m. on the afternoon of 27 June 1886 a new boater\r\nstraw hat, extra smart (after having, though not in consequence of\r\nhaving, purchased at the hour and in the place aforesaid, the toxin\r\naforesaid), at the general drapery store of James Cullen, 4 Main street,\r\nEnnis.\r\n\r\nDid he attribute this homonymity to information or coincidence or\r\nintuition?\r\n\r\nCoincidence.\r\n\r\nDid he depict the scene verbally for his guest to see?\r\n\r\nHe preferred himself to see another\xe2\x80\x99s face and listen to another\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nwords by which potential narration was realised and kinetic temperament\r\nrelieved.\r\n\r\nDid he see only a second coincidence in the second scene narrated to\r\nhim, described by the narrator as A Pisgah Sight of Palestine or The\r\nParable of the Plums?\r\n\r\nIt, with the preceding scene and with others unnarrated but existent by\r\nimplication, to which add essays on various subjects or moral apothegms\r\n(e.g. My Favourite Hero or Procrastination is the Thief of Time)\r\ncomposed during schoolyears, seemed to him to contain in itself and\r\nin conjunction with the personal equation certain possibilities of\r\nfinancial, social, personal and sexual success, whether specially\r\ncollected and selected as model pedagogic themes (of cent per cent\r\nmerit) for the use of preparatory and junior grade students or\r\ncontributed in printed form, following the precedent of Philip Beaufoy\r\nor Doctor Dick or Heblon\xe2\x80\x99s Studies in Blue, to a publication of\r\ncertified circulation and solvency or employed verbally as intellectual\r\nstimulation for sympathetic auditors, tacitly appreciative of successful\r\nnarrative and confidently augurative of successful achievement, during\r\nthe increasingly longer nights gradually following the summer solstice\r\non the day but three following, videlicet, Tuesday, 21 June (S. Aloysius\r\nGonzaga), sunrise 3.33 a.m., sunset 8.29 p.m.\r\n\r\nWhich domestic problem as much as, if not more than, any other\r\nfrequently engaged his mind?\r\n\r\nWhat to do with our wives.\r\n\r\nWhat had been his hypothetical singular solutions?\r\n\r\nParlour games (dominos, halma, tiddledywinks, spilikins, cup and ball,\r\nnap, spoil five, bezique, twentyfive, beggar my neighbour, draughts,\r\nchess or backgammon): embroidery, darning or knitting for the\r\npoliceaided clothing society: musical duets, mandoline and guitar, piano\r\nand flute, guitar and piano: legal scrivenery or envelope addressing:\r\nbiweekly visits to variety entertainments: commercial activity as\r\npleasantly commanding and pleasingly obeyed mistress proprietress in\r\na cool dairy shop or warm cigar divan: the clandestine satisfaction of\r\nerotic irritation in masculine brothels, state inspected and medically\r\ncontrolled: social visits, at regular infrequent prevented intervals\r\nand with regular frequent preventive superintendence, to and from female\r\nacquaintances of recognised respectability in the vicinity: courses of\r\nevening instruction specially designed to render liberal instruction\r\nagreeable.\r\n\r\nWhat instances of deficient mental development in his wife inclined him\r\nin favour of the lastmentioned (ninth) solution?\r\n\r\nIn disoccupied moments she had more than once covered a sheet of paper\r\nwith signs and hieroglyphics which she stated were Greek and Irish and\r\nHebrew characters. She had interrogated constantly at varying intervals\r\nas to the correct method of writing the capital initial of the name of\r\na city in Canada, Quebec. She understood little of political\r\ncomplications, internal, or balance of power, external. In calculating\r\nthe addenda of bills she frequently had recourse to digital aid.\r\nAfter completion of laconic epistolary compositions she abandoned\r\nthe implement of calligraphy in the encaustic pigment, exposed to\r\nthe corrosive action of copperas, green vitriol and nutgall. Unusual\r\npolysyllables of foreign origin she interpreted phonetically or by\r\nfalse analogy or by both: metempsychosis (met him pike hoses), alias (a\r\nmendacious person mentioned in sacred scripture).\r\n\r\nWhat compensated in the false balance of her intelligence for these and\r\nsuch deficiencies of judgment regarding persons, places and things?\r\n\r\nThe false apparent parallelism of all perpendicular arms of all\r\nbalances, proved true by construction. The counterbalance of her\r\nproficiency of judgment regarding one person, proved true by experiment.\r\n\r\nHow had he attempted to remedy this state of comparative ignorance?\r\n\r\nVariously. By leaving in a conspicuous place a certain book open at a\r\ncertain page: by assuming in her, when alluding explanatorily, latent\r\nknowledge: by open ridicule in her presence of some absent other\xe2\x80\x99s\r\nignorant lapse.\r\n\r\nWith what success had he attempted direct instruction?\r\n\r\nShe followed not all, a part of the whole, gave attention with interest\r\ncomprehended with surprise, with care repeated, with greater difficulty\r\nremembered, forgot with ease, with misgiving reremembered, rerepeated\r\nwith error.\r\n\r\nWhat system had proved more effective?\r\n\r\nIndirect suggestion implicating selfinterest.\r\n\r\nExample?\r\n\r\nShe disliked umbrella with rain, he liked woman with umbrella, she\r\ndisliked new hat with rain, he liked woman with new hat, he bought new\r\nhat with rain, she carried umbrella with new hat.\r\n\r\nAccepting the analogy implied in his guest\xe2\x80\x99s parable which examples of\r\npostexilic eminence did he adduce?\r\n\r\nThree seekers of the pure truth, Moses of Egypt, Moses Maimonides,\r\nauthor of More Nebukim (Guide of the Perplexed) and Moses Mendelssohn\r\nof such eminence that from Moses (of Egypt) to Moses (Mendelssohn) there\r\narose none like Moses (Maimonides).\r\n\r\nWhat statement was made, under correction, by Bloom concerning a fourth\r\nseeker of pure truth, by name Aristotle, mentioned, with permission, by\r\nStephen?\r\n\r\nThat the seeker mentioned had been a pupil of a rabbinical philosopher,\r\nname uncertain.\r\n\r\nWere other anapocryphal illustrious sons of the law and children of a\r\nselected or rejected race mentioned?\r\n\r\nFelix Bartholdy Mendelssohn (composer), Baruch Spinoza (philosopher),\r\nMendoza (pugilist), Ferdinand Lassalle (reformer, duellist).\r\n\r\nWhat fragments of verse from the ancient Hebrew and ancient Irish\r\nlanguages were cited with modulations of voice and translation of texts\r\nby guest to host and by host to guest?\r\n\r\nBy Stephen: suil, suil, suil arun, suil go siocair agus suil go cuin\r\n(walk, walk, walk your way, walk in safety, walk with care).\r\n\r\nBy Bloom: Kifeloch, harimon rakatejch m\xe2\x80\x99baad l\xe2\x80\x99zamatejch (thy temple\r\namid thy hair is as a slice of pomegranate).\r\n\r\nHow was a glyphic comparison of the phonic symbols of both languages\r\nmade in substantiation of the oral comparison?\r\n\r\nBy juxtaposition. On the penultimate blank page of a book of inferior\r\nliterary style, entituled Sweets of Sin (produced by Bloom and so\r\nmanipulated that its front cover came in contact with the surface of\r\nthe table) with a pencil (supplied by Stephen) Stephen wrote the Irish\r\ncharacters for gee, eh, dee, em, simple and modified, and Bloom in turn\r\nwrote the Hebrew characters ghimel, aleph, daleth and (in the absence of\r\nmem) a substituted qoph, explaining their arithmetical values as ordinal\r\nand cardinal numbers, videlicet 3, 1, 4, and 100.\r\n\r\nWas the knowledge possessed by both of each of these languages, the\r\nextinct and the revived, theoretical or practical?\r\n\r\nTheoretical, being confined to certain grammatical rules of accidence\r\nand syntax and practically excluding vocabulary.\r\n\r\nWhat points of contact existed between these languages and between the\r\npeoples who spoke them?\r\n\r\nThe presence of guttural sounds, diacritic aspirations, epenthetic and\r\nservile letters in both languages: their antiquity, both having been\r\ntaught on the plain of Shinar 242 years after the deluge in the seminary\r\ninstituted by Fenius Farsaigh, descendant of Noah, progenitor of Israel,\r\nand ascendant of Heber and Heremon, progenitors of Ireland: their\r\narchaeological, genealogical, hagiographical, exegetical, homiletic,\r\ntoponomastic, historical and religious literatures comprising the works\r\nof rabbis and culdees, Torah, Talmud (Mischna and Ghemara), Massor,\r\nPentateuch, Book of the Dun Cow, Book of Ballymote, Garland of Howth,\r\nBook of Kells: their dispersal, persecution, survival and revival: the\r\nisolation of their synagogical and ecclesiastical rites in ghetto (S.\r\nMary\xe2\x80\x99s Abbey) and masshouse (Adam and Eve\xe2\x80\x99s tavern): the proscription\r\nof their national costumes in penal laws and jewish dress acts: the\r\nrestoration in Chanah David of Zion and the possibility of Irish\r\npolitical autonomy or devolution.\r\n\r\nWhat anthem did Bloom chant partially in anticipation of that multiple,\r\nethnically irreducible consummation?\r\n\r\n     Kolod balejwaw pnimah\r\n     Nefesch, jehudi, homijah.\r\n\r\nWhy was the chant arrested at the conclusion of this first distich?\r\n\r\nIn consequence of defective mnemotechnic.\r\n\r\nHow did the chanter compensate for this deficiency?\r\n\r\nBy a periphrastic version of the general text.\r\n\r\nIn what common study did their mutual reflections merge?\r\n\r\nThe increasing simplification traceable from the Egyptian epigraphic\r\nhieroglyphs to the Greek and Roman alphabets and the anticipation of\r\nmodern stenography and telegraphic code in the cuneiform inscriptions\r\n(Semitic) and the virgular quinquecostate ogham writing (Celtic).\r\n\r\nDid the guest comply with his host\xe2\x80\x99s request?\r\n\r\nDoubly, by appending his signature in Irish and Roman characters.\r\n\r\nWhat was Stephen\xe2\x80\x99s auditive sensation?\r\n\r\nHe heard in a profound ancient male unfamiliar melody the accumulation\r\nof the past.\r\n\r\nWhat was Bloom\xe2\x80\x99s visual sensation?\r\n\r\nHe saw in a quick young male familiar form the predestination of a\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\nWhat were Stephen\xe2\x80\x99s and Bloom\xe2\x80\x99s quasisimultaneous volitional\r\nquasisensations of concealed identities?\r\n\r\nVisually, Stephen\xe2\x80\x99s: The traditional figure of hypostasis, depicted\r\nby Johannes Damascenus, Lentulus Romanus and Epiphanius Monachus as\r\nleucodermic, sesquipedalian with winedark hair.\r\n\r\nAuditively, Bloom\xe2\x80\x99s: The traditional accent of the ecstasy of\r\ncatastrophe.\r\n\r\nWhat future careers had been possible for Bloom in the past and with\r\nwhat exemplars?\r\n\r\nIn the church, Roman, Anglican or Nonconformist: exemplars, the very\r\nreverend John Conmee S. J., the reverend T. Salmon, D. D., provost of\r\nTrinity college, Dr Alexander J. Dowie. At the bar, English or Irish:\r\nexemplars, Seymour Bushe, K. C., Rufus Isaacs, K. C. On the stage,\r\nmodern or Shakespearean: exemplars, Charles Wyndham, high comedian,\r\nOsmond Tearle (\xe2\x80\xa0 1901), exponent of Shakespeare.\r\n\r\nDid the host encourage his guest to chant in a modulated voice a strange\r\nlegend on an allied theme?\r\n\r\nReassuringly, their place, where none could hear them talk, being\r\nsecluded, reassured, the decocted beverages, allowing for subsolid\r\nresidual sediment of a mechanical mixture, water plus sugar plus cream\r\nplus cocoa, having been consumed.\r\n\r\nRecite the first (major) part of this chanted legend.\r\n\r\n     Little Harry Hughes and his schoolfellows all\r\n     Went out for to play ball.\r\n     And the very first ball little Harry Hughes played\r\n     He drove it o\xe2\x80\x99er the jew\xe2\x80\x99s garden wall.\r\n     And the very second ball little Harry Hughes played\r\n     He broke the jew\xe2\x80\x99s windows all.\r\n\r\nHow did the son of Rudolph receive this first part?\r\n\r\nWith unmixed feeling. Smiling, a jew, he heard with pleasure and saw the\r\nunbroken kitchen window.\r\n\r\nRecite the second part (minor) of the legend.\r\n\r\n     Then out there came the jew\xe2\x80\x99s daughter\r\n     And she all dressed in green.\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cCome back, come back, you pretty little boy,\r\n     And play your ball again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n     \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t come back and I won\xe2\x80\x99t come back\r\n     Without my schoolfellows all.\r\n     For if my master he did hear\r\n     He\xe2\x80\x99d make it a sorry ball.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n\r\n     She took him by the lilywhite hand\r\n     And led him along the hall\r\n     Until she led him to a room\r\n     Where none could hear him call.\r\n\r\n     She took a penknife out of her pocket\r\n     And cut off his little head.\r\n     And now he\xe2\x80\x99ll play his ball no more\r\n     For he lies among the dead.\r\n\r\nHow did the father of Millicent receive this second part?\r\n\r\nWith mixed feelings. Unsmiling, he heard and saw with wonder a jew\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndaughter, all dressed in green.\r\n\r\nCondense Stephen\xe2\x80\x99s commentary.\r\n\r\nOne of all, the least of all, is the victim predestined. Once by\r\ninadvertence twice by design he challenges his destiny. It comes when he\r\nis abandoned and challenges him reluctant and, as an apparition of hope\r\nand youth, holds him unresisting. It leads him to a strange habitation,\r\nto a secret infidel apartment, and there, implacable, immolates him,\r\nconsenting.\r\n\r\nWhy was the host (victim predestined) sad?\r\n\r\nHe wished that a tale of a deed should be told of a deed not by him\r\nshould by him not be told.\r\n\r\nWhy was the host (reluctant, unresisting) still?\r\n\r\nIn accordance with the law of the conservation of energy.\r\n\r\nWhy was the host (secret infidel) silent?\r\n\r\nHe weighed the possible evidences for and against ritual murder: the\r\nincitations of the hierarchy, the superstition of the populace, the\r\npropagation of rumour in continued fraction of veridicity, the envy of\r\nopulence, the influence of retaliation, the sporadic reappearance of\r\natavistic delinquency, the mitigating circumstances of fanaticism,\r\nhypnotic suggestion and somnambulism.\r\n\r\nFrom which (if any) of these mental or physical disorders was he not\r\ntotally immune?\r\n\r\nFrom hypnotic suggestion: once, waking, he had not recognised his\r\nsleeping apartment: more than once, waking, he had been for an\r\nindefinite time incapable of moving or uttering sounds. From\r\nsomnambulism: once, sleeping, his body had risen, crouched and\r\ncrawled in the direction of a heatless fire and, having attained\r\nits destination, there, curled, unheated, in night attire had lain,\r\nsleeping.\r\n\r\nHad this latter or any cognate phenomenon declared itself in any member\r\nof his family?\r\n\r\nTwice, in Holles street and in Ontario terrace, his daughter Millicent\r\n(Milly) at the ages of 6 and 8 years had uttered in sleep an exclamation\r\nof terror and had replied to the interrogations of two figures in night\r\nattire with a vacant mute expression.\r\n\r\nWhat other infantile memories had he of her?\r\n\r\n15 June 1889. A querulous newborn female infant crying to cause and\r\nlessen congestion. A child renamed Padney Socks she shook with shocks\r\nher moneybox: counted his three free moneypenny buttons, one, tloo,\r\ntlee: a doll, a boy, a sailor she cast away: blond, born of two dark,\r\nshe had blond ancestry, remote, a violation, Herr Hauptmann Hainau,\r\nAustrian army, proximate, a hallucination, lieutenant Mulvey, British\r\nnavy.\r\n\r\nWhat endemic characteristics were present?\r\n\r\nConversely the nasal and frontal formation was derived in a direct\r\nline of lineage which, though interrupted, would continue at distant\r\nintervals to more distant intervals to its most distant intervals.\r\n\r\nWhat memories had he of her adolescence?\r\n\r\nShe relegated her hoop and skippingrope to a recess. On the duke\xe2\x80\x99s lawn,\r\nentreated by an English visitor, she declined to permit him to make and\r\ntake away her photographic image (objection not stated). On the South\r\nCircular road in the company of Elsa Potter, followed by an individual\r\nof sinister aspect, she went half way down Stamer street and turned\r\nabruptly back (reason of change not stated). On the vigil of the 15th\r\nanniversary of her birth she wrote a letter from Mullingar, county\r\nWestmeath, making a brief allusion to a local student (faculty and year\r\nnot stated).\r\n\r\nDid that first division, portending a second division, afflict him?\r\n\r\nLess than he had imagined, more than he had hoped.\r\n\r\nWhat second departure was contemporaneously perceived by him similarly,\r\nif differently?\r\n\r\nA temporary departure of his cat.\r\n\r\nWhy similarly, why differently?\r\n\r\nSimilarly, because actuated by a secret purpose the quest of a new\r\nmale (Mullingar student) or of a healing herb (valerian). Differently,\r\nbecause of different possible returns to the inhabitants or to the\r\nhabitation.\r\n\r\nIn other respects were their differences similar?\r\n\r\nIn passivity, in economy, in the instinct of tradition, in\r\nunexpectedness.\r\n\r\nAs?\r\n\r\nInasmuch as leaning she sustained her blond hair for him to ribbon it\r\nfor her (cf neckarching cat). Moreover, on the free surface of the lake\r\nin Stephen\xe2\x80\x99s green amid inverted reflections of trees her uncommented\r\nspit, describing concentric circles of waterrings, indicated by the\r\nconstancy of its permanence the locus of a somnolent prostrate fish (cf\r\nmousewatching cat). Again, in order to remember the date, combatants,\r\nissue and consequences of a famous military engagement she pulled a\r\nplait of her hair (cf earwashing cat). Furthermore, silly Milly, she\r\ndreamed of having had an unspoken unremembered conversation with a horse\r\nwhose name had been Joseph to whom (which) she had offered a\r\ntumblerful of lemonade which it (he) had appeared to have accepted (cf\r\nhearthdreaming cat). Hence, in passivity, in economy, in the instinct of\r\ntradition, in unexpectedness, their differences were similar.\r\n\r\nIn what way had he utilised gifts (1) an owl, 2) a clock, given as\r\nmatrimonial auguries, to interest and to instruct her?\r\n\r\nAs object lessons to explain: 1) the nature and habits of oviparous\r\nanimals, the possibility of aerial flight, certain abnormalities of\r\nvision, the secular process of imbalsamation: 2) the principle of the\r\npendulum, exemplified in bob, wheelgear and regulator, the translation\r\nin terms of human or social regulation of the various positions of\r\nclockwise moveable indicators on an unmoving dial, the exactitude of the\r\nrecurrence per hour of an instant in each hour when the longer and the\r\nshorter indicator were at the same angle of inclination, videlicet, 5\r\n5/11 minutes past each hour per hour in arithmetical progression.\r\n\r\nIn what manners did she reciprocate?\r\n\r\nShe remembered: on the 27th anniversary of his birth she presented to\r\nhim a breakfast moustachecup of imitation Crown Derby porcelain ware.\r\nShe provided: at quarter day or thereabouts if or when purchases\r\nhad been made by him not for her she showed herself attentive to his\r\nnecessities, anticipating his desires. She admired: a natural phenomenon\r\nhaving been explained by him to her she expressed the immediate desire\r\nto possess without gradual acquisition a fraction of his science, the\r\nmoiety, the quarter, a thousandth part.\r\n\r\nWhat proposal did Bloom, diambulist, father of Milly, somnambulist, make\r\nto Stephen, noctambulist?\r\n\r\nTo pass in repose the hours intervening between Thursday (proper) and\r\nFriday (normal) on an extemporised cubicle in the apartment immediately\r\nabove the kitchen and immediately adjacent to the sleeping apartment of\r\nhis host and hostess.\r\n\r\nWhat various advantages would or might have resulted from a prolongation\r\nof such an extemporisation?\r\n\r\nFor the guest: security of domicile and seclusion of study. For the\r\nhost: rejuvenation of intelligence, vicarious satisfaction. For the\r\nhostess: disintegration of obsession, acquisition of correct Italian\r\npronunciation.\r\n\r\nWhy might these several provisional contingencies between a guest and\r\na hostess not necessarily preclude or be precluded by a permanent\r\neventuality of reconciliatory union between a schoolfellow and a jew\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ndaughter?\r\n\r\nBecause the way to daughter led through mother, the way to mother\r\nthrough daughter.\r\n\r\nTo what inconsequent polysyllabic question of his host did the guest\r\nreturn a monosyllabic negative answer?\r\n\r\nIf he had known the late Mrs Emily Sinico, accidentally killed at Sydney\r\nParade railway station, 14 October 1903.\r\n\r\nWhat inchoate corollary statement was consequently suppressed by the\r\nhost?\r\n\r\nA statement explanatory of his absence on the occasion of the interment\r\nof Mrs Mary Dedalus (born Goulding), 26 June 1903, vigil of the\r\nanniversary of the decease of Rudolph Bloom (born Virag).\r\n\r\nWas the proposal of asylum accepted?\r\n\r\nPromptly, inexplicably, with amicability, gratefully it was declined.\r\n\r\nWhat exchange of money took place between host and guest?\r\n\r\nThe former returned to the latter, without interest, a sum of money (\xc2\xa3\r\n1-7-0), one pound seven shillings sterling, advanced by the latter to\r\nthe former.\r\n\r\nWhat counterproposals were alternately advanced, accepted, modified,\r\ndeclined, restated in other terms, reaccepted, ratified, reconfirmed?\r\n\r\nTo inaugurate a prearranged course of Italian instruction, place\r\nthe residence of the instructed. To inaugurate a course of vocal\r\ninstruction, place the residence of the instructress. To inaugurate a\r\nseries of static, semistatic and peripatetic intellectual dialogues,\r\nplaces the residence of both speakers (if both speakers were resident in\r\nthe same place), the Ship hotel and tavern, 6 Lower Abbey street (W. and\r\nE. Connery, proprietors), the National Library of Ireland, 10 Kildare\r\nstreet, the National Maternity Hospital, 29, 30 and 31 Holles street, a\r\npublic garden, the vicinity of a place of worship, a conjunction of two\r\nor more public thoroughfares, the point of bisection of a right line\r\ndrawn between their residences (if both speakers were resident in\r\ndifferent places).\r\n\r\nWhat rendered problematic for Bloom the realisation of these mutually\r\nselfexcluding propositions?\r\n\r\nThe irreparability of the past: once at a performance of Albert\r\nHengler\xe2\x80\x99s circus in the Rotunda, Rutland square, Dublin, an intuitive\r\nparticoloured clown in quest of paternity had penetrated from the ring\r\nto a place in the auditorium where Bloom, solitary, was seated and had\r\npublicly declared to an exhilarated audience that he (Bloom) was his\r\n(the clown\xe2\x80\x99s) papa. The imprevidibility of the future: once in the\r\nsummer of 1898 he (Bloom) had marked a florin (2/-) with three notches\r\non the milled edge and tendered it in payment of an account due to and\r\nreceived by J. and T. Davy, family grocers, 1 Charlemont Mall, Grand\r\nCanal, for circulation on the waters of civic finance, for possible,\r\ncircuitous or direct, return.\r\n\r\nWas the clown Bloom\xe2\x80\x99s son?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\nHad Bloom\xe2\x80\x99s coin returned?\r\n\r\nNever.\r\n\r\nWhy would a recurrent frustration the more depress him?\r\n\r\nBecause at the critical turningpoint of human existence he desired to\r\namend many social conditions, the product of inequality and avarice and\r\ninternational animosity.\r\n\r\nHe believed then that human life was infinitely perfectible, eliminating\r\nthese conditions?\r\n\r\nThere remained the generic conditions imposed by natural, as distinct\r\nfrom human law, as integral parts of the human whole: the necessity of\r\ndestruction to procure alimentary sustenance: the painful character of\r\nthe ultimate functions of separate existence, the agonies of birth and\r\ndeath: the monotonous menstruation of simian and (particularly) human\r\nfemales extending from the age of puberty to the menopause: inevitable\r\naccidents at sea, in mines and factories: certain very painful maladies\r\nand their resultant surgical operations, innate lunacy and congenital\r\ncriminality, decimating epidemics: catastrophic cataclysms which make\r\nterror the basis of human mentality: seismic upheavals the epicentres\r\nof which are located in densely populated regions: the fact of vital\r\ngrowth, through convulsions of metamorphosis, from infancy through\r\nmaturity to decay.\r\n\r\nWhy did he desist from speculation?\r\n\r\nBecause it was a task for a superior intelligence to substitute other\r\nmore acceptable phenomena in the place of the less acceptable phenomena\r\nto be removed.\r\n\r\nDid Stephen participate in his dejection?\r\n\r\nHe affirmed his significance as a conscious rational animal proceeding\r\nsyllogistically from the known to the unknown and a conscious rational\r\nreagent between a micro and a macrocosm ineluctably constructed upon the\r\nincertitude of the void.\r\n\r\nWas this affirmation apprehended by Bloom?\r\n\r\nNot verbally. Substantially.\r\n\r\nWhat comforted his misapprehension?\r\n\r\nThat as a competent keyless citizen he had proceeded energetically from\r\nthe unknown to the known through the incertitude of the void.\r\n\r\nIn what order of precedence, with what attendant ceremony was the exodus\r\nfrom the house of bondage to the wilderness of inhabitation effected?\r\n\r\n      Lighted Candle in Stick\r\n      borne by\r\n      BLOOM\r\n      Diaconal Hat on Ashplant\r\n      borne by\r\n      STEPHEN\r\n\r\nWith what intonation secreto of what commemorative psalm?\r\n\r\nThe 113th, modus peregrinus: In exitu Isra\xc3\xabl de Egypto: domus Jacob de\r\npopulo barbaro.\r\n\r\nWhat did each do at the door of egress?\r\n\r\nBloom set the candlestick on the floor. Stephen put the hat on his head.\r\n\r\nFor what creature was the door of egress a door of ingress?\r\n\r\nFor a cat.\r\n\r\nWhat spectacle confronted them when they, first the host, then the\r\nguest, emerged silently, doubly dark, from obscurity by a passage from\r\nthe rere of the house into the penumbra of the garden?\r\n\r\nThe heaventree of stars hung with humid nightblue fruit.\r\n\r\nWith what meditations did Bloom accompany his demonstration to his\r\ncompanion of various constellations?\r\n\r\nMeditations of evolution increasingly vaster: of the moon invisible in\r\nincipient lunation, approaching perigee: of the infinite lattiginous\r\nscintillating uncondensed milky way, discernible by daylight by an\r\nobserver placed at the lower end of a cylindrical vertical shaft 5000\r\nft deep sunk from the surface towards the centre of the earth: of Sirius\r\n(alpha in Canis Maior) 10 lightyears (57,000,000,000,000 miles) distant\r\nand in volume 900 times the dimension of our planet: of Arcturus: of the\r\nprecession of equinoxes: of Orion with belt and sextuple sun theta and\r\nnebula in which 100 of our solar systems could be contained: of moribund\r\nand of nascent new stars such as Nova in 1901: of our system plunging\r\ntowards the constellation of Hercules: of the parallax or parallactic\r\ndrift of socalled fixed stars, in reality evermoving wanderers from\r\nimmeasurably remote eons to infinitely remote futures in comparison with\r\nwhich the years, threescore and ten, of allotted human life formed a\r\nparenthesis of infinitesimal brevity.\r\n\r\nWere there obverse meditations of involution increasingly less vast?\r\n\r\nOf the eons of geological periods recorded in the stratifications of the\r\nearth: of the myriad minute entomological organic existences concealed\r\nin cavities of the earth, beneath removable stones, in hives and mounds,\r\nof microbes, germs, bacteria, bacilli, spermatozoa: of the incalculable\r\ntrillions of billions of millions of imperceptible molecules contained\r\nby cohesion of molecular affinity in a single pinhead: of the universe\r\nof human serum constellated with red and white bodies, themselves\r\nuniverses of void space constellated with other bodies, each, in\r\ncontinuity, its universe of divisible component bodies of which each was\r\nagain divisible in divisions of redivisible component bodies, dividends\r\nand divisors ever diminishing without actual division till, if the\r\nprogress were carried far enough, nought nowhere was never reached.\r\n\r\nWhy did he not elaborate these calculations to a more precise result?\r\n\r\nBecause some years previously in 1886 when occupied with the problem of\r\nthe quadrature of the circle he had learned of the existence of a number\r\ncomputed to a relative degree of accuracy to be of such magnitude and\r\nof so many places, e.g., the 9th power of the 9th power of 9, that, the\r\nresult having been obtained, 33 closely printed volumes of 1000 pages\r\neach of innumerable quires and reams of India paper would have to be\r\nrequisitioned in order to contain the complete tale of its printed\r\nintegers of units, tens, hundreds, thousands, tens of thousands,\r\nhundreds of thousands, millions, tens of millions, hundreds of millions,\r\nbillions, the nucleus of the nebula of every digit of every series\r\ncontaining succinctly the potentiality of being raised to the utmost\r\nkinetic elaboration of any power of any of its powers.\r\n\r\nDid he find the problems of the inhabitability of the planets and their\r\nsatellites by a race, given in species, and of the possible social and\r\nmoral redemption of said race by a redeemer, easier of solution?\r\n\r\nOf a different order of difficulty. Conscious that the human organism,\r\nnormally capable of sustaining an atmospheric pressure of 19 tons,\r\nwhen elevated to a considerable altitude in the terrestrial atmosphere\r\nsuffered with arithmetical progression of intensity, according as\r\nthe line of demarcation between troposphere and stratosphere was\r\napproximated from nasal hemorrhage, impeded respiration and vertigo,\r\nwhen proposing this problem for solution, he had conjectured as a\r\nworking hypothesis which could not be proved impossible that a more\r\nadaptable and differently anatomically constructed race of beings might\r\nsubsist otherwise under Martian, Mercurial, Veneral, Jovian, Saturnian,\r\nNeptunian or Uranian sufficient and equivalent conditions, though\r\nan apogean humanity of beings created in varying forms with finite\r\ndifferences resulting similar to the whole and to one another would\r\nprobably there as here remain inalterably and inalienably attached to\r\nvanities, to vanities of vanities and to all that is vanity.\r\n\r\nAnd the problem of possible redemption? The minor was proved by the\r\nmajor.\r\n\r\nWhich various features of the constellations were in turn considered?\r\n\r\nThe various colours significant of various degrees of vitality (white,\r\nyellow, crimson, vermilion, cinnabar): their degrees of brilliancy:\r\ntheir magnitudes revealed up to and including the 7th: their positions:\r\nthe waggoner\xe2\x80\x99s star: Walsingham way: the chariot of David: the annular\r\ncinctures of Saturn: the condensation of spiral nebulae into suns: the\r\ninterdependent gyrations of double suns: the independent synchronous\r\ndiscoveries of Galileo, Simon Marius, Piazzi, Le Verrier, Herschel,\r\nGalle: the systematisations attempted by Bode and Kepler of cubes\r\nof distances and squares of times of revolution: the almost infinite\r\ncompressibility of hirsute comets and their vast elliptical egressive\r\nand reentrant orbits from perihelion to aphelion: the sidereal origin of\r\nmeteoric stones: the Libyan floods on Mars about the period of the birth\r\nof the younger astroscopist: the annual recurrence of meteoric showers\r\nabout the period of the feast of S. Lawrence (martyr, 10 August): the\r\nmonthly recurrence known as the new moon with the old moon in her arms:\r\nthe posited influence of celestial on human bodies: the appearance of a\r\nstar (1st magnitude) of exceeding brilliancy dominating by night and\r\nday (a new luminous sun generated by the collision and amalgamation in\r\nincandescence of two nonluminous exsuns) about the period of the\r\nbirth of William Shakespeare over delta in the recumbent neversetting\r\nconstellation of Cassiopeia and of a star (2nd magnitude) of similar\r\norigin but of lesser brilliancy which had appeared in and disappeared\r\nfrom the constellation of the Corona Septentrionalis about the period\r\nof the birth of Leopold Bloom and of other stars of (presumably) similar\r\norigin which had (effectively or presumably) appeared in and disappeared\r\nfrom the constellation of Andromeda about the period of the birth of\r\nStephen Dedalus, and in and from the constellation of Auriga some years\r\nafter the birth and death of Rudolph Bloom, junior, and in and from\r\nother constellations some years before or after the birth or death of\r\nother persons: the attendant phenomena of eclipses, solar and lunar,\r\nfrom immersion to emersion, abatement of wind, transit of shadow,\r\ntaciturnity of winged creatures, emergence of nocturnal or crepuscular\r\nanimals, persistence of infernal light, obscurity of terrestrial waters,\r\npallor of human beings.\r\n\r\nHis (Bloom\xe2\x80\x99s) logical conclusion, having weighed the matter and allowing\r\nfor possible error?\r\n\r\nThat it was not a heaventree, not a heavengrot, not a heavenbeast, not\r\na heavenman. That it was a Utopia, there being no known method from\r\nthe known to the unknown: an infinity renderable equally finite by the\r\nsuppositious apposition of one or more bodies equally of the same and of\r\ndifferent magnitudes: a mobility of illusory forms immobilised in space,\r\nremobilised in air: a past which possibly had ceased to exist as a\r\npresent before its probable spectators had entered actual present\r\nexistence.\r\n\r\nWas he more convinced of the esthetic value of the spectacle?\r\n\r\nIndubitably in consequence of the reiterated examples of poets in the\r\ndelirium of the frenzy of attachment or in the abasement of rejection\r\ninvoking ardent sympathetic constellations or the frigidity of the\r\nsatellite of their planet.\r\n\r\nDid he then accept as an article of belief the theory of astrological\r\ninfluences upon sublunary disasters?\r\n\r\nIt seemed to him as possible of proof as of confutation and the\r\nnomenclature employed in its selenographical charts as attributable to\r\nverifiable intuition as to fallacious analogy: the lake of dreams, the\r\nsea of rains, the gulf of dews, the ocean of fecundity.\r\n\r\nWhat special affinities appeared to him to exist between the moon and\r\nwoman?\r\n\r\nHer antiquity in preceding and surviving successive tellurian\r\ngenerations: her nocturnal predominance: her satellitic dependence:\r\nher luminary reflection: her constancy under all her phases, rising\r\nand setting by her appointed times, waxing and waning: the forced\r\ninvariability of her aspect: her indeterminate response to inaffirmative\r\ninterrogation: her potency over effluent and refluent waters: her power\r\nto enamour, to mortify, to invest with beauty, to render insane, to\r\nincite to and aid delinquency: the tranquil inscrutability of her\r\nvisage: the terribility of her isolated dominant implacable resplendent\r\npropinquity: her omens of tempest and of calm: the stimulation of her\r\nlight, her motion and her presence: the admonition of her craters, her\r\narid seas, her silence: her splendour, when visible: her attraction,\r\nwhen invisible.\r\n\r\nWhat visible luminous sign attracted Bloom\xe2\x80\x99s, who attracted Stephen\xe2\x80\x99s,\r\ngaze?\r\n\r\nIn the second storey (rere) of his (Bloom\xe2\x80\x99s) house the light of a\r\nparaffin oil lamp with oblique shade projected on a screen of roller\r\nblind supplied by Frank O\xe2\x80\x99Hara, window blind, curtain pole and revolving\r\nshutter manufacturer, 16 Aungier street.\r\n\r\nHow did he elucidate the mystery of an invisible attractive person, his\r\nwife Marion (Molly) Bloom, denoted by a visible splendid sign, a lamp?\r\n\r\nWith indirect and direct verbal allusions or affirmations: with subdued\r\naffection and admiration: with description: with impediment: with\r\nsuggestion.\r\n\r\nBoth then were silent?\r\n\r\nSilent, each contemplating the other in both mirrors of the reciprocal\r\nflesh of theirhisnothis fellowfaces.\r\n\r\nWere they indefinitely inactive?\r\n\r\nAt Stephen\xe2\x80\x99s suggestion, at Bloom\xe2\x80\x99s instigation both, first Stephen,\r\nthen Bloom, in penumbra urinated, their sides contiguous, their organs\r\nof micturition reciprocally rendered invisible by manual circumposition,\r\ntheir gazes, first Bloom\xe2\x80\x99s, then Stephen\xe2\x80\x99s, elevated to the projected\r\nluminous and semiluminous shadow.\r\n\r\nSimilarly?\r\n\r\nThe trajectories of their, first sequent, then simultaneous, urinations\r\nwere dissimilar: Bloom\xe2\x80\x99s longer, less irruent, in the incomplete form of\r\nthe bifurcated penultimate alphabetical letter, who in his ultimate\r\nyear at High School (1880) had been capable of attaining the point\r\nof greatest altitude against the whole concurrent strength of the\r\ninstitution, 210 scholars: Stephen\xe2\x80\x99s higher, more sibilant, who in the\r\nultimate hours of the previous day had augmented by diuretic consumption\r\nan insistent vesical pressure.\r\n\r\nWhat different problems presented themselves to each concerning the\r\ninvisible audible collateral organ of the other?\r\n\r\nTo Bloom: the problems of irritability, tumescence, rigidity,\r\nreactivity, dimension, sanitariness, pilosity.\r\n\r\nTo Stephen: the problem of the sacerdotal integrity of Jesus circumcised\r\n(1 January, holiday of obligation to hear mass and abstain from\r\nunnecessary servile work) and the problem as to whether the divine\r\nprepuce, the carnal bridal ring of the holy Roman catholic apostolic\r\nchurch, conserved in Calcata, were deserving of simple hyperduly or of\r\nthe fourth degree of latria accorded to the abscission of such divine\r\nexcrescences as hair and toenails.\r\n\r\nWhat celestial sign was by both simultaneously observed?\r\n\r\nA star precipitated with great apparent velocity across the firmament\r\nfrom Vega in the Lyre above the zenith beyond the stargroup of the Tress\r\nof Berenice towards the zodiacal sign of Leo.\r\n\r\nHow did the centripetal remainer afford egress to the centrifugal\r\ndeparter?\r\n\r\nBy inserting the barrel of an arruginated male key in the hole of an\r\nunstable female lock, obtaining a purchase on the bow of the key and\r\nturning its wards from right to left, withdrawing a bolt from its\r\nstaple, pulling inward spasmodically an obsolescent unhinged door and\r\nrevealing an aperture for free egress and free ingress.\r\n\r\nHow did they take leave, one of the other, in separation?\r\n\r\nStanding perpendicular at the same door and on different sides of its\r\nbase, the lines of their valedictory arms, meeting at any point and\r\nforming any angle less than the sum of two right angles.\r\n\r\nWhat sound accompanied the union of their tangent, the disunion of their\r\n(respectively) centrifugal and centripetal hands?\r\n\r\nThe sound of the peal of the hour of the night by the chime of the bells\r\nin the church of Saint George.\r\n\r\nWhat echoes of that sound were by both and each heard?\r\n\r\nBy Stephen:\r\n\r\n      Liliata rutilantium. Turma circumdet.\r\n      Iubilantium te virginum. Chorus excipiat.\r\n\r\nBy Bloom:\r\n\r\n     Heigho, heigho,\r\n     Heigho, heigho.\r\n\r\nWhere were the several members of the company which with Bloom that day\r\nat the bidding of that peal had travelled from Sandymount in the south\r\nto Glasnevin in the north?\r\n\r\nMartin Cunningham (in bed), Jack Power (in bed), Simon Dedalus (in bed),\r\nNed Lambert (in bed), Tom Kernan (in bed), Joe Hynes (in bed), John\r\nHenry Menton (in bed), Bernard Corrigan (in bed), Patsy Dignam (in bed),\r\nPaddy Dignam (in the grave).\r\n\r\nAlone, what did Bloom hear?\r\n\r\nThe double reverberation of retreating feet on the heavenborn earth, the\r\ndouble vibration of a jew\xe2\x80\x99s harp in the resonant lane.\r\n\r\nAlone, what did Bloom feel?\r\n\r\nThe cold of interstellar space, thousands of degrees below freezing\r\npoint or the absolute zero of Fahrenheit, Centigrade or R\xc3\xa9aumur: the\r\nincipient intimations of proximate dawn.\r\n\r\nOf what did bellchime and handtouch and footstep and lonechill remind\r\nhim?\r\n\r\nOf companions now in various manners in different places defunct: Percy\r\nApjohn (killed in action, Modder River), Philip Gilligan (phthisis,\r\nJervis Street hospital), Matthew F. Kane (accidental drowning, Dublin\r\nBay), Philip Moisel (pyemia, Heytesbury street), Michael Hart (phthisis,\r\nMater Misericordiae hospital), Patrick Dignam (apoplexy, Sandymount).\r\n\r\nWhat prospect of what phenomena inclined him to remain?\r\n\r\nThe disparition of three final stars, the diffusion of daybreak, the\r\napparition of a new solar disk.\r\n\r\nHad he ever been a spectator of those phenomena?\r\n\r\nOnce, in 1887, after a protracted performance of charades in the house\r\nof Luke Doyle, Kimmage, he had awaited with patience the apparition\r\nof the diurnal phenomenon, seated on a wall, his gaze turned in the\r\ndirection of Mizrach, the east.\r\n\r\nHe remembered the initial paraphenomena?\r\n\r\nMore active air, a matutinal distant cock, ecclesiastical clocks at\r\nvarious points, avine music, the isolated tread of an early wayfarer,\r\nthe visible diffusion of the light of an invisible luminous body, the\r\nfirst golden limb of the resurgent sun perceptible low on the horizon.\r\n\r\nDid he remain?\r\n\r\nWith deep inspiration he returned, retraversing the garden, reentering\r\nthe passage, reclosing the door. With brief suspiration he reassumed the\r\ncandle, reascended the stairs, reapproached the door of the front room,\r\nhallfloor, and reentered.\r\n\r\nWhat suddenly arrested his ingress?\r\n\r\nThe right temporal lobe of the hollow sphere of his cranium came into\r\ncontact with a solid timber angle where, an infinitesimal but sensible\r\nfraction of a second later, a painful sensation was located in\r\nconsequence of antecedent sensations transmitted and registered.\r\n\r\nDescribe the alterations effected in the disposition of the articles of\r\nfurniture.\r\n\r\nA sofa upholstered in prune plush had been translocated from opposite\r\nthe door to the ingleside near the compactly furled Union Jack (an\r\nalteration which he had frequently intended to execute): the blue and\r\nwhite checker inlaid majolicatopped table had been placed opposite the\r\ndoor in the place vacated by the prune plush sofa: the walnut sideboard\r\n(a projecting angle of which had momentarily arrested his ingress) had\r\nbeen moved from its position beside the door to a more advantageous but\r\nmore perilous position in front of the door: two chairs had been moved\r\nfrom right and left of the ingleside to the position originally occupied\r\nby the blue and white checker inlaid majolicatopped table.\r\n\r\nDescribe them.\r\n\r\nOne: a squat stuffed easychair, with stout arms extended and back\r\nslanted to the rere, which, repelled in recoil, had then upturned an\r\nirregular fringe of a rectangular rug and now displayed on its amply\r\nupholstered seat a centralised diffusing and diminishing discolouration.\r\nThe other: a slender splayfoot chair of glossy cane curves, placed\r\ndirectly opposite the former, its frame from top to seat and from seat\r\nto base being varnished dark brown, its seat being a bright circle of\r\nwhite plaited rush.\r\n\r\nWhat significances attached to these two chairs?\r\n\r\nSignificances of similitude, of posture, of symbolism, of circumstantial\r\nevidence, of testimonial supermanence.\r\n\r\nWhat occupied the position originally occupied by the sideboard?\r\n\r\nA vertical piano (Cadby) with exposed keyboard, its closed coffin\r\nsupporting a pair of long yellow ladies\xe2\x80\x99 gloves and an emerald ashtray\r\ncontaining four consumed matches, a partly consumed cigarette and two\r\ndiscoloured ends of cigarettes, its musicrest supporting the music in\r\nthe key of G natural for voice and piano of Love\xe2\x80\x99s Old Sweet Song\r\n(words by G. Clifton Bingham, composed by J. L. Molloy, sung by Madam\r\nAntoinette Sterling) open at the last page with the final indications ad\r\nlibitum, forte, pedal, animato, sustained pedal, ritirando, close.\r\n\r\nWith what sensations did Bloom contemplate in rotation these objects?\r\n\r\nWith strain, elevating a candlestick: with pain, feeling on his right\r\ntemple a contused tumescence: with attention, focussing his gaze on\r\na large dull passive and a slender bright active: with solicitation,\r\nbending and downturning the upturned rugfringe: with amusement,\r\nremembering Dr Malachi Mulligan\xe2\x80\x99s scheme of colour containing the\r\ngradation of green: with pleasure, repeating the words and antecedent\r\nact and perceiving through various channels of internal sensibility\r\nthe consequent and concomitant tepid pleasant diffusion of gradual\r\ndiscolouration.\r\n\r\nHis next proceeding?\r\n\r\nFrom an open box on the majolicatopped table he extracted a black\r\ndiminutive cone, one inch in height, placed it on its circular base on\r\na small tin plate, placed his candlestick on the right corner of the\r\nmantelpiece, produced from his waistcoat a folded page of prospectus\r\n(illustrated) entitled Agendath Netaim, unfolded the same, examined\r\nit superficially, rolled it into a thin cylinder, ignited it in the\r\ncandleflame, applied it when ignited to the apex of the cone till the\r\nlatter reached the stage of rutilance, placed the cylinder in the basin\r\nof the candlestick disposing its unconsumed part in such a manner as to\r\nfacilitate total combustion.\r\n\r\nWhat followed this operation?\r\n\r\nThe truncated conical crater summit of the diminutive volcano emitted a\r\nvertical and serpentine fume redolent of aromatic oriental incense.\r\n\r\nWhat homothetic objects, other than the candlestick, stood on the\r\nmantelpiece?\r\n\r\nA timepiece of striated Connemara marble, stopped at the hour of 4.46\r\na.m. on the 21 March 1896, matrimonial gift of Matthew Dillon: a dwarf\r\ntree of glacial arborescence under a transparent bellshade, matrimonial\r\ngift of Luke and Caroline Doyle: an embalmed owl, matrimonial gift of\r\nAlderman John Hooper.\r\n\r\nWhat interchanges of looks took place between these three objects and\r\nBloom?\r\n\r\nIn the mirror of the giltbordered pierglass the undecorated back of the\r\ndwarf tree regarded the upright back of the embalmed owl. Before\r\nthe mirror the matrimonial gift of Alderman John Hooper with a clear\r\nmelancholy wise bright motionless compassionate gaze regarded Bloom\r\nwhile Bloom with obscure tranquil profound motionless compassionated\r\ngaze regarded the matrimonial gift of Luke and Caroline Doyle.\r\n\r\nWhat composite asymmetrical image in the mirror then attracted his\r\nattention?\r\n\r\nThe image of a solitary (ipsorelative) mutable (aliorelative) man.\r\n\r\nWhy solitary (ipsorelative)?\r\n\r\n      Brothers and sisters had he none.\r\n      Yet that man\xe2\x80\x99s father was his grandfather\xe2\x80\x99s son.\r\n\r\nWhy mutable (aliorelative)?\r\n\r\nFrom infancy to maturity he had resembled his maternal procreatrix.\r\nFrom maturity to senility he would increasingly resemble his paternal\r\nprocreator.\r\n\r\nWhat final visual impression was communicated to him by the mirror?\r\n\r\nThe optical reflection of several inverted volumes improperly arranged\r\nand not in the order of their common letters with scintillating titles\r\non the two bookshelves opposite.\r\n\r\nCatalogue these books.\r\n\r\nThom\xe2\x80\x99s Dublin Post Office Directory, 1886.\r\n\r\nDenis Florence M\xe2\x80\x99Carthy\xe2\x80\x99s Poetical Works (copper beechleaf bookmark at\r\np. 5).\r\n\r\nShakespeare\xe2\x80\x99s Works (dark crimson morocco, goldtooled).\r\n\r\nThe Useful Ready Reckoner (brown cloth).\r\n\r\nThe Secret History of the Court of Charles II (red cloth, tooled\r\nbinding).\r\n\r\nThe Child\xe2\x80\x99s Guide (blue cloth).\r\n\r\nThe Beauties of Killarney (wrappers).\r\n\r\nWhen We Were Boys by William O\xe2\x80\x99Brien M.

A. Wren, 9 Bachelor\xe2\x80\x99s Walk.\r\n\r\nWhat caused him irritation in his sitting posture?\r\n\r\nInhibitory pressure of collar (size 17) and waistcoat (5 buttons), two\r\narticles of clothing superfluous in the costume of mature males and\r\ninelastic to alterations of mass by expansion.\r\n\r\nHow was the irritation allayed?\r\n\r\nHe removed his collar, with contained black necktie and collapsible\r\nstud, from his neck to a position on the left of the table. He\r\nunbuttoned successively in reversed direction waistcoat, trousers, shirt\r\nand vest along the medial line of irregular incrispated black hairs\r\nextending in triangular convergence from the pelvic basin over the\r\ncircumference of the abdomen and umbilicular fossicle along the medial\r\nline of nodes to the intersection of the sixth pectoral vertebrae,\r\nthence produced both ways at right angles and terminating in circles\r\ndescribed about two equidistant points, right and left, on the summits\r\nof the mammary prominences. He unbraced successively each of six minus\r\none braced trouser buttons, arranged in pairs, of which one incomplete.\r\n\r\nWhat involuntary actions followed?\r\n\r\nHe compressed between 2 fingers the flesh circumjacent to a cicatrice in\r\nthe left infracostal region below the diaphragm resulting from a sting\r\ninflicted 2 weeks and 3 days previously (23 May 1904) by a bee.\r\nHe scratched imprecisely with his right hand, though insensible of\r\nprurition, various points and surfaces of his partly exposed, wholly\r\nabluted skin. He inserted his left hand into the left lower pocket of\r\nhis waistcoat and extracted and replaced a silver coin (1 shilling),\r\nplaced there (presumably) on the occasion (17 October 1903) of the\r\ninterment of Mrs Emily Sinico, Sydney Parade.\r\n\r\nCompile the budget for 16 June 1904.\r\n\r\n     Debit\r\n                                        \xc2\xa3. s. d.\r\n     1 Pork kidney                      0\xe2\x80\x940\xe2\x80\x943\r\n     1 Copy Freeman\xe2\x80\x99s Journal           0\xe2\x80\x940\xe2\x80\x941\r\n     1 Bath and Gratification           0\xe2\x80\x941\xe2\x80\x946\r\n     Tramfare                           0\xe2\x80\x940\xe2\x80\x941\r\n     1 In Memoriam Patrick Dignam       0\xe2\x80\x945\xe2\x80\x940\r\n     2 Banbury cakes                    0\xe2\x80\x940\xe2\x80\x941\r\n     1 Lunch                            0\xe2\x80\x940\xe2\x80\x947\r\n     1 Renewal fee for book             0\xe2\x80\x941\xe2\x80\x940\r\n     1 Packet Notepaper and Envelopes   0\xe2\x80\x940\xe2\x80\x942\r\n     1 Dinner and Gratification         0\xe2\x80\x942\xe2\x80\x940\r\n     1 Postal Order and Stamp           0\xe2\x80\x942\xe2\x80\x948\r\n     Tramfare                           0\xe2\x80\x940\xe2\x80\x941\r\n     1 Pig\xe2\x80\x99s Foot                       0\xe2\x80\x940\xe2\x80\x944\r\n     1 Sheep\xe2\x80\x99s Trotter                  0\xe2\x80\x940\xe2\x80\x943\r\n     1 Cake Fry\xe2\x80\x99s Plain Chocolate       0\xe2\x80\x940\xe2\x80\x941\r\n     1 Square Soda Bread                0\xe2\x80\x940\xe2\x80\x944\r\n     1 Coffee and Bun                   0\xe2\x80\x940\xe2\x80\x944\r\n     Loan (Stephen Dedalus) refunded    1\xe2\x80\x947\xe2\x80\x940\r\n        BALANCE                         0\xe2\x80\x9416\xe2\x80\x946\r\n                                        \xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\r\n                                        2\xe2\x80\x9419\xe2\x80\x943\r\n\r\n     Credit\r\n                                        \xc2\xa3. s. d.\r\n     Cash in hand                       0\xe2\x80\x944\xe2\x80\x949\r\n     Commission recd.

a benignant persistent ache in his footsoles he extended\r\nhis foot to one side and observed the creases, protuberances and salient\r\npoints caused by foot pressure in the course of walking repeatedly in\r\nseveral different directions, then, inclined, he disnoded the laceknots,\r\nunhooked and loosened the laces, took off each of his two boots for the\r\nsecond time, detached the partially moistened right sock through the\r\nfore part of which the nail of his great toe had again effracted, raised\r\nhis right foot and, having unhooked a purple elastic sock suspender,\r\ntook off his right sock, placed his unclothed right foot on the margin\r\nof the seat of his chair, picked at and gently lacerated the protruding\r\npart of the great toenail, raised the part lacerated to his nostrils and\r\ninhaled the odour of the quick, then, with satisfaction, threw away the\r\nlacerated ungual fragment.\r\n\r\nWhy with satisfaction?\r\n\r\nBecause the odour inhaled corresponded to other odours inhaled of other\r\nungual fragments, picked and lacerated by Master Bloom, pupil of Mrs\r\nEllis\xe2\x80\x99s juvenile school, patiently each night in the act of brief\r\ngenuflection and nocturnal prayer and ambitious meditation.\r\n\r\nIn what ultimate ambition had all concurrent and consecutive ambitions\r\nnow coalesced?\r\n\r\nNot to inherit by right of primogeniture, gavelkind or borough English,\r\nor possess in perpetuity an extensive demesne of a sufficient number\r\nof acres, roods and perches, statute land measure (valuation \xc2\xa3 42), of\r\ngrazing

Loyal to\r\nthe highest constituted power in the land, actuated by an innate love of\r\nrectitude his aims would be the strict maintenance of public order,\r\nthe repression of many abuses though not of all simultaneously (every\r\nmeasure of reform or retrenchment being a preliminary solution to be\r\ncontained by fluxion in the final solution), the upholding of the letter\r\nof the law (common, statute and law merchant) against all traversers in\r\ncovin and trespassers acting in contravention of bylaws and regulations,\r\nall resuscitators (by trespass and petty larceny of kindlings) of\r\nvenville rights, obsolete by desuetude, all orotund instigators\r\nof international persecution, all perpetuators of international\r\nanimosities, all menial molestors of domestic conviviality, all\r\nrecalcitrant violators of domestic connubiality.\r\n\r\nProve that he had loved rectitude from his earliest youth.\r\n\r\nTo Master Percy Apjohn at High School in 1880 he had divulged his\r\ndisbelief in the tenets of the Irish (protestant) church (to which his\r\nfather Rudolf Virag (later Rudolph Bloom) had been converted from the\r\nIsraelitic faith and communion in 1865 by the Society for promoting\r\nChristianity among the jews) subsequently abjured by him in favour of\r\nRoman catholicism at the epoch of and with a view to his matrimony\r\nin 1888. To Daniel Magrane and Francis Wade in 1882 during a juvenile\r\nfriendship (terminated by the premature emigration of the former) he\r\nhad advocated during nocturnal perambulations the political theory of\r\ncolonial (e.g. Canadian) expansion and the evolutionary theories of\r\nCharles Darwin, expounded in The Descent of Man and The Origin of\r\nSpecies. In 1885 he had publicly expressed his adherence to the\r\ncollective and national economic programme advocated by James Fintan\r\nLalor, John Fisher Murray, John Mitchel, J. F. X.

Nadir of\r\nmisery: the aged impotent disfranchised ratesupported moribund lunatic\r\npauper.\r\n\r\nWith which attendant indignities?\r\n\r\nThe unsympathetic indifference of previously amiable females, the\r\ncontempt of muscular males, the acceptance of fragments of bread,\r\nthe simulated ignorance of casual acquaintances, the latration of\r\nillegitimate unlicensed vagabond dogs, the infantile discharge of\r\ndecomposed vegetable missiles, worth little or nothing, nothing or less\r\nthan nothing.\r\n\r\nBy what could such a situation be precluded?\r\n\r\nBy decease (change of state): by departure (change of place).\r\n\r\nWhich preferably?\r\n\r\nThe latter, by the line of least resistance.\r\n\r\nWhat considerations rendered departure not entirely undesirable?\r\n\r\nConstant cohabitation impeding mutual toleration of personal defects.\r\nThe habit of independent purchase increasingly cultivated. The necessity\r\nto counteract by impermanent sojourn the permanence of arrest.\r\n\r\nWhat considerations rendered departure not irrational?\r\n\r\nThe parties concerned, uniting, had increased and multiplied, which\r\nbeing done, offspring produced and educed to maturity, the parties, if\r\nnot disunited were obliged to reunite for increase and multiplication,\r\nwhich was absurd, to form by reunion the original couple of uniting\r\nparties, which was impossible.\r\n\r\nWhat considerations rendered departure desirable?\r\n\r\nThe attractive character of certain localities in Ireland and abroad,\r\nas represented in general geographical maps of polychrome design or\r\nin special ordnance survey charts by employment of scale numerals and\r\nhachures.\r\n\r\nIn Ireland?\r\n\r\nThe cliffs of Moher, the windy wilds of Connemara, lough Neagh with\r\nsubmerged petrified city, the Giant\xe2\x80\x99s Causeway, Fort Camden and Fort\r\nCarlisle, the Golden Vale of Tipperary, the islands of Aran, the\r\npastures of royal Meath, Brigid\xe2\x80\x99s elm in Kildare, the Queen\xe2\x80\x99s Island\r\nshipyard in Belfast, the Salmon Leap, the lakes of Killarney.\r\n\r\nAbroad?\r\n\r\nCeylon (with spicegardens supplying tea to Thomas Kernan, agent for\r\nPulbrook, Robertson and Co, 2 Mincing Lane, London, E. C., 5 Dame\r\nstreet, Dublin), Jerusalem, the holy city (with mosque of Omar and gate\r\nof Damascus, goal of aspiration), the straits of Gibraltar (the unique\r\nbirthplace of Marion Tweedy), the Parthenon (containing statues of nude\r\nGrecian divinities), the Wall street money market (which controlled\r\ninternational finance), the Plaza de Toros at La Linea, Spain (where\r\nO\xe2\x80\x99Hara of the Camerons had slain the bull), Niagara (over which no human\r\nbeing had passed with impunity), the land of the Eskimos (eaters\r\nof soap), the forbidden country of Thibet (from which no traveller\r\nreturns), the bay of Naples (to see which was to die), the Dead Sea.\r\n\r\nUnder what guidance, following what signs?\r\n\r\nAt sea, septentrional, by night the polestar, located at the point of\r\nintersection of the right line from beta to alpha in Ursa Maior produced\r\nand divided externally at omega and the hypotenuse of the rightangled\r\ntriangle formed by the line alpha omega so produced and the line alpha\r\ndelta of Ursa Maior. On land, meridional, a bispherical moon, revealed\r\nin imperfect varying phases of lunation through the posterior interstice\r\nof the imperfectly occluded skirt of a carnose negligent perambulating\r\nfemale, a pillar of the cloud by day.\r\n\r\nWhat public advertisement would divulge the occultation of the departed?\r\n\r\n\xc2\xa3 5 reward, lost, stolen or strayed from his residence 7 Eccles street,\r\nmissing gent about 40, answering to the name of Bloom, Leopold (Poldy),\r\nheight 5 ft 9 1/2 inches, full build, olive complexion, may have since\r\ngrown a beard, when last seen was wearing a black suit. Above sum will\r\nbe paid for information leading to his discovery.\r\n\r\nWhat universal binomial denominations would be his as entity and\r\nnonentity?\r\n\r\nAssumed by any or known to none. Everyman or Noman.\r\n\r\nWhat tributes his?\r\n\r\nHonour and gifts of strangers, the friends of Everyman. A nymph\r\nimmortal, beauty, the bride of Noman.\r\n\r\nWould the departed never nowhere nohow reappear?\r\n\r\nEver he would wander, selfcompelled, to the extreme limit of his\r\ncometary orbit, beyond the fixed stars and variable suns and telescopic\r\nplanets, astronomical waifs and strays, to the extreme boundary of\r\nspace, passing from land to land, among peoples, amid events. Somewhere\r\nimperceptibly he would hear and somehow reluctantly, suncompelled, obey\r\nthe summons of recall. Whence, disappearing from the constellation of\r\nthe Northern Crown he would somehow reappear reborn above delta in the\r\nconstellation of Cassiopeia and after incalculable eons of peregrination\r\nreturn an estranged avenger, a wreaker of justice on malefactors, a dark\r\ncrusader, a sleeper awakened, with financial resources (by supposition)\r\nsurpassing those of Rothschild or the silver king.\r\n\r\nWhat would render such return irrational?\r\n\r\nAn unsatisfactory equation between an exodus and return in time through\r\nreversible space and an exodus and return in space through irreversible\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nWhat play of forces, inducing inertia, rendered departure undesirable?\r\n\r\nThe lateness of the hour, rendering procrastinatory: the obscurity\r\nof the night, rendering invisible: the uncertainty of thoroughfares,\r\nrendering perilous: the necessity for repose, obviating movement: the\r\nproximity of an occupied bed, obviating research: the anticipation of\r\nwarmth (human) tempered with coolness (linen), obviating desire and\r\nrendering desirable: the statue of Narcissus, sound without echo,\r\ndesired desire.\r\n\r\nWhat advantages were possessed by an occupied, as distinct from an\r\nunoccupied bed?\r\n\r\nThe removal of nocturnal solitude, the superior quality of human\r\n(mature female) to inhuman (hotwaterjar) calefaction, the stimulation of\r\nmatutinal contact, the economy of mangling done on the premises in the\r\ncase of trousers accurately folded and placed lengthwise between the\r\nspring mattress (striped) and the woollen mattress (biscuit section).\r\n\r\nWhat past consecutive causes, before rising preapprehended, of\r\naccumulated fatigue did Bloom, before rising, silently recapitulate?\r\n\r\nThe preparation of breakfast (burnt offering): intestinal congestion and\r\npremeditative defecation (holy of holies): the bath (rite of John): the\r\nfuneral (rite of Samuel): the advertisement of Alexander Keyes (Urim and\r\nThummim): the unsubstantial lunch (rite of Melchisedek): the visit to\r\nmuseum and national library (holy place): the bookhunt along Bedford\r\nrow, Merchants\xe2\x80\x99 Arch, Wellington Quay (Simchath Torah): the music in the\r\nOrmond Hotel (Shira Shirim): the altercation with a truculent troglodyte\r\nin Bernard Kiernan\xe2\x80\x99s premises (holocaust): a blank period of time\r\nincluding a cardrive, a visit to a house of mourning, a leavetaking\r\n(wilderness): the eroticism produced by feminine exhibitionism (rite of\r\nOnan): the prolonged delivery of Mrs Mina Purefoy (heave offering):\r\nthe visit to the disorderly house of Mrs Bella Cohen, 82 Tyrone\r\nstreet, lower, and subsequent brawl and chance medley in Beaver street\r\n(Armageddon): nocturnal perambulation to and from the cabman\xe2\x80\x99s shelter,\r\nButt Bridge (atonement).\r\n\r\nWhat selfimposed enigma did Bloom about to rise in order to go so as to\r\nconclude lest he should not conclude involuntarily apprehend?\r\n\r\nThe cause of a brief sharp unforeseen heard loud lone crack emitted by\r\nthe insentient material of a strainveined timber table.\r\n\r\nWhat selfinvolved enigma did Bloom risen, going, gathering multicoloured\r\nmultiform multitudinous garments, voluntarily apprehending, not\r\ncomprehend?\r\n\r\nWho was M\xe2\x80\x99Intosh?\r\n\r\nWhat selfevident enigma pondered with desultory constancy during 30\r\nyears did Bloom now, having effected natural obscurity by the extinction\r\nof artificial light, silently suddenly comprehend?\r\n\r\nWhere was Moses when the candle went out?\r\n\r\nWhat imperfections in a perfect day did Bloom, walking, charged with\r\ncollected articles of recently disvested male wearing apparel, silently,\r\nsuccessively, enumerate?\r\n\r\nA provisional failure to obtain renewal of an advertisement: to obtain\r\na certain quantity of tea from Thomas Kernan (agent for Pulbrook,\r\nRobertson and Co, 5 Dame Street, Dublin, and 2 Mincing Lane, London E.\r\nC.): to certify the presence or absence of posterior rectal orifice in\r\nthe case of Hellenic female divinities: to obtain admission (gratuitous\r\nor paid) to the performance of Leah by Mrs Bandmann Palmer at the Gaiety\r\nTheatre, 46, 47, 48, 49 South King street.\r\n\r\nWhat impression of an absent face did Bloom, arrested, silently recall?\r\n\r\nThe face of her father, the late Major Brian Cooper Tweedy, Royal Dublin\r\nFusiliers, of Gibraltar and Rehoboth, Dolphin\xe2\x80\x99s Barn.\r\n\r\nWhat recurrent impressions of the same were possible by hypothesis?\r\n\r\nRetreating, at the terminus of the Great Northern Railway, Amiens\r\nstreet, with constant uniform acceleration, along parallel lines\r\nmeeting at infinity, if produced: along parallel lines, reproduced from\r\ninfinity, with constant uniform retardation, at the terminus of the\r\nGreat Northern Railway, Amiens street, returning.\r\n\r\nWhat miscellaneous effects of female personal wearing apparel were\r\nperceived by him?\r\n\r\nA pair of new inodorous halfsilk black ladies\xe2\x80\x99 hose, a pair of new\r\nviolet garters, a pair of outsize ladies\xe2\x80\x99 drawers of India mull, cut on\r\ngenerous lines, redolent of opoponax, jessamine and Muratti\xe2\x80\x99s Turkish\r\ncigarettes and containing a long bright steel safety pin, folded\r\ncurvilinear, a camisole of batiste with thin lace border, an accordion\r\nunderskirt of blue silk moirette, all these objects being disposed\r\nirregularly on the top of a rectangular trunk, quadruple battened,\r\nhaving capped corners, with multicoloured labels, initialled on its fore\r\nside in white lettering B. C. T. (Brian Cooper Tweedy).\r\n\r\nWhat impersonal objects were perceived?\r\n\r\nA commode, one leg fractured, totally covered by square cretonne\r\ncutting, apple design, on which rested a lady\xe2\x80\x99s black straw hat.\r\nOrangekeyed ware, bought of Henry Price, basket, fancy goods, chinaware\r\nand ironmongery manufacturer, 21, 22, 23 Moore street, disposed\r\nirregularly on the washstand and floor and consisting of basin, soapdish\r\nand brushtray (on the washstand, together), pitcher and night article\r\n(on the floor, separate).\r\n\r\nBloom\xe2\x80\x99s acts?\r\n\r\nHe deposited the articles of clothing on a chair, removed his remaining\r\narticles of clothing, took from beneath the bolster at the head of the\r\nbed a folded long white nightshirt, inserted his head and arms into the\r\nproper apertures of the nightshirt, removed a pillow from the head to\r\nthe foot of the bed, prepared the bedlinen accordingly and entered the\r\nbed.\r\n\r\nHow?\r\n\r\nWith circumspection, as invariably when entering an abode (his own or\r\nnot his own): with solicitude, the snakespiral springs of the mattress\r\nbeing old, the brass quoits and pendent viper radii loose and tremulous\r\nunder stress and strain: prudently, as entering a lair or ambush of\r\nlust or adders: lightly, the less to disturb: reverently, the bed of\r\nconception and of birth, of consummation of marriage and of breach of\r\nmarriage, of sleep and of death.\r\n\r\nWhat did his limbs, when gradually extended, encounter?\r\n\r\nNew clean bedlinen, additional odours, the presence of a human form,\r\nfemale, hers, the imprint of a human form, male, not his, some crumbs,\r\nsome flakes of potted meat, recooked, which he removed.\r\n\r\nIf he had smiled why would he have smiled?\r\n\r\nTo reflect that each one who enters imagines himself to be the first to\r\nenter whereas he is always the last term of a preceding series even if\r\nthe first term of a succeeding one, each imagining himself to be first,\r\nlast, only and alone whereas he is neither first nor last nor only nor\r\nalone in a series originating in and repeated to infinity.\r\n\r\nWhat preceding series?\r\n\r\nAssuming Mulvey to be the first term of his series, Penrose, Bartell\r\nd\xe2\x80\x99Arcy, professor Goodwin, Julius Mastiansky, John Henry Menton, Father\r\nBernard Corrigan, a farmer at the Royal Dublin Society\xe2\x80\x99s Horse Show,\r\nMaggot O\xe2\x80\x99Reilly, Matthew Dillon, Valentine Blake Dillon (Lord Mayor\r\nof Dublin), Christopher Callinan, Lenehan, an Italian organgrinder,\r\nan unknown gentleman in the Gaiety Theatre, Benjamin Dollard, Simon\r\nDedalus, Andrew (Pisser) Burke, Joseph Cuffe, Wisdom Hely, Alderman John\r\nHooper, Dr Francis Brady, Father Sebastian of Mount Argus, a bootblack\r\nat the General Post Office, Hugh E. (Blazes) Boylan and so each and so\r\non to no last term.\r\n\r\nWhat were his reflections concerning the last member of this series and\r\nlate occupant of the bed?\r\n\r\nReflections on his vigour (a bounder), corporal proportion (a\r\nbillsticker), commercial ability (a bester), impressionability (a\r\nboaster).\r\n\r\nWhy for the observer impressionability in addition to vigour, corporal\r\nproportion and commercial ability?\r\n\r\nBecause he had observed with augmenting frequency in the preceding\r\nmembers of the same series the same concupiscence, inflammably\r\ntransmitted, first with alarm, then with understanding, then with\r\ndesire, finally with fatigue, with alternating symptoms of epicene\r\ncomprehension and apprehension.\r\n\r\nWith what antagonistic sentiments were his subsequent reflections\r\naffected?\r\n\r\nEnvy, jealousy, abnegation, equanimity.\r\n\r\nEnvy?\r\n\r\nOf a bodily and mental male organism specially adapted for the\r\nsuperincumbent posture of energetic human copulation and energetic\r\npiston and cylinder movement necessary for the complete satisfaction of\r\na constant but not acute concupiscence resident in a bodily and mental\r\nfemale organism, passive but not obtuse.\r\n\r\nJealousy?\r\n\r\nBecause a nature full and volatile in its free state, was alternately\r\nthe agent and reagent of attraction. Because attraction between agent(s)\r\nand reagent(s) at all instants varied, with inverse proportion of\r\nincrease and decrease, with incessant circular extension and radial\r\nreentrance. Because the controlled contemplation of the fluctuation of\r\nattraction produced, if desired, a fluctuation of pleasure.\r\n\r\nAbnegation?\r\n\r\nIn virtue of a) acquaintance initiated in September 1903 in the\r\nestablishment of George Mesias, merchant tailor and outfitter, 5 Eden\r\nQuay, b) hospitality extended and received in kind, reciprocated and\r\nreappropriated in person, c) comparative youth subject to impulses of\r\nambition and magnanimity, colleagual altruism and amorous egoism, d)\r\nextraracial attraction, intraracial inhibition, supraracial prerogative,\r\ne) an imminent provincial musical tour, common current expenses, net\r\nproceeds divided.\r\n\r\nEquanimity?\r\n\r\nAs as natural as any and every natural act of a nature expressed or\r\nunderstood executed in natured nature by natural creatures in accordance\r\nwith his, her and their natured natures, of dissimilar similarity.\r\nAs not so calamitous as a cataclysmic annihilation of the planet in\r\nconsequence of a collision with a dark sun. As less reprehensible than\r\ntheft, highway robbery, cruelty to children and animals, obtaining money\r\nunder false pretences, forgery, embezzlement, misappropriation of public\r\nmoney, betrayal of public trust, malingering, mayhem, corruption of\r\nminors, criminal libel, blackmail, contempt of court, arson, treason,\r\nfelony, mutiny on the high seas, trespass, burglary, jailbreaking,\r\npractice of unnatural vice, desertion from armed forces in the field,\r\nperjury, poaching, usury, intelligence with the king\xe2\x80\x99s enemies,\r\nimpersonation, criminal assault, manslaughter, wilful and premeditated\r\nmurder. As not more abnormal than all other parallel processes of\r\nadaptation to altered conditions of existence, resulting in a reciprocal\r\nequilibrium between the bodily organism and its attendant circumstances,\r\nfoods, beverages, acquired habits, indulged inclinations, significant\r\ndisease. As more than inevitable, irreparable.\r\n\r\nWhy more abnegation than jealousy, less envy than equanimity?\r\n\r\nFrom outrage (matrimony) to outrage (adultery) there arose nought but\r\noutrage (copulation) yet the matrimonial violator of the matrimonially\r\nviolated had not been outraged by the adulterous violator of the\r\nadulterously violated.\r\n\r\nWhat retribution, if any?\r\n\r\nAssassination, never, as two wrongs did not make one right. Duel by\r\ncombat, no. Divorce, not now. Exposure by mechanical artifice (automatic\r\nbed) or individual testimony (concealed ocular witnesses), not yet. Suit\r\nfor damages by legal influence or simulation of assault with evidence of\r\ninjuries sustained (selfinflicted), not impossibly. Hushmoney by moral\r\ninfluence, possibly. If any, positively, connivance, introduction of\r\nemulation (material, a prosperous rival agency of publicity: moral,\r\na successful rival agent of intimacy), depreciation, alienation,\r\nhumiliation, separation protecting the one separated from the other,\r\nprotecting the separator from both.\r\n\r\nBy what reflections did he, a conscious reactor against the void of\r\nincertitude, justify to himself his sentiments?\r\n\r\nThe preordained frangibility of the hymen: the presupposed intangibility\r\nof the thing in itself: the incongruity and disproportion between\r\nthe selfprolonging tension of the thing proposed to be done and the\r\nselfabbreviating relaxation of the thing done: the fallaciously inferred\r\ndebility of the female: the muscularity of the male: the variations of\r\nethical codes: the natural grammatical transition by inversion involving\r\nno alteration of sense of an aorist preterite proposition (parsed as\r\nmasculine subject, monosyllabic onomatopoeic transitive verb with direct\r\nfeminine object) from the active voice into its correlative aorist\r\npreterite proposition (parsed as feminine subject, auxiliary verb\r\nand quasimonosyllabic onomatopoeic past participle with complementary\r\nmasculine agent) in the passive voice: the continued product of\r\nseminators by generation: the continual production of semen by\r\ndistillation: the futility of triumph or protest or vindication: the\r\ninanity of extolled virtue: the lethargy of nescient matter: the apathy\r\nof the stars.\r\n\r\nIn what final satisfaction did these antagonistic sentiments and\r\nreflections, reduced to their simplest forms, converge?\r\n\r\nSatisfaction at the ubiquity in eastern and western terrestrial\r\nhemispheres, in all habitable lands and islands explored or unexplored\r\n(the land of the midnight sun, the islands of the blessed, the isles of\r\nGreece, the land of promise), of adipose anterior and posterior female\r\nhemispheres, redolent of milk and honey and of excretory sanguine and\r\nseminal warmth, reminiscent of secular families of curves of amplitude,\r\ninsusceptible of moods of impression or of contrarieties of expression,\r\nexpressive of mute immutable mature animality.\r\n\r\nThe visible signs of antesatisfaction?\r\n\r\nAn approximate erection: a solicitous adversion: a gradual elevation: a\r\ntentative revelation: a silent contemplation.\r\n\r\nThen?\r\n\r\nHe kissed the plump mellow yellow smellow melons of her rump, on each\r\nplump melonous hemisphere, in their mellow yellow furrow, with obscure\r\nprolonged provocative melonsmellonous osculation.\r\n\r\nThe visible signs of postsatisfaction?\r\n\r\nA silent contemplation: a tentative velation: a gradual abasement: a\r\nsolicitous aversion: a proximate erection.\r\n\r\nWhat followed this silent action?\r\n\r\nSomnolent invocation, less somnolent recognition, incipient excitation,\r\ncatechetical interrogation.\r\n\r\nWith what modifications did the narrator reply to this interrogation?\r\n\r\nNegative: he omitted to mention the clandestine correspondence between\r\nMartha Clifford and Henry Flower, the public altercation at, in and\r\nin the vicinity of the licensed premises of Bernard Kiernan and Co,\r\nLimited, 8, 9 and 10 Little Britain street, the erotic provocation\r\nand response thereto caused by the exhibitionism of Gertrude (Gerty),\r\nsurname unknown. Positive: he included mention of a performance by Mrs\r\nBandmann Palmer of Leah at the Gaiety Theatre, 46, 47, 48, 49 South King\r\nstreet, an invitation to supper at Wynn\xe2\x80\x99s (Murphy\xe2\x80\x99s) Hotel, 35, 36 and\r\n37 Lower Abbey street, a volume of peccaminous pornographical tendency\r\nentituled Sweets of Sin, anonymous author a gentleman of fashion, a\r\ntemporary concussion caused by a falsely calculated movement in the\r\ncourse of a postcenal gymnastic display, the victim (since completely\r\nrecovered) being Stephen Dedalus, professor and author, eldest surviving\r\nson of Simon Dedalus, of no fixed occupation, an aeronautical feat\r\nexecuted by him (narrator) in the presence of a witness, the professor\r\nand author aforesaid, with promptitude of decision and gymnastic\r\nflexibility.\r\n\r\nWas the narration otherwise unaltered by modifications?\r\n\r\nAbsolutely.\r\n\r\nWhich event or person emerged as the salient point of his narration?\r\n\r\nStephen Dedalus, professor and author.\r\n\r\nWhat limitations of activity and inhibitions of conjugal rights were\r\nperceived by listener and narrator concerning themselves during the\r\ncourse of this intermittent and increasingly more laconic narration?\r\n\r\nBy the listener a limitation of fertility inasmuch as marriage had been\r\ncelebrated 1 calendar month after the 18th anniversary of her birth (8\r\nSeptember 1870), viz. 8 October, and consummated on the same date with\r\nfemale issue born 15 June 1889, having been anticipatorily consummated\r\non the 10 September of the same year and complete carnal intercourse,\r\nwith ejaculation of semen within the natural female organ, having last\r\ntaken place 5 weeks previous, viz. 27 November 1893, to the birth on 29\r\nDecember 1893 of second (and only male) issue, deceased 9 January 1894,\r\naged 11 days, there remained a period of 10 years, 5 months and 18 days\r\nduring which carnal intercourse had been incomplete, without ejaculation\r\nof semen within the natural female organ. By the narrator a limitation\r\nof activity, mental and corporal, inasmuch as complete mental\r\nintercourse between himself and the listener had not taken place since\r\nthe consummation of puberty, indicated by catamenic hemorrhage, of the\r\nfemale issue of narrator and listener, 15 September 1903, there remained\r\na period of 9 months and 1 day during which, in consequence of a\r\npreestablished natural comprehension in incomprehension between the\r\nconsummated females (listener and issue), complete corporal liberty of\r\naction had been circumscribed.\r\n\r\nHow?\r\n\r\nBy various reiterated feminine interrogation concerning the masculine\r\ndestination whither, the place where, the time at which, the duration\r\nfor which, the object with which in the case of temporary absences,\r\nprojected or effected.\r\n\r\nWhat moved visibly above the listener\xe2\x80\x99s and the narrator\xe2\x80\x99s invisible\r\nthoughts?\r\n\r\nThe upcast reflection of a lamp and shade, an inconstant series of\r\nconcentric circles of varying gradations of light and shadow.\r\n\r\nIn what directions did listener and narrator lie?\r\n\r\nListener, S. E. by E.: Narrator, N. W. by W.: on the 53rd parallel of\r\nlatitude, N., and 6th meridian of longitude, W.: at an angle of 45\xc2\xb0 to\r\nthe terrestrial equator.\r\n\r\nIn what state of rest or motion?\r\n\r\nAt rest relatively to themselves and to each other. In motion being each\r\nand both carried westward, forward and rereward respectively, by the\r\nproper perpetual motion of the earth through everchanging tracks of\r\nneverchanging space.\r\n\r\nIn what posture?\r\n\r\nListener: reclined semilaterally, left, left hand under head, right\r\nleg extended in a straight line and resting on left leg, flexed, in the\r\nattitude of Gea-Tellus, fulfilled, recumbent, big with seed. Narrator:\r\nreclined laterally, left, with right and left legs flexed, the index\r\nfinger and thumb of the right hand resting on the bridge of the nose, in\r\nthe attitude depicted in a snapshot photograph made by Percy Apjohn, the\r\nchildman weary, the manchild in the womb.\r\n\r\nWomb? Weary?\r\n\r\nHe rests. He has travelled.\r\n\r\nWith?\r\n\r\nSinbad the Sailor and Tinbad the Tailor and Jinbad the Jailer and\r\nWhinbad the Whaler and Ninbad the Nailer and Finbad the Failer and\r\nBinbad the Bailer and Pinbad the Pailer and Minbad the Mailer and Hinbad\r\nthe Hailer and Rinbad the Railer and Dinbad the Kailer and Vinbad the\r\nQuailer and Linbad the Yailer and Xinbad the Phthailer.\r\n\r\nWhen?\r\n\r\nGoing to dark bed there was a square round Sinbad the Sailor roc\xe2\x80\x99s auk\xe2\x80\x99s\r\negg in the night of the bed of all the auks of the rocs of Darkinbad the\r\nBrightdayler.\r\n\r\nWhere?\r\n\r\n\xe2\x80\xa2\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[ 18 ]\r\n\r\nYes because he never did a thing like that before as ask to get his\r\nbreakfast in bed with a couple of eggs since the City Arms hotel when he\r\nused to be pretending to be laid up with a sick voice doing his highness\r\nto make himself interesting for that old faggot Mrs Riordan that he\r\nthought he had a great leg of and she never left us a farthing all for\r\nmasses for herself and her soul greatest miser ever was actually afraid\r\nto lay out 4d for her methylated spirit telling me all her ailments she\r\nhad too much old chat in her about politics and earthquakes and the end\r\nof the world let us have a bit of fun first God help the world if all\r\nthe women were her sort down on

at\r\nthe choir party at the sugarloaf Mountain the day I wore that dress\r\nMiss Stack bringing him flowers the worst old ones she could find at the\r\nbottom of the basket anything at all to get into a mans bedroom with\r\nher old maids voice trying to imagine he was dying on account of her to\r\nnever see thy face again though he looked more like a man with his beard\r\na bit grown in the bed father was the same besides I hate bandaging and\r\ndosing when he cut his toe with the razor paring his corns afraid hed\r\nget bloodpoisoning but if it was a thing I was sick then wed see

slinked\r\nout looking quite conscious what harm but he had the impudence to make\r\nup to me one time well done to him mouth almighty and his boiled eyes of\r\nall the big stupoes I ever met and thats called a solicitor only for\r\nI hate having a long wrangle in bed or else if its not that its some\r\nlittle bitch or other he got in with somewhere or picked up on the\r\nsly if they only knew him as well as I do yes because the day before\r\nyesterday he was scribbling something a letter when I came into the\r\nfront room to show him Dignams death in the paper as if something told\r\nme and he covered it up with the blottingpaper pretending to be thinking\r\nabout business so very probably that was it to somebody who thinks\r\nshe has a softy in him because all men get a bit like that at his age\r\nespecially getting on to forty he is now so as to wheedle any money she\r\ncan out of him no fool like an old fool and then the usual kissing my\r\nbottom was to hide it not that I care two straws now who he does it with\r\nor knew before that way though Id like to find out so long as I dont\r\nhave the two of them under my nose all the time like that slut that Mary\r\nwe had in Ontario terrace padding out her false bottom to excite him bad\r\nenough to get the smell of those painted women off him once or twice\r\nI had a suspicion by getting him to come near me when I found the\r\nlong hair on his coat without that one when I went into the kitchen\r\npretending he was drinking water 1 woman is not enough for them it was\r\nall his fault of course ruining servants then proposing that she could\r\neat at our table on Christmas day if you please O no thank you not in my\r\nhouse stealing my potatoes and the oysters 2/6 per doz going out to see\r\nher aunt if you please common robbery so it was but I was sure he had\r\nsomething on with that one it takes me to find out a thing like that he\r\nsaid you have no proof it was her proof O yes her aunt was very fond of\r\noysters but I told her what I thought of her suggesting me to go out to\r\nbe alone with her I wouldnt lower myself to spy on them the garters I\r\nfound in her room the Friday she was out that was enough for me a little\r\nbit too much her face swelled up on her with temper when I gave her her\r\nweeks notice I saw to that better do without them altogether do out the\r\nrooms myself quicker only for the damn cooking and throwing out the dirt\r\nI gave it to him anyhow either she or me leaves the house I couldnt even\r\ntouch him if I thought he was with a dirty barefaced liar and sloven\r\nlike that one denying it up to my face and singing about the place in\r\nthe W C too because she knew she was too well off yes because he couldnt\r\npossibly do without it that long so he must do it somewhere and the last\r\ntime he came on my bottom when was it the night Boylan gave my hand a\r\ngreat squeeze going along by the Tolka in my hand there steals another\r\nI just pressed the back of his like that with my thumb to squeeze back\r\nsinging the young May moon shes beaming love because he has an idea\r\nabout him and me hes not such a fool he said Im dining out and going to\r\nthe Gaiety though Im not going to give him the satisfaction in any case\r\nGod knows hes a change in a way not to be always and ever wearing the\r\nsame old hat unless I paid some nicelooking boy to do it since I cant do\r\nit myself a young boy would like me Id confuse him a little alone with\r\nhim if we were Id let him see my garters the new ones and make him turn\r\nred looking at him seduce him I know what boys feel with that down\r\non their cheek doing that frigging drawing out the thing by the hour\r\nquestion and answer would you do this that and the other with the\r\ncoalman yes with a bishop yes I would because I told him about some dean\r\nor bishop was sitting beside me in the jews temples gardens when I was\r\nknitting that woollen thing a stranger to Dublin what place was it and\r\nso on about the monuments and he tired me out with statues encouraging\r\nhim making him worse than he is who is in your mind now tell me who are\r\nyou thinking of who is it tell me his name who tell me who the german\r\nEmperor is it yes imagine Im him think of him can you feel him trying to\r\nmake a whore of me what he never will he ought to give it up now at this\r\nage of his life simply ruination for any woman and no satisfaction in it\r\npretending to like it till he comes and then finish it off myself anyway\r\nand it makes your lips pale anyhow its done now once and for all with\r\nall the talk of the world about it people make its only the first time\r\nafter that its just the ordinary do it and think no more about it why\r\ncant you kiss a man without going and marrying him first you sometimes\r\nlove to wildly when you feel that way so nice all over you you cant help\r\nyourself I wish some man or other would take me sometime when hes there\r\nand kiss me in his arms theres nothing like a kiss long and hot down to\r\nyour soul almost paralyses you then I hate that confession when I used\r\nto go to Father Corrigan he touched me father and what harm if he did\r\nwhere and I said on the canal bank like a fool but whereabouts on your\r\nperson my child on the leg behind high up was it yes rather high up was\r\nit where you sit down yes O Lord couldnt he say bottom right out and\r\nhave done with it what has that got to do with it and did you whatever\r\nway he put it I forget no father and I always think of the real father\r\nwhat did he want to know for when I already confessed it to God he had\r\na nice fat hand the palm moist always I wouldnt mind feeling it neither\r\nwould he Id say by the bullneck in his horsecollar I wonder did he know\r\nme in the box I could see his face he couldnt see mine of course hed\r\nnever turn or let on still his eyes were red when his father died theyre\r\nlost for a woman of course must be terrible when a man cries let alone\r\nthem Id like to be embraced by one in his vestments and the smell of\r\nincense off him like the pope besides theres no danger with a priest if\r\nyoure married hes too careful about himself then give something to H\r\nH the pope for a penance I wonder was he satisfied with me one thing I\r\ndidnt like his slapping me behind going away so familiarly in the hall\r\nthough I laughed Im not a horse or an ass am I I suppose he was thinking\r\nof his fathers I wonder is he awake thinking of me or dreaming am I in\r\nit who gave him that flower he said he bought he smelt of some kind of\r\ndrink not whisky or stout or perhaps the sweety kind of paste they stick\r\ntheir bills up with some liqueur Id like to sip those richlooking green\r\nand yellow expensive drinks those stagedoor johnnies drink with the\r\nopera hats I tasted once with my finger dipped out of that American that\r\nhad the squirrel talking stamps with father he had all he could do to\r\nkeep himself from falling asleep after the last time after we took the\r\nport and potted meat it had a fine salty taste yes because I felt lovely\r\nand tired myself and fell asleep as sound as a top the moment I popped\r\nstraight into bed till that thunder woke me up God be merciful to us\r\nI thought the heavens were coming down about us to punish us when I\r\nblessed myself and said a Hail Mary like those awful thunderbolts in\r\nGibraltar as if the world was coming to an end and then they come and\r\ntell you theres no God what could you do if it was running and rushing\r\nabout nothing only make an act of contrition the candle I lit that\r\nevening in Whitefriars street chapel for the month of May see it brought\r\nits luck though hed scoff if he heard because he never goes to church\r\nmass or meeting he says your soul you have no soul inside only grey\r\nmatter because he doesnt know what it is to have one yes when I lit the\r\nlamp because he must have come 3 or 4 times with that tremendous big red\r\nbrute of a thing he has I thought the vein or whatever the dickens they\r\ncall it was going to burst though his nose is not so big after I took\r\noff all my things with the blinds down after my hours dressing and\r\nperfuming and combing it like iron or some kind of a thick crowbar\r\nstanding all the time he must have eaten oysters I think a few dozen he\r\nwas in great singing voice no I never in all my life felt anyone had\r\none the size of that to make you feel full up he must have eaten a whole\r\nsheep after whats the idea making us like that with a big hole in the\r\nmiddle of us or like a Stallion driving it up into you because thats all\r\nthey want out of you with that determined vicious look in his eye I had\r\nto halfshut my eyes still he hasnt such a tremendous amount of spunk in\r\nhim when I made him pull out and do it on me considering how big it is\r\nso much the better in case any of it wasnt washed out properly the last\r\ntime I let him finish it in me nice invention they made for women for\r\nhim to get all the pleasure but if someone gave them a touch of it\r\nthemselves theyd know what I went through with Milly nobody would\r\nbelieve cutting her teeth too and Mina Purefoys husband give us a swing\r\nout of your whiskers filling her up with a child or twins once a year\r\nas regular as the clock always with a smell of children off her the one\r\nthey called budgers or something like a nigger with a shock of hair on\r\nit Jesusjack the child is a black the last time I was there a squad of\r\nthem falling over one another and bawling you couldnt hear your ears\r\nsupposed to be healthy not satisfied till they have us swollen out like\r\nelephants or I dont know what supposing I risked having another not off\r\nhim though still if he was married Im sure hed have a fine strong child\r\nbut I dont know Poldy has more spunk in him yes thatd be awfully jolly\r\nI suppose it was meeting Josie Powell and the funeral and thinking about\r\nme and Boylan set him off well he can think what he likes now if thatll\r\ndo him any good I know they were spooning a bit when I came on the scene\r\nhe was dancing and sitting out with her the night of Georgina Simpsons\r\nhousewarming and then he wanted to ram it down my neck it was on account\r\nof not liking to see her a wallflower that was why we had the standup\r\nrow over politics he began it not me when he said about Our Lord being a\r\ncarpenter at last he made me cry of course a woman is so sensitive about\r\neverything I was fuming with myself after for giving in only for I knew\r\nhe was gone on me and the first socialist he said He was he annoyed me\r\nso much I couldnt put him into a temper still he knows a lot of mixedup\r\nthings especially about the body and the inside I often wanted to study\r\nup that myself what we have inside us in that family physician I could\r\nalways hear his voice talking when the room was crowded and watch him\r\nafter that I pretended I had a coolness on with her over him because he\r\nused to be a bit on the jealous side whenever he asked who are you going\r\nto and I said over to Floey and he made me the present of Byrons poems\r\nand the three pairs of gloves so that finished that I could quite easily\r\nget him to make it up any time I know how Id even supposing he got in\r\nwith her again and was going out to see her somewhere Id know if he\r\nrefused to eat the onions I know plenty of ways ask him to tuck down the\r\ncollar of my blouse or touch him with my veil and gloves on going out 1\r\nkiss then would send them all spinning however alright well see then let\r\nhim go to her she of course would only be too delighted to pretend shes\r\nmad in love with him that I wouldnt so much mind Id just go to her and\r\nask her do you love him and look her square in the eyes she couldnt fool\r\nme but he might imagine he was and make a declaration to her with his\r\nplabbery kind of a manner like he did to me though I had the devils own\r\njob to get it out of him though I liked him for that it showed he could\r\nhold in and wasnt to be got for the asking he was on the pop of asking\r\nme too the night in the kitchen I was rolling the potato cake theres\r\nsomething I want to say to you only for I put him off letting on I was\r\nin a temper with my hands and arms full of pasty flour in any case I let\r\nout too much the night before talking of dreams so I didnt want to let\r\nhim know more than was good for him she used to be always embracing me\r\nJosie whenever he was there meaning him of course glauming me over and\r\nwhen I said I washed up and down as far as possible asking me and did\r\nyou wash possible the women are always egging on to that putting it on\r\nthick when hes there they know by his sly eye blinking a bit putting on\r\nthe indifferent when they come out with something the kind he is what\r\nspoils him I dont wonder in the least because he was very handsome at\r\nthat time trying to look like Lord Byron I said I liked though he\r\nwas too beautiful for a man and he was a little before we got engaged\r\nafterwards though she didnt like it so much the day I was in fits of\r\nlaughing with the giggles I couldnt stop about all my hairpins falling\r\nout one after another with the mass of hair I had youre always in great\r\nhumour she said yes because it grigged her because she knew what it\r\nmeant because I used to tell her a good bit of what went on between us\r\nnot all but just enough to make her mouth water but that wasnt my fault\r\nshe didnt darken the door much after we were married I wonder what shes\r\ngot like now after living with that dotty husband of hers she had her\r\nface beginning to look drawn and run down the last time I saw her she\r\nmust have been just after a row with him because I saw on the moment she\r\nwas edging to draw down a conversation about husbands and talk about him\r\nto run him down what was it she told me O yes that sometimes he used to\r\ngo to bed with his muddy boots on when the maggot takes him just imagine\r\nhaving to get into bed with a thing like that that might murder you\r\nany moment what a man well its not the one way everyone goes mad Poldy\r\nanyhow whatever he does always wipes his feet on the mat when he comes\r\nin wet or shine and always blacks his own boots too and he always takes\r\noff his hat when he comes up in the street like then and now hes going\r\nabout in his slippers to look for \xc2\xa3 10000 for a postcard U p up O\r\nsweetheart May wouldnt a thing like that simply bore you stiff to\r\nextinction actually too stupid even to take his boots off now what\r\ncould you make of a man like that Id rather die 20 times over than marry\r\nanother of their sex of course hed never find another woman like me to\r\nput up with him the way I do know me come sleep with me yes and he knows\r\nthat too at the bottom of his heart take that Mrs Maybrick that poisoned\r\nher husband for what I wonder in love with some other man yes it was\r\nfound out on her wasnt she the downright villain to go and do a thing\r\nlike that of course some men can be dreadfully aggravating drive you mad\r\nand always the worst word in the world what do they ask us to marry them\r\nfor if were so bad as all that comes to yes because they cant get on\r\nwithout us white Arsenic she put in his tea off flypaper wasnt it I\r\nwonder why they call it that if I asked him hed say its from the Greek\r\nleave us as wise as we were before she must have been madly in love with\r\nthe other fellow to run the chance of being hanged O she didnt care if\r\nthat was her nature what could she do besides theyre not brutes enough\r\nto go and hang a woman surely are they\r\n\r\ntheyre all so different Boylan talking about the shape of my foot he\r\nnoticed at once even before he was introduced when I was in the D B C\r\nwith Poldy laughing and trying to listen I was waggling my foot we both\r\nordered 2 teas and plain bread and butter I saw him looking with his\r\ntwo old maids of sisters when I stood up and asked the girl where it was\r\nwhat do I care with it dropping out of me and that black closed breeches\r\nhe made me buy takes you half an hour to let them down wetting all\r\nmyself always with some brandnew fad every other week such a long one I\r\ndid I forgot my suede gloves on the seat behind that I never got after\r\nsome robber of a woman and he wanted me to put it in the Irish times\r\nlost in the ladies lavatory D B C Dame street finder return to Mrs\r\nMarion Bloom and I saw his eyes on my feet going out through the turning\r\ndoor he was looking when I looked back and I went there for tea 2 days\r\nafter in the hope but he wasnt now how did that excite him because I was\r\ncrossing them when we were in the other room first he meant the shoes\r\nthat are too tight to walk in my hand is nice like that if I only had a\r\nring with the stone for my month a nice aquamarine Ill stick him for one\r\nand a gold bracelet I dont like my foot so much still I made him spend\r\nonce with my foot the night after Goodwins botchup of a concert so cold\r\nand windy it was well we had that rum in the house to mull and the fire\r\nwasnt black out when he asked to take off my stockings lying on the\r\nhearthrug in Lombard street west and another time it was my muddy boots\r\nhed like me to walk in all the horses dung I could find but of course\r\nhes not natural like the rest of the world that I what did he say I\r\ncould give 9 points in 10 to Katty Lanner and beat her what does that\r\nmean I asked him I forget what he said because the stoppress edition\r\njust passed and the man with the curly hair in the Lucan dairy thats so\r\npolite I think I saw his face before somewhere I noticed him when I was\r\ntasting the butter so I took my time Bartell DArcy too that he used to\r\nmake fun of when he commenced kissing me on the choir stairs after\r\nI sang Gounods Ave Maria what are we waiting for O my heart kiss me\r\nstraight on the brow and part which is my brown part he was pretty hot\r\nfor all his tinny voice too my low notes he was always raving about if\r\nyou can believe him I liked the way he used his mouth singing then he\r\nsaid wasnt it terrible to do that there in a place like that I dont see\r\nanything so terrible about it Ill tell him about that some day not now\r\nand surprise him ay and Ill take him there and show him the very place\r\ntoo we did it so now there you are like it or lump it he thinks nothing\r\ncan happen without him knowing he hadnt an idea about my mother till we\r\nwere engaged otherwise hed never have got me so cheap as he did he was\r\n10 times worse himself anyhow begging me to give him a tiny bit cut off\r\nmy drawers that was the evening coming along Kenilworth square he kissed\r\nme in the eye of my glove and I had to take it off asking me questions\r\nis it permitted to enquire the shape of my bedroom so I let him keep it\r\nas if I forgot it to think of me when I saw him slip it into his pocket\r\nof course hes mad on the subject of drawers thats plain to be seen\r\nalways skeezing at those brazenfaced things on the bicycles with their\r\nskirts blowing up to their navels even when Milly and I were out with\r\nhim at the open air fete that one in the cream muslin standing right\r\nagainst the sun so he could see every atom she had on when he saw me\r\nfrom behind following in the rain I saw him before he saw me however\r\nstanding at the corner of the Harolds cross road with a new raincoat on\r\nhim with the muffler in the Zingari colours to show off his complexion\r\nand the brown hat looking slyboots as usual what was he doing there\r\nwhere hed no business they can go and get whatever they like from\r\nanything at all with a skirt on it and were not to ask any questions but\r\nthey want to know where were you where are you going I could feel him\r\ncoming along skulking after me his eyes on my neck he had been keeping\r\naway from the house he felt it was getting too warm for him so I\r\nhalfturned and stopped then he pestered me to say yes till I took off my\r\nglove slowly watching him he said my openwork sleeves were too cold for\r\nthe rain anything for an excuse to put his hand anear me drawers drawers\r\nthe whole blessed time till I promised to give him the pair off my doll\r\nto carry about in his waistcoat pocket O Maria Santisima he did look\r\na big fool dreeping in the rain splendid set of teeth he had made me\r\nhungry to look at them and beseeched of me to lift the orange petticoat\r\nI had on with the sunray pleats that there was nobody he said hed kneel\r\ndown in the wet if I didnt so persevering he would too and ruin his new\r\nraincoat you never know what freak theyd take alone with you theyre so\r\nsavage for it if anyone was passing so I lifted them a bit and touched\r\nhis trousers outside the way I used to Gardner after with my ring hand\r\nto keep him from doing worse where it was too public I was dying to find\r\nout was he circumcised he was shaking like a jelly all over they want\r\nto do everything too quick take all the pleasure out of it and father\r\nwaiting all the time for his dinner he told me to say I left my purse in\r\nthe butchers and had to go back for it what a Deceiver then he wrote me\r\nthat letter with all those words in it how could he have the face to any\r\nwoman after his company manners making it so awkward after when we met\r\nasking me have I offended you with my eyelids down of course he saw I\r\nwasnt he had a few brains not like that other fool Henny Doyle he was\r\nalways breaking or tearing something in the charades I hate an unlucky\r\nman and if I knew what it meant of course I had to say no for form sake\r\ndont understand you I said and wasnt it natural so it is of course\r\nit used to be written up with a picture of a womans on that wall in\r\nGibraltar with that word I couldnt find anywhere only for children\r\nseeing it too young then writing every morning a letter sometimes twice\r\na day I liked the way he made love then he knew the way to take a woman\r\nwhen he sent me the 8 big poppies because mine was the 8th then I wrote\r\nthe night he kissed my heart at Dolphins barn I couldnt describe it\r\nsimply it makes you feel like nothing on earth but he never knew how to\r\nembrace well like Gardner I hope hell come on Monday as he said at the\r\nsame time four I hate people who come at all hours answer the door you\r\nthink its the vegetables then its somebody and you all undressed or\r\nthe door of the filthy sloppy kitchen blows open the day old frostyface\r\nGoodwin called about the concert in Lombard street and I just after\r\ndinner all flushed and tossed with boiling old stew dont look at me\r\nprofessor I had to say Im a fright yes but he was a real old gent in his\r\nway it was impossible to be more respectful nobody to say youre out you\r\nhave to peep out through the blind like the messengerboy today I thought\r\nit was a putoff first him sending the port and the peaches first and I\r\nwas just beginning to yawn with nerves thinking he was trying to make a\r\nfool of me when I knew his tattarrattat at the door he must have been\r\na bit late because it was 1/4 after 3 when I saw the 2 Dedalus girls\r\ncoming from school I never know the time even that watch he gave me\r\nnever seems to go properly Id want to get it looked after when I threw\r\nthe penny to that lame sailor for England home and beauty when I was\r\nwhistling there is a charming girl I love and I hadnt even put on my\r\nclean shift or powdered myself or a thing then this day week were to go\r\nto Belfast just as well he has to go to Ennis his fathers anniversary\r\nthe 27th it wouldnt be pleasant if he did suppose our rooms at the hotel\r\nwere beside each other and any fooling went on in the new bed I couldnt\r\ntell him to stop and not bother me with him in the next room or perhaps\r\nsome protestant clergyman with a cough knocking on the wall then hed\r\nnever believe the next day we didnt do something its all very well a\r\nhusband but you cant fool a lover after me telling him we never did\r\nanything of course he didnt believe me no its better hes going where\r\nhe is besides something always happens with him the time going to the\r\nMallow concert at Maryborough ordering boiling soup for the two of\r\nus then the bell rang out he walks down the platform with the soup\r\nsplashing about taking spoonfuls of it hadnt he the nerve and the waiter\r\nafter him making a holy show of us screeching and confusion for the\r\nengine to start but he wouldnt pay till he finished it the two gentlemen\r\nin the 3rd class carriage said he was quite right so he was too hes so\r\npigheaded sometimes when he gets a thing into his head a good job he was\r\nable to open the carriage door with his knife or theyd have taken us on\r\nto Cork I suppose that was done out of revenge on him O I love jaunting\r\nin a train or a car with lovely soft cushions I wonder will he take\r\na 1st class for me he might want to do it in the train by tipping the\r\nguard well O I suppose therell be the usual idiots of men gaping at\r\nus with their eyes as stupid as ever they can possibly be that was an\r\nexceptional man that common workman that left us alone in the carriage\r\nthat day going to Howth Id like to find out something about him 1 or 2\r\ntunnels perhaps then you have to look out of the window all the nicer\r\nthen coming back suppose I never came back what would they say eloped\r\nwith him that gets you on on the stage the last concert I sang at where\r\nits over a year ago when was it St Teresas hall Clarendon St little\r\nchits of missies they have now singing Kathleen Kearney and her like\r\non account of father being in the army and my singing the absentminded\r\nbeggar and wearing a brooch for Lord Roberts when I had the map of it\r\nall and Poldy not Irish enough was it him managed it this time I wouldnt\r\nput it past him like he got me on to sing in the Stabat Mater by going\r\naround saying he was putting Lead Kindly Light to music I put him up to\r\nthat till the jesuits found out he was a freemason thumping the piano\r\nlead Thou me on copied from some old opera yes and he was going about\r\nwith some of them Sinner Fein lately or whatever they call themselves\r\ntalking his usual trash and nonsense he says that little man he showed\r\nme without the neck is very intelligent the coming man Griffiths is he\r\nwell he doesnt look it thats all I can say still it must have been him\r\nhe knew there was a boycott I hate the mention of their politics after\r\nthe war that Pretoria and Ladysmith and Bloemfontein where Gardner lieut\r\nStanley G 8th Bn 2nd East Lancs Rgt of enteric fever he was a lovely\r\nfellow in khaki and just the right height over me Im sure he was brave\r\ntoo he said I was lovely the evening we kissed goodbye at the canal lock\r\nmy Irish beauty he was pale with excitement about going away or wed be\r\nseen from the road he couldnt stand properly and I so hot as I never\r\nfelt they could have made their peace in the beginning or old oom Paul\r\nand the rest of the other old Krugers go and fight it out between them\r\ninstead of dragging on for years killing any finelooking men there were\r\nwith their fever if he was even decently shot it wouldnt have been so\r\nbad I love to see a regiment pass in review the first time I saw the\r\nSpanish cavalry at La Roque it was lovely after looking across the bay\r\nfrom Algeciras all the lights of the rock like fireflies or those sham\r\nbattles on the 15 acres the Black Watch with their kilts in time at the\r\nmarch past the 10th hussars the prince of Wales own or the lancers O the\r\nlancers theyre grand or the Dublins that won Tugela his father made his\r\nmoney over selling the horses for the cavalry well he could buy me a\r\nnice present up in Belfast after what I gave him theyve lovely linen up\r\nthere or one of those nice kimono things I must buy a mothball like I\r\nhad before to keep in the drawer with them it would be exciting going\r\nround with him shopping buying those things in a new city better leave\r\nthis ring behind want to keep turning and turning to get it over the\r\nknuckle there or they might bell it round the town in their papers or\r\ntell the police on me but theyd think were married O let them all go and\r\nsmother themselves for the fat lot I care he has plenty of money and hes\r\nnot a marrying man so somebody better get it out of him if I could find\r\nout whether he likes me I looked a bit washy of course when I looked\r\nclose in the handglass powdering a mirror never gives you the expression\r\nbesides scrooching down on me like that all the time with his big\r\nhipbones hes heavy too with his hairy chest for this heat always having\r\nto lie down for them better for him put it into me from behind the way\r\nMrs Mastiansky told me her husband made her like the dogs do it and\r\nstick out her tongue as far as ever she could and he so quiet and mild\r\nwith his tingating cither can you ever be up to men the way it takes\r\nthem lovely stuff in that blue suit he had on and stylish tie and socks\r\nwith the skyblue silk things on them hes certainly welloff I know by the\r\ncut his clothes have and his heavy watch but he was like a perfect devil\r\nfor a few minutes after he came back with the stoppress tearing up the\r\ntickets and swearing blazes because he lost 20 quid he said he lost over\r\nthat outsider that won and half he put on for me on account of Lenehans\r\ntip cursing him to the lowest pits that sponger he was making free\r\nwith me after the Glencree dinner coming back that long joult over the\r\nfeatherbed mountain after the lord Mayor looking at me with his dirty\r\neyes Val Dillon that big heathen I first noticed him at dessert when I\r\nwas cracking the nuts with my teeth I wished I could have picked every\r\nmorsel of that chicken out of my fingers it was so tasty and browned\r\nand as tender as anything only for I didnt want to eat everything on my\r\nplate those forks and fishslicers were hallmarked silver too I wish I\r\nhad some I could easily have slipped a couple into my muff when I\r\nwas playing with them then always hanging out of them for money in a\r\nrestaurant for the bit you put down your throat we have to be thankful\r\nfor our mangy cup of tea itself as a great compliment to be noticed the\r\nway the world is divided in any case if its going to go on I want at\r\nleast two other good chemises for one thing and but I dont know what\r\nkind of drawers he likes none at all I think didnt he say yes and half\r\nthe girls in Gibraltar never wore them either naked as God made them\r\nthat Andalusian singing her Manola she didnt make much secret of what\r\nshe hadnt yes and the second pair of silkette stockings is laddered\r\nafter one days wear I could have brought them back to Lewers this\r\nmorning and kicked up a row and made that

elastic gores on the hips he saved the one I have\r\nbut thats no good what did they say they give a delightful figure line\r\n11/6 obviating that unsightly broad appearance across the lower back to\r\nreduce flesh my belly is a bit too big Ill have to knock off the\r\nstout at dinner or am I getting too fond of it the last they sent from\r\nORourkes was as flat as a pancake he makes his money easy Larry they\r\ncall him the old mangy parcel he sent at Xmas a cottage cake and a\r\nbottle of hogwash he tried to palm off as claret that he couldnt get\r\nanyone to drink God spare his spit for fear hed die of the drouth or\r\nI must do a few breathing exercises I wonder is that antifat any good\r\nmight overdo it the thin ones are not so much the fashion now garters\r\nthat much I have the violet pair I wore today thats all he bought me\r\nout of the cheque he got on the first O no there was the face lotion\r\nI finished the last of yesterday that made my skin like new I told him\r\nover and over again get that made up in the same place and dont forget\r\nit God only knows whether he did after all I said to him Ill know by\r\nthe bottle anyway if not I suppose Ill only

35\r\nno Im what am I at all Ill be 33 in September will I what O well look at\r\nthat Mrs Galbraith shes much older than me I saw her when I was out last\r\nweek her beautys on the wane she was a lovely woman magnificent head of\r\nhair on her down to her waist tossing it back like that like Kitty OShea\r\nin Grantham street 1st thing I did every morning to look across see her\r\ncombing it as if she loved it and was full of it pity I only got to\r\nknow her the day before we left and that Mrs Langtry the jersey lily the\r\nprince of Wales was in love with I suppose hes like the first man going\r\nthe roads only for the name of a king theyre all made the one way only a\r\nblack mans Id like to try a beauty up to what was she 45 there was some\r\nfunny story about the jealous old husband what was it at all and an\r\noyster knife he went no he made her wear a kind of a tin thing round her\r\nand the prince of Wales yes he had the oyster knife cant be true a thing\r\nlike that like some of those books he brings me the works of Master\r\nFrancois Somebody supposed to be a priest about a child born out of her\r\near because her bumgut fell out a nice word for any priest to write\r\nand her a\xe2\x80\x94e as if any fool wouldnt know what that meant I hate that\r\npretending of all things with that old blackguards face on him anybody\r\ncan see its not true and that Ruby and Fair Tyrants he brought me that\r\ntwice I remember when I came to page 50 the part about where she hangs\r\nhim up out of a hook with a cord flagellate sure theres nothing for a\r\nwoman in that all invention made up about he drinking the champagne out\r\nof her slipper after the ball was over like the infant Jesus in the\r\ncrib at Inchicore in the Blessed Virgins arms sure no woman could have\r\na child that big taken out of her and I thought first it came out of her\r\nside because how could she go to the chamber when she wanted to and she\r\na rich lady of course she felt honoured H R H he was in Gibraltar the\r\nyear I was born I bet he found lilies there too where he planted the\r\ntree he planted more than that in his time he might have planted me\r\ntoo if hed come a bit sooner then I wouldnt be here as I am he ought to\r\nchuck that Freeman with the paltry few shillings he knocks out of it and\r\ngo into an office or something where hed get regular pay or a bank where\r\nthey could put him up on a throne to count the money all the day of\r\ncourse he prefers plottering about the house so you cant stir with him\r\nany side whats your programme today I wish hed even smoke a pipe like\r\nfather to get the smell of a man or pretending to be mooching about for\r\nadvertisements when he could have been in Mr Cuffes still only for\r\nwhat he did then sending me to try and patch it up I could have got him\r\npromoted there to be the manager he gave me a great mirada once or twice\r\nfirst he was as stiff as the mischief really and truly Mrs Bloom only I\r\nfelt rotten simply with the old rubbishy dress that I lost the leads out\r\nof the tails with no cut in it but theyre coming into fashion again I\r\nbought it simply to please him I knew it was no good by the finish pity\r\nI changed my mind of going to Todd and Burns as I said and not Lees it\r\nwas just like the shop itself rummage sale a lot of trash I hate those\r\nrich shops get on your nerves nothing kills me altogether only he\r\nthinks he knows a great lot about a womans dress and cooking mathering\r\neverything he can scour off the shelves into it if I went by his advices\r\nevery blessed hat I put on does that suit me yes take that thats alright\r\nthe one like a weddingcake standing up miles off my head he said suited\r\nme or the dishcover one coming down on my backside on pins and needles\r\nabout the shopgirl in that place in Grafton street I had the misfortune\r\nto bring him into and she as insolent as ever she could be with her\r\nsmirk saying Im afraid were giving you too much trouble what shes there\r\nfor but I stared it out of her yes he was awfully stiff and no wonder\r\nbut he changed the second time he looked Poldy pigheaded as usual like\r\nthe soup but I could see him looking very hard at my chest when he stood\r\nup to open the door for me it was nice of him to show me out in any case\r\nIm extremely sorry Mrs Bloom believe me without making it too marked the\r\nfirst time after him being insulted and me being supposed to be his wife\r\nI just half smiled I know my chest was out that way at the door when he\r\nsaid Im extremely sorry and Im sure you were\r\n\r\nyes I think he made them a bit firmer sucking them like that so long he\r\nmade me thirsty titties he calls them I had to laugh yes this one anyhow\r\nstiff the nipple gets for the least thing Ill get him to keep that up\r\nand Ill take those eggs beaten up with marsala fatten them out for him\r\nwhat are all those veins and things curious the way its made 2 the same\r\nin case of twins theyre supposed to represent beauty placed up there\r\nlike those statues in the museum one of them pretending to hide it with\r\nher hand are they so beautiful of course compared with what a man looks\r\nlike with his two bags full and his other thing hanging down out of\r\nhim or sticking up at you like a hatrack no wonder they hide it with a\r\ncabbageleaf that disgusting Cameron highlander behind the meat market or\r\nthat other wretch with the red head behind the tree where the statue\r\nof the fish used to be when I was passing pretending he was pissing\r\nstanding out for me to see it with his babyclothes up to one side the\r\nQueens own they were a nice lot its well the Surreys relieved them\r\ntheyre always trying to show it to you every time nearly I passed\r\noutside the mens greenhouse near the Harcourt street station just to\r\ntry some fellow or other trying to catch my eye as if it was 1 of the\r\n7 wonders of the world O and the stink of those rotten places the night\r\ncoming home with Poldy after the Comerfords party oranges and lemonade\r\nto make you feel nice and watery I went into 1 of them it was so biting\r\ncold I couldnt keep it when was that 93 the canal was frozen yes it was\r\na few months after a pity a couple of the Camerons werent there to see\r\nme squatting in the mens place meadero I tried to draw a picture of\r\nit before I tore it up like a sausage or something I wonder theyre not\r\nafraid going about of getting a kick or a bang of something there the\r\nwoman is beauty of course thats admitted when he said I could pose for a\r\npicture naked to some rich fellow in Holles street when he lost the\r\njob in Helys and I was selling the clothes and strumming in the coffee\r\npalace would I be like that bath of the nymph with my hair down yes only\r\nshes younger or Im a little like that dirty bitch in that Spanish photo\r\nhe has nymphs used they go about like that I asked him about her and\r\nthat word met something with hoses in it and he came out with some\r\njawbreakers about the incarnation he never can explain a thing simply\r\nthe way a body can understand then he goes and burns the bottom out of\r\nthe pan all for his Kidney this one not so much theres the mark of his\r\nteeth still where he tried to bite the nipple I had to scream out arent\r\nthey fearful trying to hurt you I had a great breast of milk with Milly\r\nenough for two what was the reason of that he said I could have got a\r\npound a week as a wet nurse all swelled out the morning that delicate\r\nlooking student that stopped in no 28 with the Citrons Penrose nearly\r\ncaught me washing through the window only for I snapped up the towel to\r\nmy face that was his studenting hurt me they used to weaning her till he\r\ngot doctor Brady to give me the belladonna prescription I had to get him\r\nto suck them they were so hard he said it was sweeter and thicker than\r\ncows then he wanted to milk me into the tea well hes beyond everything I\r\ndeclare somebody ought to put him in the budget if I only could remember\r\nthe one half of the things and write a book out of it the works of\r\nMaster Poldy yes and its so much smoother the skin much an hour he was\r\nat them Im sure by the clock like some kind of a big infant I had at me\r\nthey want everything in their mouth all the pleasure those men get out\r\nof a woman I can feel his mouth O Lord I must stretch myself I wished\r\nhe was here or somebody to let myself go with and come again like that I\r\nfeel all fire inside me or if I could dream it when he made me spend\r\nthe 2nd time tickling me behind with his finger I was coming for about 5\r\nminutes with my legs round him I had to hug him after O Lord I wanted to\r\nshout out all sorts of things fuck or shit or anything at all only not\r\nto look ugly or those lines from the strain who knows the way hed take\r\nit you want to feel your way with a man theyre not all like him thank\r\nGod some of them want you to be so nice about it I noticed the contrast\r\nhe does it and doesnt talk I gave my eyes that look with my hair a bit\r\nloose from the

in bed that morning and Mrs Rubio\r\nbrought it in with the coffee she stood there standing when I asked her\r\nto hand me and I pointing at them I couldnt think of the word a hairpin\r\nto open it with ah horquilla disobliging old thing and it staring her\r\nin the face with her switch of false hair on her and vain about her\r\nappearance ugly as she was near 80 or a 100 her face a mass of wrinkles\r\nwith all her religion domineering because she never could get over the\r\nAtlantic fleet coming in half the ships of the world and the Union Jack\r\nflying with all her carabineros because 4 drunken English sailors took\r\nall the rock from them and because I didnt run into mass often enough in\r\nSanta Maria to please her with her shawl up on her except when there was\r\na marriage on with all her miracles of the saints and her black blessed\r\nvirgin with the silver dress and the sun dancing 3 times on Easter\r\nSunday morning and when the priest was going by with the bell bringing\r\nthe vatican to the dying blessing herself for his Majestad an admirer\r\nhe signed it I near jumped out of my skin I wanted to pick him up when\r\nI saw him following me along the Calle Real in the shop window then\r\nhe tipped me just in passing but I never thought hed write making an\r\nappointment I had it inside my petticoat bodice all day reading it up\r\nin every hole and corner while father was up at the drill instructing to\r\nfind out by the handwriting or the language of stamps singing I remember\r\nshall I wear a white rose and I wanted to put on the old stupid clock to\r\nnear the time he was the first man kissed me under the Moorish wall my\r\nsweetheart when a boy it never entered my head what kissing meant till\r\nhe put his tongue in my mouth his mouth was sweetlike young I put my\r\nknee up to him a few times to learn the way what did I tell him I was\r\nengaged for for fun to the son of a Spanish nobleman named Don Miguel de\r\nla Flora and he believed me that I was to be married to him in 3 years\r\ntime theres many a true word spoken in jest there is a flower that\r\nbloometh a few things I told him true about myself just for him to be\r\nimagining the Spanish girls he didnt like I suppose one of them wouldnt\r\nhave him I got him excited he crushed all the flowers on my bosom he\r\nbrought me he couldnt count the pesetas and the perragordas till I\r\ntaught him Cappoquin he came from he said on the black water but it was\r\ntoo short then the day before he left May yes it was May when the infant\r\nking of Spain was born Im always like that in the spring Id like a new\r\nfellow every year up on the tiptop under the rockgun near OHaras tower\r\nI told him it was struck by lightning and all about the old Barbary apes\r\nthey sent to Clapham without a tail careering all over the show on each\r\nothers back Mrs Rubio said she was a regular old rock scorpion robbing\r\nthe chickens out of Inces farm and throw stones at you if you went anear\r\nhe was looking at me I had that white blouse on open in the front to\r\nencourage him as much as I could without too openly they were just\r\nbeginning to be plump I said I was tired we lay over the firtree cove\r\na wild place I suppose it must be the highest rock in existence the\r\ngalleries and casemates and those frightful rocks and Saint Michaels\r\ncave with the icicles or whatever they call them hanging down and\r\nladders all the mud plotching my boots Im sure thats the way down the\r\nmonkeys go under the sea to Africa when they die the ships out far like\r\nchips that was the Malta boat passing yes the sea and the sky you could\r\ndo what you liked lie there for ever he caressed them outside they love\r\ndoing that its the roundness there I was leaning over him with my white\r\nricestraw hat to take the newness out of it the left side of my face the\r\nbest my blouse open for his last day transparent kind of shirt he had I\r\ncould see his chest pink he wanted to touch mine with his for a moment\r\nbut I wouldnt let him he was awfully put out first for fear you never\r\nknow consumption or leave me with a child embarazada that old servant\r\nInes told me that one drop even if it got into you at all after I tried\r\nwith the Banana but I was afraid it might break and get lost up in me\r\nsomewhere because they once took something down out of a woman that was\r\nup there for years covered with limesalts theyre all mad to get in there\r\nwhere they come out of youd think they could never go far enough up and\r\nthen theyre done with you in a way till the next time yes because theres\r\na wonderful feeling there so tender all the time how did we finish it\r\noff yes O yes I pulled him off into my handkerchief pretending not to\r\nbe excited but I opened my legs I wouldnt let him touch me inside my\r\npetticoat because I had a skirt opening up the side I tormented the\r\nlife out of him first tickling him I

him on the sea all the time after at\r\nmass when my petticoat began to slip down at the elevation weeks and\r\nweeks I kept the handkerchief under my pillow for the smell of him there\r\nwas no decent perfume to be got in that Gibraltar only that cheap peau\r\ndEspagne that faded and left a stink on you more than anything else I\r\nwanted to give him a memento he gave me that clumsy Claddagh ring for\r\nluck that I gave Gardner going to south Africa where those Boers killed\r\nhim with their war and fever but they were well beaten all the same as\r\nif it brought its bad luck with it like an opal or pearl still it must\r\nhave been pure 18 carrot gold because it was very heavy but what could\r\nyou get in a place like that the sandfrog shower from Africa and that\r\nderelict ship that

having him leaving the gas on all\r\nnight I couldnt rest easy in my bed in Gibraltar even getting up to see\r\nwhy am I so damned nervous about that though I like it in the winter its\r\nmore company O Lord it was rotten cold too that winter when I was\r\nonly about ten was I yes I had the big doll with all the funny clothes\r\ndressing her up and undressing that icy wind skeeting across from those\r\nmountains the something Nevada sierra nevada standing at the fire with\r\nthe little bit of a short shift I had up to heat myself I loved dancing\r\nabout in it then make a race back into bed Im sure that fellow opposite\r\nused to be there the whole time watching with the lights out in the\r\nsummer and I in my skin hopping around I used to love myself then\r\nstripped at the washstand dabbing and creaming only when it came to the\r\nchamber performance I put out the light too so then there were 2 of us\r\ngoodbye to my sleep for this night anyhow I hope hes not going to get in\r\nwith those medicals leading him astray to imagine hes young again coming\r\nin at 4 in the morning it must be if not more still he had the manners\r\nnot to wake me what do they find to gabber about all night squandering\r\nmoney and getting drunker and drunker couldnt they drink water then he\r\nstarts giving us his orders for eggs and tea and Findon haddy and hot\r\nbuttered toast I suppose well have him sitting up like the king of\r\nthe country pumping the wrong end of the spoon up and down in his egg\r\nwherever he learned that from and I love to hear him falling up the\r\nstairs of a morning with the cups rattling on the tray and then play\r\nwith the cat she rubs up against you for her own sake I wonder has she\r\nfleas shes as bad as a woman always licking and lecking but I hate their\r\nclaws I wonder do they see anything that we cant staring like that when\r\nshe sits at the top of the stairs so long and listening as I wait always\r\nwhat a robber too that lovely fresh plaice I bought I think Ill get a bit\r\nof fish tomorrow or today is it Friday yes I will with some blancmange\r\nwith black currant jam like long ago not those 2 lb pots of mixed

forgetting anyway Im sick of that\r\neverlasting butchers meat from Buckleys loin chops and leg beef and rib\r\nsteak and scrag of mutton and calfs pluck the very name is enough or\r\na picnic suppose we all gave 5/- each and or let him pay it and invite\r\nsome other woman for him who Mrs Fleming and drove out to the furry glen\r\nor the strawberry beds wed have him examining all the horses toenails\r\nfirst like he does with the letters no not with Boylan there yes with\r\nsome cold veal and ham mixed sandwiches there are little houses down\r\nat the bottom of the banks there on purpose but its as hot as blazes he\r\nsays not a bank holiday anyhow I hate those ruck of Mary Ann coalboxes\r\nout for the day Whit Monday is a cursed day too no wonder that bee bit\r\nhim better the seaside but Id never again in this life get into a boat\r\nwith him after him at Bray telling the boatman he knew how to row if\r\nanyone asked could he ride the steeplechase for the gold cup hed say\r\nyes then it came on to get rough the old thing crookeding about and the\r\nweight all down my side telling me pull the right reins now pull the\r\nleft and the tide all swamping in floods in through the bottom and his\r\noar slipping out of the stirrup its a mercy we werent all drowned he can\r\nswim of course me no theres no danger whatsoever keep yourself calm in\r\nhis flannel trousers Id like to have tattered them down off him before\r\nall the people and give him what that one calls flagellate till he was\r\nblack and blue do him all the good in the world only for that longnosed\r\nchap I dont know who he is with that other beauty Burke out of the City\r\nArms hotel was there spying around as usual on the slip always where he\r\nwasnt wanted if there was a row on youd vomit a better face there was no\r\nlove lost between us thats 1 consolation I wonder what kind is that book\r\nhe brought me Sweets of Sin by a gentleman of fashion some other Mr de\r\nKock I suppose the people gave him that nickname going about with his\r\ntube from one woman to another I couldnt even change my new white shoes\r\nall ruined with the saltwater and the hat I had with that feather all\r\nblowy and tossed on me how annoying and provoking because the smell of\r\nthe sea excited me of course the sardines and the bream in Catalan bay\r\nround the back of the rock they were fine all silver in the fishermens\r\nbaskets old Luigi near a hundred they said came from Genoa and the tall\r\nold chap with the earrings I dont like a man you have to climb up to to\r\nget at I suppose theyre all dead and rotten long ago besides I dont like\r\nbeing alone in this big barracks of a place at night I suppose Ill have\r\nto put up with it I never brought a bit of salt in even when we moved\r\nin the confusion musical academy he was going to make on the first floor\r\ndrawingroom with a brassplate or Blooms private hotel he suggested go\r\nand ruin himself altogether the way his father did down in Ennis like\r\nall the things he told father he was going to do and me but I saw\r\nthrough him telling me all the lovely places we could go for the\r\nhoneymoon Venice by moonlight with the gondolas and the lake of Como he\r\nhad a picture cut out of some paper of and mandolines and lanterns O\r\nhow nice I said whatever I liked he was going to do immediately if\r\nnot sooner will you be my man will you carry my can he ought to get a\r\nleather medal with a putty rim for all the plans he invents then leaving\r\nus here all day youd never know what old beggar at the door for a crust\r\nwith his long story might be a tramp and put his foot in the way to\r\nprevent me shutting it like that picture of that hardened criminal he\r\nwas called in Lloyds Weekly news 20 years in jail then he comes out and\r\nmurders an old woman for her money imagine his poor wife or mother or\r\nwhoever she is such a face youd run miles away from I couldnt rest easy\r\ntill I bolted all the doors and windows to make sure but its worse again\r\nbeing locked up like in a prison or a madhouse they ought to be all shot\r\nor the cat of nine tails a big brute like that that would attack a poor\r\nold woman to murder her in her bed Id cut them off him so I would not\r\nthat hed be much use still better than nothing the night I was sure\r\nI heard burglars in the kitchen and he went down in his shirt with a\r\ncandle and a poker as if he was looking for a mouse as white as a sheet\r\nfrightened out of his wits making as much noise as he possibly could\r\nfor the burglars benefit there isnt much to steal indeed the Lord knows\r\nstill its the feeling especially now with Milly away such an idea for\r\nhim to send the girl down there to learn to take photographs on account\r\nof his grandfather instead of sending her to Skerrys academy where shed\r\nhave to learn not like me getting all at school only hed do a thing like\r\nthat all the same on account of me and Boylan thats why he did it Im\r\ncertain the way he plots and plans everything out I couldnt turn round\r\nwith her in the place lately unless I bolted the door first gave me the\r\nfidgets coming in without knocking first when I put the chair against\r\nthe door just as I was washing myself there below with the glove get on\r\nyour nerves then doing the loglady all day put her in a glasscase with\r\ntwo at a time to look at her if he knew she broke off the hand off that\r\nlittle gimcrack statue with her roughness and carelessness before she\r\nleft that I got that little Italian boy to mend so that you cant see the\r\njoin for 2 shillings wouldnt even teem the potatoes for you of course\r\nshes right not to ruin her hands I noticed he was always talking to her\r\nlately at the table explaining things in the paper and she pretending to\r\nunderstand sly of course that comes from his side of the house he\r\ncant say I pretend things can he Im too honest as a matter of fact and\r\nhelping her into her coat but if there was anything wrong with her its\r\nme shed tell not him I suppose he thinks Im finished out and laid on\r\nthe shelf well Im not no nor anything like it well see well see now shes\r\nwell on for flirting too with Tom Devans two sons imitating me whistling\r\nwith those romps of Murray girls calling for her can Milly come out\r\nplease shes in great demand to pick what they can out of her round in\r\nNelson street riding Harry Devans bicycle at night its as well he sent\r\nher where she is she was just getting out of bounds wanting to go on the\r\nskatingrink and smoking their cigarettes through their nose I smelt it\r\noff her dress when I was biting off the thread of the button I sewed\r\non to the bottom of her jacket she couldnt hide much from me I tell you\r\nonly I oughtnt to have stitched it and it on her it brings a parting and\r\nthe last plumpudding too split in 2 halves see it comes out no matter\r\nwhat they say her tongue is a bit too long for my taste your blouse is\r\nopen too low she says to me the pan calling the kettle blackbottom and\r\nI had to tell her not to cock her legs up like that on show on the\r\nwindowsill before all the people passing they all look at her like me\r\nwhen I was her age of course any old rag looks well on you then a great\r\ntouchmenot too in her own way at the Only Way in the Theatre royal take\r\nyour foot away out of that I hate people touching me afraid of her life\r\nId crush her skirt with the pleats a lot of that touching must go on in\r\ntheatres in the crush in the dark theyre always trying to wiggle up to\r\nyou that fellow in the pit at the Gaiety for Beerbohm Tree in Trilby the\r\nlast time Ill ever go there to be squashed like that for any Trilby or\r\nher barebum every two minutes tipping me there and looking away hes a\r\nbit daft I think I saw him after trying to get near two stylishdressed\r\nladies outside Switzers window at the same little game I recognised him\r\non the moment the face and everything but he didnt remember me yes and\r\nshe didnt even want me to kiss her at the Broadstone going away well I\r\nhope shell get someone to dance attendance on her the way I did when she\r\nwas down with the mumps and her glands swollen wheres this and wheres\r\nthat of course she cant feel anything deep yet I never came properly\r\ntill I was what 22 or so it went into the wrong place always only the\r\nusual girls nonsense and giggling that Conny Connolly writing to her in\r\nwhite ink on black paper sealed with sealingwax though she clapped when\r\nthe curtain came down because he looked so handsome then we had Martin\r\nHarvey for breakfast dinner and supper I thought to myself afterwards\r\nit must be real love if a man gives up his life for her that way for\r\nnothing I suppose there are a few men like that left its hard to believe\r\nin it though unless it really happened to me the majority of them with\r\nnot a particle of love in their natures to find two people like that\r\nnowadays full up of each other that would feel the same way as you do\r\ntheyre usually a bit foolish in the head his father must have been a bit\r\nqueer to go and poison himself after her still poor old man I suppose\r\nhe felt lost shes always making love to my things too the few old rags I\r\nhave wanting to put her hair up at 15 my powder too only ruin her\r\nskin on her shes time enough for that all her life after of course shes\r\nrestless knowing shes pretty with her lips so red a pity they wont stay\r\nthat way I was too but theres no use going to the fair with the thing\r\nanswering me like a fishwoman when I asked to go for a half a stone of\r\npotatoes the day we met Mrs Joe Gallaher at the trottingmatches and she\r\npretended not to see us in her trap with Friery the solicitor we werent\r\ngrand enough till I gave her 2 damn fine cracks across the ear for\r\nherself take that now for answering me like that and that for your\r\nimpudence she had me that exasperated of course contradicting I was\r\nbadtempered too because how was it there was a weed in the tea or I\r\ndidnt sleep the night before cheese I ate was it and I told her over and\r\nover again not to leave knives crossed like that because she has nobody\r\nto command her as she said herself well if he doesnt correct her faith\r\nI will that was the last time she turned on the teartap I was just like\r\nthat myself they darent order me about the place its his fault of course\r\nhaving the two of us slaving here instead of getting in a woman long ago\r\nam I ever going to have a proper servant again of course then shed\r\nsee him coming Id have to let her know or shed revenge it arent they\r\na nuisance that old Mrs Fleming you have to be walking round after her\r\nputting the things into her hands sneezing and farting into the pots\r\nwell of course shes old she cant help it a good job I found that rotten\r\nold smelly dishcloth that got lost behind the dresser I knew there was\r\nsomething and opened the area window to let out the smell bringing in\r\nhis friends to entertain them like the night he walked home with a dog\r\nif you please that might have been mad especially Simon Dedalus son his\r\nfather such a criticiser with his glasses up with his tall hat on him at\r\nthe cricket match and a great big hole in his sock one thing laughing at\r\nthe other and his son that got all those prizes for whatever he won them\r\nin the intermediate imagine climbing over the railings if anybody saw\r\nhim that knew us I wonder he didnt tear a big hole in his grand funeral\r\ntrousers as if the one nature gave wasnt enough for anybody hawking him\r\ndown into the dirty old kitchen now is he right in his head I ask pity\r\nit wasnt washing day my old pair of drawers might have been hanging up\r\ntoo on the line on exhibition for all hed ever care with the ironmould\r\nmark the stupid old bundle burned on them he might think was something\r\nelse and she never even rendered down the fat I told her and now shes\r\ngoing such as she was on account of her paralysed husband getting worse\r\ntheres always something wrong with them disease or they have to go under\r\nan operation or if its not that its drink and he beats her Ill have to\r\nhunt around again for someone every day I get up theres some new thing\r\non sweet God sweet God well when Im stretched out dead in my grave I\r\nsuppose Ill have some peace I want to get up a minute if Im let wait O\r\nJesus wait yes that thing has come on me yes now wouldnt that afflict\r\nyou of course all the poking and rooting and ploughing he had up in me\r\nnow what am I to do Friday Saturday Sunday wouldnt that pester the soul\r\nout of a body unless he likes it some men do God knows theres always\r\nsomething wrong with us 5 days every 3 or 4 weeks usual monthly auction\r\nisnt it simply sickening that night it came on me like that the one and\r\nonly time we were in a box that Michael Gunn gave him to see Mrs Kendal\r\nand her husband at the Gaiety something he did about insurance for him\r\nin Drimmies I was fit to be tied though I wouldnt give in with that\r\ngentleman of fashion staring down at me with his glasses and him the\r\nother side of me talking about Spinoza and his soul thats dead I suppose\r\nmillions of years ago I smiled the best I could all in a swamp leaning\r\nforward as if I was interested having to sit it out then to the last tag\r\nI wont forget that wife of Scarli in a hurry supposed to be a fast play\r\nabout adultery that idiot in the gallery hissing the woman adulteress he\r\nshouted I suppose he went and had a woman in the next lane running round\r\nall the back ways after to make up for it I wish he had what I had then\r\nhed boo I bet the cat itself is better off than us have we too much\r\nblood up in us or what O patience above its pouring out of me like the\r\nsea anyhow he didnt make me pregnant as big as he is I dont want to ruin\r\nthe clean sheets I just put on I suppose the clean linen I wore brought\r\nit on too damn it damn it and they always want to see a stain on the\r\nbed to know youre a virgin for them all thats troubling them theyre such\r\nfools too you could be a widow or divorced 40 times over a daub of red\r\nink would do or blackberry juice no thats too purply O Jamesy let me up\r\nout of this pooh sweets of sin whoever suggested that business for women\r\nwhat between clothes and cooking and children this damned old bed too\r\njingling like the dickens I suppose they could hear us away over the\r\nother side of the park till I suggested to put the quilt on the floor\r\nwith the pillow under my bottom I wonder is it nicer in the day I think\r\nit is easy I think Ill cut all this hair off me there scalding me I\r\nmight look like a young girl wouldnt he get the great suckin the next\r\ntime he turned up my clothes on me Id give anything to see his face\r\nwheres the chamber gone easy Ive a holy horror of its breaking under me\r\nafter that old commode I wonder was I too heavy sitting on his knee I\r\nmade him sit on the easychair purposely when I took off only my blouse\r\nand skirt first in the other room he was so busy where he oughtnt to be\r\nhe never felt me I hope my breath was sweet after those kissing comfits\r\neasy God I remember one time I could scout it out straight whistling\r\nlike a man almost easy O Lord how noisy I hope theyre bubbles on it for\r\na wad of money from some fellow Ill have to perfume it in the morning\r\ndont forget I bet he never saw a better pair of thighs than that look\r\nhow white they are the smoothest place is right there between this bit\r\nhere how soft like a peach easy God I wouldnt mind being a man and get\r\nup on a lovely woman O Lord what a row youre making like the jersey lily\r\neasy easy O how the waters come down at Lahore\r\n\r\nwho knows is there anything the matter with my insides or have I\r\nsomething growing in me getting that thing like that every week when was\r\nit last I Whit Monday yes its only about 3 weeks I ought to go to the\r\ndoctor only it would be like before I married him when I had that white\r\nthing coming from me and Floey made me go to that dry old stick Dr\r\nCollins for womens diseases on Pembroke road your vagina he called it I\r\nsuppose thats how he got all the gilt mirrors and carpets getting round\r\nthose rich ones off Stephens green running up to him for every little\r\nfiddlefaddle her vagina and her cochinchina theyve money of course so\r\ntheyre all right I wouldnt marry him not if he was the last man in\r\nthe world besides theres something queer about their children always\r\nsmelling around those filthy bitches all sides asking me if what I did\r\nhad an offensive odour what did he want me to do but the one thing gold\r\nmaybe what a question if I smathered it all over his wrinkly old face\r\nfor him with all my compriment I suppose hed know then and could you\r\npass it easily pass what I thought he was talking about the rock of\r\nGibraltar the way he put it thats a very nice invention too by the\r\nway only I like letting myself down after in the hole as far as I can\r\nsqueeze and pull the chain then to flush it nice cool pins and needles\r\nstill theres something in it I suppose I always used to know by Millys\r\nwhen she was a child whether she had worms or not still all the same\r\npaying him for that how much is that doctor one guinea please and asking\r\nme had I frequent omissions where do those old fellows get all the words\r\nthey have omissions with his shortsighted eyes on me cocked sideways I\r\nwouldnt trust him too far to give me chloroform or God knows what else\r\nstill I liked him when he sat down to write the thing out frowning so\r\nsevere his nose intelligent like that you be damned you lying strap O\r\nanything no matter who except an idiot he was clever enough to spot\r\nthat of course that was all thinking of him and his mad crazy letters\r\nmy Precious one everything connected with your glorious Body everything\r\nunderlined that comes from it is a thing of beauty and of joy for ever\r\nsomething he got out of some nonsensical book that he had me always at\r\nmyself 4 and 5 times a day sometimes and I said I hadnt are you sure\r\nO yes I said I am quite sure in a way that shut him up I knew what was\r\ncoming next only natural weakness it was he excited me I dont know how\r\nthe first night ever we met when I was living in Rehoboth terrace we\r\nstood staring at one another for about 10 minutes as if we met somewhere\r\nI suppose on account of my being jewess looking after my mother he used\r\nto amuse me the things he said with the half sloothering smile on him\r\nand all the Doyles said he was going to stand for a member of Parliament\r\nO wasnt I the born fool to believe all his blather about home rule\r\nand the land league sending me that long strool of a song out of the\r\nHuguenots to sing in French to be more classy O beau pays de la Touraine\r\nthat I never even sang once explaining and rigmaroling about religion\r\nand persecution he wont let you enjoy anything naturally then might he\r\nas a great favour the very 1st opportunity he got a chance in Brighton\r\nsquare running into my bedroom pretending the ink got on his hands to\r\nwash it off with the Albion milk and sulphur soap I used to use and the\r\ngelatine still round it O I laughed myself sick at him that day I better\r\nnot make an alnight sitting on this affair they ought to make chambers a\r\nnatural size so that a woman could sit on it properly he kneels down to\r\ndo it I suppose there isnt in all creation another man with the habits\r\nhe has look at the way hes sleeping at the foot of the bed how can he\r\nwithout a hard bolster its well he doesnt kick or he might knock out\r\nall my teeth breathing with his hand on his nose like that Indian god\r\nhe took me to show one wet Sunday in the museum in Kildare street all\r\nyellow in a pinafore lying on his side on his hand with his ten toes\r\nsticking out that he said was a bigger religion than the jews and\r\nOur Lords both put together all over Asia imitating him as hes always\r\nimitating everybody I suppose he used to sleep at the foot of the bed\r\ntoo with his big square feet up in his wifes mouth damn this stinking\r\nthing anyway wheres this those napkins are ah yes I know I hope the

thing he slept on the floor\r\nhalf the night naked the way the jews used when somebody dies belonged\r\nto them and wouldnt eat any breakfast or speak a word wanting to be\r\npetted so I thought I stood out enough for one time and let him he does\r\nit all wrong too thinking only of his own pleasure his tongue is too\r\nflat or I dont know what he forgets that we then I dont Ill make him do\r\nit again if he doesnt mind himself and lock him down to sleep in the\r\ncoalcellar with the blackbeetles I wonder was it her Josie off her head\r\nwith my castoffs hes such a born liar too no

some little bitch hes got in with even when I was\r\nwith him with Milly at the College races that Hornblower with the childs\r\nbonnet on the top of his nob let us into by the back way he was throwing\r\nhis sheeps eyes at those two doing skirt duty up and down I tried to\r\nwink at him first no use of course and thats the way his money goes this\r\nis the fruits of Mr Paddy Dignam yes they were all in great style at the\r\ngrand funeral in the paper Boylan brought in if they saw a real officers\r\nfuneral thatd be something reversed arms muffled drums the poor horse\r\nwalking behind in black L Boom and Tom Kernan that drunken little\r\nbarrelly man that bit his tongue off falling down the mens W C drunk\r\nin some place or other and Martin Cunningham and the two Dedaluses and\r\nFanny MCoys husband white head of cabbage skinny thing with a turn in\r\nher eye trying to sing my songs shed want to be born all over again and\r\nher old green dress with the lowneck as she cant attract them any other\r\nway like dabbling on a rainy day I see it all now plainly and they call\r\nthat friendship killing and then burying one another and they all with\r\ntheir wives and families at home more especially Jack Power keeping that\r\nbarmaid he does of course his wife is always sick or going to be sick\r\nor just getting better of it and hes a goodlooking man still though\r\nhes getting a bit grey over the ears theyre a nice lot all of them well\r\ntheyre not going to get my husband again into their clutches if I can\r\nhelp it making fun of him then behind his back I know well when he goes\r\non with his idiotics because he has sense enough not to squander every\r\npenny piece he earns down their gullets and looks after his wife and\r\nfamily goodfornothings poor Paddy Dignam all the same Im sorry in a\r\nway for him what are his wife and 5 children going to do unless he was\r\ninsured comical little teetotum always stuck up in some pub corner and\r\nher or her son waiting Bill Bailey wont you please come home her widows\r\nweeds wont improve her appearance theyre awfully becoming though if\r\nyoure goodlooking what men wasnt he yes he was at the Glencree dinner\r\nand Ben Dollard base barreltone the night he borrowed the swallowtail\r\nto sing out of in Holles street squeezed and squashed into them and\r\ngrinning all over his big Dolly face like a wellwhipped childs botty\r\ndidnt he look a balmy ballocks sure enough that must have been a\r\nspectacle on the stage imagine paying 5/- in the preserved seats for\r\nthat to see him trotting off in his trowlers and Simon Dedalus too he\r\nwas always turning up half screwed singing the second verse first the\r\nold love is the new was one of his so sweetly sang the maiden on the\r\nhawthorn bough he was always on for flirtyfying too when I sang Maritana\r\nwith him at Freddy Mayers private opera he had a delicious glorious\r\nvoice Phoebe dearest goodbye sweetheart sweetheart he always sang it not\r\nlike Bartell DArcy sweet _tart_ goodbye of course he had the gift of the\r\nvoice so there was no art in it all over you like a warm showerbath O\r\nMaritana wildwood flower we sang splendidly though it was a bit too high\r\nfor my register even transposed and he was married at the time to May\r\nGoulding but then hed say or do something to knock the good out of it\r\nhes a widower now I wonder what sort is his son he says hes an author\r\nand going to be a university professor of Italian and Im to take lessons\r\nwhat is he driving at now showing him my photo its not good of me I\r\nought to have got it taken in drapery that never looks out of fashion\r\nstill I look young in it I wonder he didnt make him a present of it\r\naltogether and me too after all why not I saw him driving down to the\r\nKingsbridge station with his father and mother I was in mourning thats\r\n11 years ago now yes hed be 11 though what was the good in going into\r\nmourning for what was neither one thing nor the other the first cry was\r\nenough for me I heard the deathwatch too ticking in the wall of course\r\nhe insisted hed go into mourning for the cat I suppose hes a man now by\r\nthis time he was an innocent boy then and a darling little fellow in his\r\nlord Fauntleroy suit and curly hair like a prince on the stage when I\r\nsaw him at Mat Dillons he liked me too I remember they all do wait by\r\nGod yes wait yes hold on he was on the cards this morning when I laid\r\nout the deck union with a young stranger neither dark nor fair you met\r\nbefore I thought it meant him but hes no chicken nor a stranger either\r\nbesides my face was turned the other way what was the 7th card after\r\nthat the 10 of spades for a journey by land then there was a letter on\r\nits way and scandals too the 3 queens and the 8 of diamonds for a rise\r\nin society yes wait it all came out and 2 red 8s for new garments look\r\nat that and didnt I dream something too yes there was something about\r\npoetry in it I hope he hasnt long greasy hair hanging into his eyes or\r\nstanding up like a red Indian what do they go about like that for only\r\ngetting themselves and their poetry laughed at I always liked poetry\r\nwhen I was a girl first I thought he was a poet like lord Byron and not\r\nan ounce of it in his composition I thought he was quite different I\r\nwonder is he too young hes about wait 88 I was married 88 Milly is 15\r\nyesterday 89 what age was he then at Dillons 5 or 6 about 88 I suppose\r\nhes 20 or more Im not too old for him if hes 23 or 24 I hope hes not\r\nthat stuckup university student sort no otherwise he wouldnt go sitting\r\ndown in the old kitchen with him taking Eppss cocoa and talking of\r\ncourse he pretended to understand it all probably he told him he was\r\nout of Trinity college hes very young to be a professor I hope hes not\r\na professor like Goodwin was he was a potent professor of John Jameson\r\nthey all write about some woman in their poetry well I suppose he wont\r\nfind many like me where softly sighs of love the light guitar where\r\npoetry is in the air the blue sea and the moon shining so beautifully\r\ncoming back on the nightboat from Tarifa the lighthouse at Europa point\r\nthe guitar that fellow played was so expressive will I ever go back\r\nthere again all new faces two glancing eyes a lattice hid Ill sing that\r\nfor him theyre my eyes if hes anything of a poet two eyes as darkly\r\nbright as loves own star arent those beautiful words as loves young star\r\nitll be a change the Lord knows to have an intelligent person to talk\r\nto about yourself not always listening to him and Billy Prescotts ad\r\nand Keyess ad and Tom the Devils ad then if anything goes wrong in their\r\nbusiness we have to suffer Im sure hes very distinguished Id like to\r\nmeet a man like that God not those other ruck besides hes young those\r\nfine young men I could see down in Margate strand bathingplace from the\r\nside of the rock standing up in the sun naked like a God or something\r\nand then plunging into the sea with them why arent all men like that\r\nthered be some consolation for a woman like that lovely little statue he\r\nbought I could look at him all day long curly head and his shoulders\r\nhis finger up for you to listen theres real beauty and poetry for you\r\nI often felt I wanted to kiss him all over also his lovely young cock\r\nthere so simple I wouldnt mind taking him in my mouth if nobody was\r\nlooking as if it was asking you to suck it so clean and white he looks\r\nwith his boyish face I would too in 1/2 a minute even if some of it went\r\ndown what its only like gruel or the dew theres no danger besides hed\r\nbe so clean compared with those pigs of men I suppose never dream of\r\nwashing it from 1 years end to the other the most of them only thats\r\nwhat gives the women the moustaches Im sure itll be grand if I can only\r\nget in with a handsome young poet at my age Ill throw them the 1st thing\r\nin the morning till I see if the wishcard comes out or Ill try pairing\r\nthe lady herself and see if he comes out Ill read and study all I can\r\nfind or learn a bit off by heart if I knew who he likes so he wont think\r\nme stupid if he thinks all women are the same and I can teach him the\r\nother part Ill make him feel all over him till he half faints under\r\nme then hell write about me lover and mistress publicly too with our 2\r\nphotographs in all the papers when he becomes famous O but then what am\r\nI going to do about him though\r\n\r\nno thats no way for him has he no manners nor no refinement nor no\r\nnothing in his nature slapping us behind like that on my bottom because\r\nI didnt call him Hugh the ignoramus that doesnt know poetry from a\r\ncabbage thats what you get for not keeping them in their proper place\r\npulling off his shoes and trousers there on the chair before me so\r\nbarefaced without even asking permission and standing out that vulgar\r\nway in the half of a shirt they wear to be admired like a priest or a\r\nbutcher or those old hypocrites in the time of Julius Caesar of course\r\nhes right enough in his way to pass the time as a joke sure you might\r\nas well be in bed with what with a lion God Im sure hed have something\r\nbetter to say for himself an old Lion would O well I suppose its because\r\nthey were so plump and tempting in my short petticoat he couldnt resist\r\nthey excite myself sometimes its well for men all the amount of pleasure\r\nthey get off a womans body were so round and white for them always I\r\nwished I was one myself for a change just to try with that thing they\r\nhave swelling up on you so hard and at the same time so soft when you\r\ntouch it my uncle John has a thing long I heard those cornerboys saying\r\npassing the comer of Marrowbone lane my aunt Mary has a thing hairy\r\nbecause it was dark and they knew a girl was passing it didnt make me\r\nblush why should it either its only nature and he puts his thing long\r\ninto my aunt Marys hairy etcetera and turns out to be you put the handle\r\nin a sweepingbrush men again all over they can pick and choose what they\r\nplease a married woman or a fast widow or a girl for their different\r\ntastes like those houses round behind Irish street no but were to be\r\nalways chained up theyre not going to be chaining me up no damn fear\r\nonce I start I tell you for their stupid husbands jealousy why cant we\r\nall remain friends over it instead of quarrelling her husband found it\r\nout what they did together well naturally and if he did can he undo it\r\nhes coronado anyway whatever he does and then he going to the other\r\nmad extreme about the wife in Fair Tyrants of course the man never even\r\ncasts a 2nd thought on the husband or wife either its the woman he wants\r\nand he gets her what else were we given all those desires for Id like to\r\nknow I cant help it if Im young still can I its a wonder Im not an old\r\nshrivelled hag before my time living with him so cold never embracing\r\nme except sometimes when hes asleep the wrong end of me not knowing I\r\nsuppose who he has any man thatd kiss a womans bottom Id throw my hat at\r\nhim after that hed kiss anything unnatural where we havent 1 atom of any\r\nkind of expression in us all of us the same 2 lumps of lard before ever\r\nId do that to a man pfooh the dirty brutes the mere thought is enough\r\nI kiss the feet of you senorita theres some sense in that didnt he kiss\r\nour halldoor yes he did what a madman nobody understands his cracked\r\nideas but me still of course a woman wants to be embraced 20 times a day\r\nalmost to make her look young no matter by who so long as to be in love\r\nor loved by somebody if the fellow you want isnt there sometimes by the\r\nLord God I was thinking would I go around by the quays there some dark\r\nevening where nobodyd know me and pick up a sailor off the sea thatd be\r\nhot on for it and not care a pin whose I was only do it off up in a gate\r\nsomewhere or one of those wildlooking gipsies in Rathfarnham had their\r\ncamp pitched near the Bloomfield laundry to try and steal our things if\r\nthey could I only sent mine there a few times for the name model\r\nlaundry sending me back over and over some old ones odd stockings that\r\nblackguardlooking fellow with the fine eyes peeling a switch attack me\r\nin the dark and ride me up against the wall without a word or a murderer\r\nanybody what they do themselves the fine gentlemen in their silk hats\r\nthat K C lives up somewhere this way coming out of Hardwicke lane the\r\nnight he gave us the fish supper on account of winning over the boxing\r\nmatch of course it was for me he gave it I knew him by his gaiters and\r\nthe walk and when I turned round a minute after just to see there was\r\na woman after coming out of it too some filthy prostitute then he goes\r\nhome to his wife after that only I suppose the half of those sailors are\r\nrotten again with disease O move over your big carcass out of that for\r\nthe love of Mike listen to him the winds that waft my sighs to thee so\r\nwell he may sleep and sigh the great Suggester Don Poldo de la Flora if\r\nhe knew how he came out on the cards this morning hed have something to\r\nsigh for a dark man in some perplexity between 2 7s too in prison for\r\nLord knows what he does that I dont know and Im to be slooching around\r\ndown in the kitchen to get his lordship his breakfast while hes rolled\r\nup like a mummy will I indeed did you ever see me running Id just like\r\nto see myself at it show them attention and they treat you like dirt\r\nI dont care what anybody says itd be much better for the world to be\r\ngoverned by the women in it you wouldnt see women going and killing one\r\nanother and slaughtering when do you ever see women rolling around drunk\r\nlike they do or gambling every penny they have and losing it on horses\r\nyes because a woman whatever she does she knows where to stop sure they\r\nwouldnt be in the world at all only for us they dont know what it is to\r\nbe a woman and a mother how could they where would they all of them be\r\nif they hadnt all a mother to look after them what I never had thats\r\nwhy I suppose hes running wild now out at night away from his books\r\nand studies and not living at home on account of the usual rowy house I\r\nsuppose well its a poor case that those that have a fine son like that\r\ntheyre not satisfied and I none was he not able to make one it wasnt my\r\nfault we came together when I was watching the two dogs up in her behind\r\nin the middle of the naked street that disheartened me altogether I\r\nsuppose I oughtnt to have buried him in that little woolly jacket I\r\nknitted crying as I was but give it to some poor child but I knew well\r\nId never have another our 1st death too it was we were never the same\r\nsince O Im not going to think myself into the glooms about that any\r\nmore I wonder why he wouldnt stay the night I felt all the time it was\r\nsomebody strange he brought in instead of roving around the city meeting\r\nGod knows who nightwalkers and pickpockets his poor mother wouldnt\r\nlike that if she was alive ruining himself for life perhaps still its a\r\nlovely hour so silent I used to love coming home after dances the air of\r\nthe night they have friends they can talk to weve none either he wants\r\nwhat he wont get or its some woman ready to stick her knife in you I\r\nhate that in women no wonder they treat us the way they do we are a\r\ndreadful lot of bitches I suppose its all the troubles we have makes us\r\nso snappy Im not like that he could easy have slept in there on the sofa\r\nin the other room I suppose he was as shy as a boy he being so young\r\nhardly 20 of me in the next room hed have heard me on the chamber arrah\r\nwhat harm Dedalus I wonder its like those names in Gibraltar Delapaz\r\nDelagracia they had the devils queer names there father Vilaplana of\r\nSanta Maria that gave me the rosary Rosales y OReilly in the Calle las\r\nSiete Revueltas and Pisimbo and Mrs Opisso in Governor street O what a\r\nname Id go and drown myself in the first river if I had a name like\r\nher O my and all the bits of streets Paradise ramp and Bedlam ramp and\r\nRodgers ramp and Crutchetts ramp and the devils gap steps well small\r\nblame to me if I am a harumscarum I know I am a bit I declare to God I\r\ndont feel a day older than then I wonder could I get my tongue round\r\nany of the Spanish como esta usted muy bien gracias y usted see I havent\r\nforgotten it all I thought I had only for the grammar a noun is the\r\nname of any person place or thing pity I never tried to read that novel\r\ncantankerous Mrs Rubio lent me by Valera with the questions in it all\r\nupside down the two ways I always knew wed go away in the end I can\r\ntell him the Spanish and he tell me the Italian then hell see Im not\r\nso ignorant what a pity he didnt stay Im sure the poor fellow was dead\r\ntired and wanted a good sleep badly I could have brought him in his\r\nbreakfast in bed with a bit of toast so long as I didnt do it on\r\nthe knife for bad luck or if the woman was going her rounds with the\r\nwatercress and something nice and tasty there are a few olives in the\r\nkitchen he might like I never could bear the look of them in Abrines\r\nI could do the criada the room looks all right since I changed it the\r\nother way you see something was telling me all the time Id have to\r\nintroduce myself not knowing me from Adam very funny wouldnt it Im his\r\nwife or pretend we were in Spain with him half awake without a Gods\r\nnotion where he is dos huevos estrellados senor Lord the cracked things\r\ncome into my head sometimes itd be great fun supposing he stayed with us\r\nwhy not theres the room upstairs empty and Millys bed in the back room\r\nhe could do his writing and studies at the table in there for all the\r\nscribbling he does at it and if he wants to read in bed in the morning\r\nlike me as hes making the breakfast for 1 he can make it for 2 Im sure\r\nIm not going to take in lodgers off the street for him if he takes\r\na gesabo of a house like this Id love to have a long talk with an\r\nintelligent welleducated person Id have to get a nice pair of red\r\nslippers like those Turks with the fez used to sell or yellow and a\r\nnice semitransparent morning gown that I badly want or a peachblossom\r\ndressing jacket like the one long ago in Walpoles only 8/6 or 18/6 Ill\r\njust give him one more chance Ill get up early in the morning Im sick of\r\nCohens old bed in any case I might go over to the markets to see all\r\nthe vegetables and cabbages and tomatoes and carrots and all kinds of\r\nsplendid fruits all coming in lovely and fresh who knows whod be the 1st\r\nman Id meet theyre out looking for it in the morning Mamy Dillon used\r\nto say they are and the night too that was her massgoing Id love a\r\nbig juicy pear now to melt in your mouth like when I used to be in the\r\nlonging way then Ill throw him up his eggs and tea in the moustachecup\r\nshe gave him to make his mouth bigger I suppose hed like my nice cream\r\ntoo I know what Ill do Ill go about rather gay not too much singing a\r\nbit now and then mi fa piet\xc3\xa0 Masetto then Ill start dressing myself to\r\ngo out presto non son pi\xc3\xb9 forte Ill put on my best shift

nearly not by him 5 or 6 times\r\nhandrunning theres the mark of his spunk on the clean sheet I wouldnt\r\nbother to even iron it out that ought to satisfy him if you dont believe\r\nme feel my belly unless I made him stand there and put him into me Ive a\r\nmind to tell him every scrap and make him do it out in front of me serve\r\nhim right its all his own fault if I am an adulteress as the thing in\r\nthe gallery said O much about it if thats all the harm ever we did in\r\nthis vale of tears God knows its not much doesnt everybody only they\r\nhide it I suppose thats what a woman is supposed to be there for or\r\nHe wouldnt have made us the way He did so attractive to men then if he\r\nwants to kiss my bottom Ill drag open my drawers and bulge it right out\r\nin his face as large as life he can stick his tongue 7 miles up my hole\r\nas hes there my brown part then Ill tell him I want \xc2\xa3 1 or perhaps 30/-\r\nIll tell him I want to buy underclothes then if he gives me that well he\r\nwont be too bad I dont want to soak it all out of him like other women\r\ndo I could often have written out a fine cheque for myself and write his\r\nname on it for a couple of pounds a few times he forgot to lock it up\r\nbesides he wont spend it Ill let him do it off on me behind provided he\r\ndoesnt smear all my good drawers O I suppose that cant be helped Ill do\r\nthe indifferent 1

beautiful country with the fields of oats and\r\nwheat and all kinds of things and all the fine cattle going about that\r\nwould do your heart good to see rivers and lakes and flowers all sorts\r\nof shapes and smells and colours springing up even out of the ditches\r\nprimroses and violets nature it is as for them saying theres no God I\r\nwouldnt give a snap of my two fingers for all their learning why dont\r\nthey go and create something I often asked him atheists or whatever they\r\ncall themselves go and wash the cobbles off themselves first then they\r\ngo howling for the priest and

all who ah that they dont know neither do I so there you\r\nare they might as well try to stop the sun from rising tomorrow the sun\r\nshines for you he said the day we were lying among the rhododendrons on\r\nHowth head in the grey tweed suit and his straw hat the day I got him to\r\npropose to me yes first I gave him the bit of seedcake out of my mouth\r\nand it was leapyear like now yes 16 years ago my God after that long\r\nkiss I near lost my breath yes he said I was a flower of the mountain\r\nyes so we are flowers all a womans body yes that was one true thing he\r\nsaid in his life and the sun shines for you today yes that was why I\r\nliked him because I saw he understood or felt what a woman is and I knew\r\nI could always get round him and I gave him all the pleasure I could\r\nleading him on till he asked me to say yes and I wouldnt answer first\r\nonly looked out over the sea and the sky I was thinking of so many\r\nthings he didnt know of Mulvey and Mr Stanhope and Hester and father and\r\nold captain Groves and the sailors playing all birds fly and I say stoop\r\nand washing up dishes they called it on the pier and the sentry in front\r\nof the governors house with the thing round his white helmet poor devil\r\nhalf roasted and the Spanish girls laughing in their shawls and their\r\ntall combs and the auctions in the morning the Greeks and the jews

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\xe2\x80\x99s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will remain\r\nfreely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure and\r\npermanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations. To\r\nlearn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and\r\nhow your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4 and the\r\nFoundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.

The Foundation\xe2\x80\x99s EIN or federal tax identification number\r\nis 64-6221541. Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\r\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\r\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state\xe2\x80\x99s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\xe2\x80\x99s principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\r\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\r\nthroughout numerous locations.

Newby\r\n     Chief Executive and Director\r\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide spread\r\npublic support and donations to carry out its mission of increasing\r\nthe number of public domain and licensed works that can be freely\r\ndistributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest array\r\nof equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations ($1 to\r\n$5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with\r\nthe IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\r\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state\r\nvisit http://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make any\r\nstatements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside\r\nthe United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other ways\r\nincluding checks, online payments and credit card donations. To donate,\r\nplease visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone. For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S. unless\r\na copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not necessarily keep eBooks\r\nin compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm, including\r\nhow to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\r\nFoundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to subscribe to\r\nour email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n'
